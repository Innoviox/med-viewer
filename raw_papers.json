Although this extensive data availability quickly facilitated the development of vaccine candidates1, major challenges in the analysis of this enormous dataset persist, limiting the ability of public health officials to translate science into policy. Having evolved over a short period of time, the SARS-CoV-2 isolates show low diversity, necessitating analysis of trees built from genome-scale data. Here we provide a complete ancestral genome reconstruction for SARS-CoV-2 leveraging Fitch Traceback2. We show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over the course of the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection. However, a small set of sites, including the extensively studied spike 6143, harbor mutations which recurred on multiple, independent occasions, indicative of positive selection. These mutations form a strongly connected network of apparent epistatic interactions. The phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 consists of 7 major clades which show distinct global and temporal dynamics.

However, until now, there is no vaccine or specific drug to prevent or treat COVID-19. Objectives: To find out the effective treatment as an antiviral agent for COVID-19, to determine the correlation between sociodemography with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment, and to determine the relationship between comorbidities with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in this study. This study included only confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the hospital during April-May 2020. Convenience sampling was used to select 103 patients, but only 72 patients were suitable for inclusion. Results: The survival analysis for COVID-19 patients using the Kaplan Meier method showed that patients receiving Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine had an average survival rate of about 83% after undergoing treatment for about ten days. Gender (p = 0.450) and age (p = 0.226) did not have a significant correlation with the duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients.

Also, the role of these markers in governing virus specific immunity following infection remains largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of systemic and gut inflammatory markers in disease progression and development of anti-viral humoral immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study (n=58) of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals included a group of in-patients (n=36) at various stages of disease progression together with convalescent individuals (n=22) recruited between April and June 2020 (peak of the epidemic) from a tertiary care hospital in Mumbai, India. Follow-up of 11 in-patients at day 7 post diagnosis was carried out, resulting in a total of 47 in-patient samples. EXPOSURES: Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based testing of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the measurement of inflammatory markers including Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines and levels of soluble mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (sMAdCAM) in plasma. Anti-viral humoral response was measured by rapid antibody test (IgG, IgM) and chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) (IgG). Also antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Secondary outcomes were correlation of the inflammatory signature with clinical information, including age, sex, disease duration and co-morbidities. RESULTS: Twenty eight of 36 (78%) in-patients and 19 of 22 (86%) convalescents were males. Out of 47 in-patient samples, 22 (46%), 11 (23%) and 14 (30%) were IgG-/IgM-, IgG+/IgM+ and IgG+/IgM- respectively. Of 22 convalescent samples, 3 (14%), 1 (4%) and 17 (77%) were respectively IgG-/IgM-, IgG+/IgM+ and IgG+/IgM-. Two out of 22 (9%) convalescents showed high IL-6 levels (>100pg/ml) and 4 (18%) had high TNF levels (>30pg/ml). However, the convalescents (n =22) had significantly lower levels of IL-6 [Median=27.48 (IQR=23.54-39.92)] compared to followed up in-patients (n = 11) at day 0 [Median=111(IQR=68-129.7), p =0.0002] and higher levels of sMAdCAM [Median=1940 (1711-2174) pg/ml] compared to these individuals at day 0 [Median=1701 (IQR=1532-1836) pg/ml; p=0.032] and day 7 [Median=1534 (IQR=1236-1654) pg/ml; p=0.0007]. Further, IL-6 and sMAdCAM levels among in-patients inversely correlated with one another (r =-0.374, p = 0.009, CI = 95%). When expressed as a novel integrated marker, sMIL (sMAdCAM/IL-6 ratio) index, these levels were incrementally and significantly higher across various disease states with convalescents exhibiting the highest values [Median= 64.74 (IQR=47.33-85.58)]. Also, the sMIL index was significantly higher in convalescents (with class-switched responses) compared to IgG+/IgM+ individuals at early stages of infection [Median=28.65 (IQR=13.63-96.26), p = 0.034]. Real-time measurement by SPR of plasma antibody binding to viral nucleocapsid (NC), receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike (S) revealed waxing and waning of plasma antibody responses to all 3 targets. Importantly, sMAdCAM levels as well as sMIL index (fold change) correlated with peak association rates of RBD-binding (r = 0.462, p = 0.03, CI = 95%) and fold change in binding to S (r = 0.68, p = 0.050, CI = 95%) respectively.

Methods and findings A cross sectional study of all those diagnosed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between April 1 and May 24 in Argentina was conducted. The data includes clinical and demographic information from all subjects at the time of presentation, which were uploaded to the centralized national reporting system at health centers. A total of 67318 individuals were included in this study, where 12% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The study population was divided in two age groups, a group aged 0 to 55 years-old (<56 group), (median = 32, n=48748) and another group aged 56 to 103 years-old ([&ge;]56 group) (median =72, n=18570). A cross sectional study of all those diagnosed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between April 1 and May 24 in Argentina was conducted. The data includes clinical and demographic information from all subjects at the time of presentation, which were uploaded to the centralized national reporting system at health centers.Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that out of a total of 23 symptoms, only five were found to have a positive association with COVID-19: anosmia (odds ratio [OR] 10.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.20-13.10, <56 group; OR 6.09 CI 3.05-12.20, [&ge;]56 group), dysgeusia (OR 3.67, CI 2.7-4.9, <56 group; OR 3.53 CI 1.52-8.18, [&ge;]56 group), low grade fever (37.5-37.9 {degrees}C) (OR 1.61, CI 1.20-2.05, <56 group; OR 1.80 CI 1.07-3.06, [&ge;]56 group), cough (OR 1.20, CI 1.05-1.38, <56 group; OR 1.37 CI 1.04-1.80, [&ge;]56 group) and headache only in <56 group (OR 1.71, CI 1.48-1.99).

Implications of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa could be substantial given the limited resources and logistics. This scoping review maps available literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa. Materials and methods Literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa were searched in six databases namely Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Africa Journals Online (AJOL) and CINAHL. Further search was done across websites of the ministries of health of West African countries and notable organisations. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings taking cognisance of the overarching purpose of the study and the research question. Results Of the 67 studies identified, 19 were included in the final synthesis. Three main themes emerged and these are impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers, drivers of susceptibility to COVID-19 and government/donor support. A greater number of the studies originated from Nigeria. Each study reported at least one impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa. The impacts included death, fear, unwillingness to attend to COVID-19 patients and stigmatisation. Some health workers were not adhering to the safety protocols coupled with periodic shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and thereby had an increased susceptibility. Conclusion Being the first scoping review on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa, the study has illustrated the urgent need for West African governments to enact laws/rules that would compel all frontline health workers to adhere to all the COVID-19 protocols at the workplace.

Thus, in order to find potential predictors of a possible second epidemic wave, we analyzed data both from Twitter and from emergency services comparing them to the daily infected time series at a regional level. Since our principal goal is to forecast a possible new ascending phase of the epidemic, we performed a wavelet analysis in the time-frequency plane, to finely discriminate over time the anticipation capability of the considered potential predictors. In addition, a cross-correlation analysis has been performed to find a synthetic indicator of the time delay between the predictor and the infected time series. Our results show that Twitter data are more related to social and political dynamics, while the emergency calls trends can be further evaluated as a powerful tool to potentially forecast a new burden.

Methods: An ongoing prospective, longitudinal, two-centre, observational study was performed in individuals symptomatic after recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Drug treatments were well-tolerated and potent impaired viral replication was observed with all drug treatments. Importantly, both itraconazole-remdesivir and fluoxetine-remdesivir combinations inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles > 90% and displayed synergistic effects in commonly used reference models for drug interaction. Itraconazole-Remdesivir and Fluoxetine-Remdesivir combinations are promising therapeutic options to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe progression of COVID-19.", "pdf_path": null}, "10.1101/2020.10.16.339937": {"rel_title": "Peptide vaccine candidate mimics the heterogeneity of natural SARS-CoV-2 immunity in convalescent humans and induces broad T cell responses in mice models", "rel_abs": "We developed a global peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that addresses the dual challenges of heterogeneity in the immune responses of different individuals and potential heterogeneity of the infecting virus.

Vaccine peptides were selected based on their frequency as HLA class I and class II personal epitopes (PEPIs) restricted to multiple autologous HLA alleles of individuals in an in silico cohort of 433 subjects of different ethnicities. PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 vaccine administered with Montanide ISA 51VG adjuvant generated robust, Th1-biased CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against all four structural proteins of the virus, as well as binding antibodies upon subcutaneous injection into BALB/c and CD34+ transgenic mice. In addition, PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific, polyfunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were detected ex vivo in each of the 17 asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 convalescents' blood investigated, 1-5 months after symptom onset. The PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific T cell repertoire used for recovery from COVID-19 was extremely diverse: donors had an average of seven different peptide-specific T cells, against the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, 87% of donors had multiple targets against at least three SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 53% against all four. In addition, PEPIs determined based on the complete HLA class I genotype of the convalescent donors were validated, with 84% accuracy, to predict PEPI-specific CD8+ T cell responses measured for the individuals. Extrapolation of the above findings to a US bone marrow donor cohort of 16,000 HLA-genotyped individuals with 16 different ethnicities (n=1,000 each ethnic group) suggest that PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 vaccination in a general population will likely elicit broad, multi-antigenic CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses in 98% of individuals, independent of ethnicity, including Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) cohorts.", "pdf_path": null}, "10.1101/2020.10.15.341479": {"rel_title": "Abnormal Antibodies to Self-Carbohydrates in SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients", "rel_abs": "SARS-CoV-2 is a deadly virus that is causing the global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our immune system plays a critical role in preventing, clearing, and treating the virus, but aberrant immune responses can contribute to deleterious symptoms and mortality. Many aspects of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are being investigated, but little is known about immune responses to carbohydrates. Since the surface of the virus is heavily glycosylated, pre-existing antibodies to glycans could potentially recognize the virus and influence disease progression. Furthermore, antibody responses to carbohydrates could be induced, affecting disease severity and clinical outcome. In this study, we used a carbohydrate antigen microarray with over 800 individual components to profile serum anti-glycan antibodies in COVID-19 patients and healthy control subjects. In COVID-19 patients, we observed abnormally high IgG and IgM antibodies to numerous self-glycans, including gangliosides, N-linked glycans, LacNAc-containing glycans, blood group H, and sialyl Lewis X. Some of these anti-glycan antibodies are known to play roles in autoimmune diseases and neurological disorders, which may help explain some of the unusual and prolonged symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients. The detection of antibodies to self-glycans has important implications for using convalescent serum to treat patients, developing safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and understanding the risks of infection.

Several serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 are now becoming available in the market. However, it has also become extremely important to have well-established assays with desirable high sensitivity and specificity. To date, the micro-neutralization (MN) assay, is currently considered the gold-standard being capable of evaluating and detecting, functional neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Several protocols exist for micro-neutralization assays which vary in several steps of the protocol: cell seeding conditions, number of cells seeded, virus amount used in the infection step, virus-serum-cells incubation period etc. These potential differences account for a high degree of variability and inconsistency of the results and using a harmonized protocol for the micro-neutralization assay could potentially solve this. Given this situation, the main aim of our study was to carry out SARS-CoV-2 wild type virus MN assay in order to investigate which optimal tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50) infective dose in use is the most adequate choice for implementation in terms of reproducibility, standardization possibilities and comparability of results. Therefore, we assessed the MN by using two different viral infective doses: a standard dose of 100 TCID50/well and a lower dose of 25 TCID50/well. The results obtained, yielded by MN on using the lower infective dose (25 TCID50), were in line with those obtained with the standard infective dose; in some cases, however, we detected a titre that was one or two dilution steps higher, which maintained all negative samples negative. This suggesting that the lower dose can potentially have a positive impact on the detection and estimation of neutralizing antibodies present in a given sample, showing higher sensitivity but similar specificity and therefore, it would require a more accurate assessment and cross-laboratories standardisation especially when MN is employed as serological assay of choice for pre-clinical and clinical studies.", "pdf_path": null}, "10.1101/2020.10.16.341883": {"rel_title": "The effect of temperature and humidity on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses", "rel_abs": "Since emerging in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic, and it may become an endemic human pathogen.

Ambient temperature and humidity are known to have strong effects on the environmental stability of viruses, but there is little data for SARS-CoV-2, and a general quantitative understanding of how temperature and humidity affect virus stability has remained elusive. Here, we characterise the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on an inert surface at a variety of temperature and humidity conditions, and introduce a mechanistic model that enables accurate prediction of virus stability in unobserved conditions. We find that SARS-CoV-2 survives better at low temperatures and extreme relative humidities; median estimated virus half-life was more than 24 hours at 10 {degrees}C and 40 % RH, but less than an hour and a half at 27 {degrees}C and 65 % RH. Our results highlight scenarios of particular transmission risk, and provide a mechanistic explanation for observed superspreading events in cool indoor environments such as food processing plants.

Here, we present evidence for the transcriptional regulation of SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor ACE2 and co-receptor TMPRSS2 by androgen in mouse tissues and human prostate and lung cell lines. Additionally, we demonstrate the endogenous interaction between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in human cells and validate ACE2 as a TMPRSS2 substrate. In an overexpression model, and the prostate and lung cells, Camostat - a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, blocked the cleavage of pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike without disrupting TMPRSS2-ACE2 interaction. Thus providing evidence for the first time a direct role of TMPRSS2 in priming the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, required for viral fusion to the host cell.

There has been no standardized multi-site social contact study conducted in workplace settings in the United States that can be used to broadly inform pandemic preparedness policy in these settings. Objective: The study aimed to characterize the patterns of social contacts and mixing across workplace environments, including on-site or when teleworking. Design: This was a cross-sectional non-probability survey that used standardized social contact diaries to collect data. Employees were requested to record their physical and non-physical contacts in a diary over two consecutive days, documented at the end of each day. Employees from each company were enrolled through email and electronic diaries sent as individual links. Data were collected from April to June 2020. Setting: Two multinational consulting companies and one university administrative department, all located in Georgia, USA. Participants: Employees opted into the study by accepting the invitation on a link sent via email. Main Outcome: The outcome was median number of contacts per person per day. This was stratified by day of data collection, age, sex, race and ethnicity. Results: Of 3,835 employees approached, 357 (9.3%) completed the first day of contact diary of which 304 completed both days of contact diary. There was a median of 2 contacts (IQR: 1-4, range: 0-21) per respondent on both day one and two.
