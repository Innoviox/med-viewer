About 40% of the patients experienced fever, dry cough, headache, or muscle ache as the first symptom. Fatigue, if reported, usually was the first to appear. Smell and taste changes were experienced 3.9 \u00b1 5.4 and 4.6 \u00b1 5.7 days (mean \u00b1 SD) after disease onset and emerged as first symptom in 15% and 18% of patients, respectively. Fever had the shortest duration (5.8 \u00b1 8.6 days), and taste and smell changes were the longest-lasting symptoms (17.2 \u00b1 17.6 and 18.9 \u00b1 19.7 days, durations censored at 60 days). Longer smell recovery correlated with smell change severity. Cough, taste change and smell change persisted after negative RT-PCR tests (in 20%, 26% and 29% of the patients in total). At six-months follow-up, 46% of the patients had at least one unresolved symptom, most commonly fatigue (21%), chemosensory changes (14%) or breath difficulty (9%).\nConclusions: More than one symptom typically occurred at disease onset. Chemosensory changes and cough persisted after negative RT-PCR in a quarter of the patients. Almost half of the patients reported at least one unresolved symptom at six-months follow up, mainly fatigue, smell changes and breath difficulty.

Red cell agglutination tests have a long history in blood typing, and general serology through linkage of reporter molecules to the red cell surface. They do not require special equipment, are read by eye, have short development times, low cost and can be applied as a Point of Care Test (POCT).

The HAT can be titrated, detects rising titres in the first five days of hospital admission, correlates well with a commercial test that detects antibodies to the RBD, and can be applied as a point of care test. The developing reagent is composed of a previously described nanobody to a conserved glycophorin A epitope on red cells, linked to the RBD from SARS-CoV-2. It can be lyophilised for ease of shipping.

Computed Tomography (CT)-scans can provide demarcating features to identify severity of pneumonia - commonly associated with COVID-19 - in the affected lungs. Here, a quantitative severity assessing chest CT image feature is demonstrated for COVID-19 patients. We incorporated 509 CT images from 101 diagnosed and expert-annotated cases (age 20-90, 60% males) in the study collected from a multi-center Italian database sourced from 41 radio-diagnostic centers. Lesions in the form of opacifications, crazy-paving patterns, and consolidations were segmented. The severity determining feature - L_norm was quantified and established to be statistically distinct for the three - mild, moderate, and severe classes (p-value<0.0001). The thresholds of L_norm for a 3-class classification were determined based on the optimum sensitivity/specificity combination from Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses. The feature L_norm classified the cases in the three severity categories with 86.88% accuracy. `Substantial' to `almost-perfect' intra-rater and inter-rater agreements were achieved involving expert (manual segmentation) and non-expert (graph-cut and deep-learning based segmentation) labels (kappa-score 0.79-0.97). We trained several machine learning classification models and showed L_norm alone has a superior diagnostic accuracy over standard image intensity and texture features. Classification accuracy was further increased when L_norm was used for 2-class classification i.e. to delineate the severe cases from non-severe ones with a high sensitivity (97.7%), and specificity (97.49%).

Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the pathophysiology of CRF. Using a comprehensive group of physiological and psychosocial variables, the aim of the present study was to identify correlates of CRF in a heterogenous group of cancer survivors. Ninety-three cancer survivors (51 fatigued, 42 non-fatigued, with grouping based on validated cut-off scores derived from The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue scale) completed assessments of performance fatigability (i.e. the change in maximal force-generating capacity, contractile function and capacity of the central nervous system to activate muscles caused by cycling exercise), cardiopulmonary exercise testing, venous blood samples for whole blood cell count and inflammatory markers and body composition. Participants also completed questionnaires measuring demographic, treatment-related, and psychosocial variables. The results showed that performance fatigability (decline in muscle strength during exercise), time-to-task-failure, peak oxygen uptake (V\u0307O2peak), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), body fat percentage and lean mass index were associated with CRF severity. Performance fatigability, V\u0307O2peak, TNF-\u03b1 and age explained 35% of the variance in CRF severity. Furthermore, those with clinically-relevant CRF reported more pain, more depressive symptoms, less social support, and were less physically active than non-fatigued cancer survivors.

In this study, we examined whether polygenic scores (PGS) for AN and obesity are associated, individually or combined, with a range of anthropometric trajectories spanning the first two decades of life. Methods: AN-PGS and obesity-PGS were calculated for participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; N= 8,654 participants with genotype data and at least one outcome measure). Using generalized (mixed) linear models, we associated PGS with trajectories of weight, height, body mass index (BMI), fat mass index (FMI), lean mass index (LMI), and bone mineral density (BMD). Growth trajectories were derived using spline modeling or mixed effects modeling. Results: Between age 5-24 years, Females with one SD higher AN-PGS had on average a 0.01% lower BMI trajectory, and between age 10-24 years a 0.01% lower FMI trajectory and 0.05% lower weight trajectory. Higher obesity-PGS was associated with higher BMI, FMI, LMI, BMD, weight, and lower height trajectories in both sexes. The average growth trajectories of females with high AN-PGS/low obesity-PGS remained consistently lower than those with low AN-PGS/low obesity-PGS; this difference did not reach statistical significance. However, post-hoc comparisons suggest that females with high AN-PGS/low obesity-PGS did follow lower growth trajectories compared to those with high PGS for both traits.

Implications of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa could be substantial given the limited resources and logistics. This scoping review maps available literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa.\nMaterials and methods\nLiterature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa were searched in six databases namely Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Africa Journals Online (AJOL) and CINAHL. Further search was done across websites of the ministries of health of West African countries and notable organisations. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings taking cognisance of the overarching purpose of the study and the research question.\nResults\nOf the 67 studies identified, 19 were included in the final synthesis. Three main themes emerged and these are impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers, drivers of susceptibility to COVID-19 and government/donor support. A greater number of the studies originated from Nigeria. Each study reported at least one impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa. The impacts included death, fear, unwillingness to attend to COVID-19 patients and stigmatisation. Some health workers were not adhering to the safety protocols coupled with periodic shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and thereby had an increased susceptibility.\nConclusion\nBeing the first scoping review on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa, the study has illustrated the urgent need for West African governments to enact laws/rules that would compel all frontline health workers to adhere to all the COVID-19 protocols at the workplace. To end intermittent shortage or issue of inadequate PPEs, governments ought to liaise with local industries by empowering them, providing financial support and creating a conducive atmosphere for them to produce cost effective PPEs using available local resources.", "filename": "2020.10.15.20213249v1", "doi": "doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.15.20213249 "}, {"title": "Microscale dynamics of electrophysiological markers of epilepsy", "abstract": "Objective: \nInterictal discharges (IIDs) and high frequency oscillations (HFOs) are neurophysiologic biomarkers of epilepsy.

For IIDs, putative spatiotemporal paths were generated by peak-tracking, followed by clustering. For HFOs, repeating patterns were elucidated by clustering similar time windows. Fast events, consistent with multi-unit activity (MUA), were covaried with either IIDs or HFOs.\n\nResults:\nIIDs seen across the entire array were detected in 93% of subjects. Local IIDs, observed across <50% of the array, were seen in 53% of subjects. IIDs appeared to travel across the array in specific paths, and HFOs appeared in similar repeated spatial patterns.

Therefore, it is important to develop methods that will ensure that the COVID vaccine is allocated to the people who are at major risk until there is a sufficient global supply. Herein, I developed a machine-learning tool that could be applied to assess the risk in communities based on social, medical, and lifestyle risk factors. As a proof of concept, I modeled COVID risk in the Massachusetts communities using 29 risk factors, including the prevalence of preexisting comorbid conditions like COPD and social factors such as racial composition. Of the 29 factors, 14 were found to be significant (p < 0.1) indicators: poverty, food insecurity, lack of high school education, lack of health insurance coverage, premature mortality, population, population density, recent population growth, Asian percentage, high-occupancy housing, and preexisting prevalence of cancer, COPD, overweightness, and heart attacks. The machine-learning approach finds the 9 highest risk communities in the state of Massachusetts: Lynn, Brockton, Revere, Randolph, Lowell, New Bedford, Everett, Waltham, and Fitchburg. The 5 most at-risk counties are Suffolk, Middlesex, Bristol, Norfolk, and Plymouth.

Interestingly, cross-protective effects of vaccination against heterologous infections have been reported, and long-term boosting of innate immunity (also termed trained immunity) has been proposed as the underlying mechanism. Several epidemiological studies also suggested cross-protection between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 during the current pandemic.  However, the mechanism behind such an effect is unknown. Using an established in-vitro model of trained immunity, we demonstrate that the quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine used in the Netherlands in the 2019-2020 influenza season can induce a trained immunity response, including an improvement of cytokine responses after stimulation of human immune cells with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was less common among Dutch hospital employees who had received influenza vaccination during the 2019/2020 winter season (RR = 0,61 (95% CI, 0.4585 - 0.8195, P = 0.001). In conclusion, a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine can induce trained immunity responses against SARS-CoV-2, which may result in relative protection against COVID-19.

To test our hypothesis, we collected serum samples from 31 patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms at the time of their admission. After standard therapy without corticosteroids, 9 of the 31 patients developed severe COVID-19 symptoms. We analyzed EV protein and exRNA profiles to look for correlations between these profiles and COVID-19 severity. Strikingly, we identified three distinct groups of markers (antiviral response-related EV proteins, coagulation-related markers, and liver damage-related exRNAs) with the potential to serve as early predictive biomarkers for COVID-19 severity. Among these markers, EV COPB2 has the best predictive value for severe deterioration of COVID-19 patients in this cohort.

Research has focused on short-term outcomes in hospital, and single organ involvement. Consequently, impact of long COVID (persistent symptoms three months post-infection) across multiple organs in low-risk individuals is yet to be assessed.\n\nMethods: An ongoing prospective, longitudinal, two-centre, observational study was performed in individuals symptomatic after recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms and organ function (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) were assessed by standardised questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Dyspnoea-12), blood investigations and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, defining single and multi-organ impairment by consensus definitions.  \n\nFindings: Between April and September 2020, 201 individuals (mean age 44 (SD 11.0) years, 70% female, 87% white, 31% healthcare workers) completed assessments following SARS-CoV-2 infection (median 140, IQR 105-160 days after initial symptoms). The prevalence of pre-existing conditions (obesity: 20%, hypertension: 6%; diabetes: 2%; heart disease: 4%) was low, and only 18% of individuals had been hospitalised with COVID-19. Fatigue (98%), muscle aches (88%), breathlessness (87%), and headaches (83%) were the most frequently reported symptoms.

The data that we used in this study is the mRNA expression data obtained from the corresponding clinical information and the Tumor Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. And the goal we used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was to evaluate the difference in the expression of m6A RNA methylation regulators in the normal group and the tumor group, and analyze the correlation between m6A RNA methylation regulators. We identified two subgroups of BRCA (cluster1 and 2) by using the K-mean algorithm and analyzing the correlation between clinic information and subgroups. The LASSO regression model then was used to figure out three m6A RNA methylation regulators, namely YTHDF3, ZC3H13, and HNRNPC. The riskScore of each patient was calculated according to the regression coefficients of the three m6A RNA methylation regulators. Base on the riskScore, we divided the patients into two groups, the high-risk group, and the low-risk group. After analyzing, we found that the overall survival rate (OS) of the low-risk group was higher than that of the other group. We conducted a univariate and multi-factor independent prognostic analysis of riskScore and three m6A RNA methylation regulators, and found that riskScore has a significant correlation with BRCA.

The potential for environmental toxicants such as PBDEs to disrupt normal neuroendocrine pathways resulting in depression and other neurological symptoms has been largely understudied. This study examined whether PBDE exposure in pregnant women was associated with antenatal depressive symptomatology.\nMethods: This study is part of a larger longitudinal pregnancy and birth cohort study. Data were collected from 193 African American pregnant women at 8-14 weeks gestation. Serum PBDEs were analyzed using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) was used to identify depressive symptoms experienced in the last seven days prior to biosampling. The dichotomous depression variable was used to explore varying high-risk EDS cutoffs and illustrated with receiver operating characteristic curves. Logistic regression models were constructed to investigate associations with antenatal depression and a weighted quantile sum (WQS) index was calculated to account for the mixture of PBDE congeners.\nResults: Of the total sample, 52 women (26.9%) were categorized as having a high risk of depression. PBDE congeners -47, -99, and -100 were detected in 50% or more of the samples tested. BDE-47 was positively associated with depressive symptoms (\u03b2 =2.36, p=0.05). The risk of being mild to moderately depressed increased by a factor of 4.52 for BDE-47 (CI 1.50, 13.60) and 1.58 for BDE-99 (CI 1.08, 2.29). The WQS index, a weighted estimate of the body burden of the congener mixture was positively associated with a higher risk of mild to moderate depression using an EDS cutoff \u226510 (OR=2.93; CI 1.18, 7.82).\nConclusion: BDE-47 and -99 exposures are significantly associated with depressive symptomatology in a pregnant cohort.

However, there is limited information regarding the set of specific symptoms of COVID-19. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the main symptoms associated with COVID-19 to aid in the clinical diagnosis for the rapid identification of cases.\nMethods and findings\nA cross sectional study of all those diagnosed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between April 1 and May 24 in Argentina was conducted. The data includes clinical and demographic information from all subjects at the time of presentation, which were uploaded to the centralized national reporting system at health centers. A total of 67318 individuals were included in this study, where 12% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The study population was divided in two age groups, a group aged 0 to 55 years-old (<56 group), (median = 32, n=48748) and another group aged 56 to 103 years-old (\u226556 group) (median =72, n=18570). A cross sectional study of all those diagnosed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between April 1 and May 24 in Argentina was conducted. The data includes clinical and demographic information from all subjects at the time of presentation, which were uploaded to the centralized national reporting system at health centers.Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that out of a total of 23 symptoms, only five were found to have a positive association with COVID-19: anosmia (odds ratio [OR] 10.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.20-13.10, <56 group; OR 6.09 CI 3.05-12.20, \u226556 group), dysgeusia (OR 3.67, CI 2.7-4.9, <56 group; OR 3.53 CI 1.52-8.18, \u226556 group), low grade fever (37.5-37.9 \u00b0C) (OR 1.61, CI 1.20-2.05, <56 group; OR 1.80 CI 1.07-3.06, \u226556 group), cough (OR 1.20, CI 1.05-1.38, <56 group; OR 1.37 CI 1.04-1.80, \u226556 group) and headache only in <56 group (OR 1.71, CI 1.48-1.99). In turn, at the time of presentation, the symptoms associated with respiratory problems: chest pain, tachypnea, dyspnea, respiratory failure and use of accessory muscles for breathing, had a negative association with COVID-19 (OR <1) or did not present statistical relevance (OR = 1).\nWith the intention of helping the clinical diagnosis, we designed a model to be able to identify possible cases of COVID-19. This model included 16 symptoms, the age and sex of the individuals, and was able to detect 80% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 with a specificity of 46%.\nConclusions\nThe analysis of symptoms opens the opportunity for a guidance and improved symptoms based definition of suspected cases of COVID-19, where multiple factors (age, sex, symptoms and interaction between symptoms) are considered.

Also, the role of these markers in governing virus specific immunity following infection remains largely unexplored.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of systemic and gut inflammatory markers in disease progression and development of anti-viral humoral immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nDESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study (n=58) of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals included a group of in-patients (n=36) at various stages of disease progression together with convalescent individuals (n=22) recruited between April and June 2020 (peak of the epidemic) from a tertiary care hospital in Mumbai, India. Follow-up of 11 in-patients at day 7 post diagnosis was carried out, resulting in a total of 47 in-patient samples.\nEXPOSURES: Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based testing of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the measurement of inflammatory markers including Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines and levels of soluble mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (sMAdCAM) in plasma. Anti-viral humoral response was measured by rapid antibody test (IgG, IgM) and chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) (IgG). Also antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Secondary outcomes were correlation of the inflammatory signature with clinical information, including age, sex, disease duration and co-morbidities. \nRESULTS: Twenty eight of 36 (78%) in-patients and 19 of 22 (86%) convalescents were males. Out of 47 in-patient samples, 22 (46%), 11 (23%) and 14 (30%) were IgG-/IgM-, IgG+/IgM+ and IgG+/IgM- respectively. Of 22 convalescent samples, 3 (14%), 1 (4%) and 17 (77%) were respectively IgG-/IgM-, IgG+/IgM+ and IgG+/IgM-. Two out of 22 (9%) convalescents showed high IL-6 levels (>100pg/ml) and 4 (18%) had high TNF levels (>30pg/ml). However, the convalescents (n =22) had significantly lower levels of IL-6 [Median=27.48 (IQR=23.54-39.92)]  compared to followed up in-patients (n = 11) at day 0 [Median=111(IQR=68-129.7), p =0.0002] and higher levels of sMAdCAM [Median=1940 (1711-2174) pg/ml] compared to these individuals at day 0 [Median=1701 (IQR=1532-1836) pg/ml; p=0.032]  and day 7 [Median=1534 (IQR=1236-1654) pg/ml; p=0.0007]. Further, IL-6 and sMAdCAM levels among in-patients inversely correlated with one another (r =-0.374, p = 0.009, CI = 95%). When expressed as a novel integrated marker, sMIL (sMAdCAM/IL-6 ratio) index, these levels were incrementally and significantly higher across various disease states with convalescents exhibiting the highest values [Median= 64.74 (IQR=47.33-85.58)].  Also, the sMIL index was significantly higher in convalescents (with class-switched responses) compared to IgG+/IgM+ individuals at early stages of infection [Median=28.65 (IQR=13.63-96.26), p = 0.034]. Real-time measurement by SPR of plasma antibody binding to viral nucleocapsid (NC), receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike (S) revealed waxing and waning of plasma antibody responses to all 3 targets. Importantly, sMAdCAM levels as well as sMIL index (fold change) correlated with peak association rates of RBD-binding (r = 0.462, p = 0.03, CI = 95%) and fold change in binding to S (r = 0.68, p = 0.050, CI = 95%) respectively.\nCONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our results highlight key systemic and gut-associated immune parameters that need to be monitored and investigated further to optimally guide therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for COVID-19.", "filename": "2020.10.13.20182949v1", "doi": "doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.13.20182949 "}, {"title": "Quantitative assessment on the severity degree of Alzheimer dementia by algebraic analysis on cortical thickness profiles of human brains", "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) affects profoundly the quality of human life.

We evaluate this framework in two common PET study designs: a cross-sectional (e.g., patient-control comparison) and a paired-sample design (e.g., pre-intervention-post scan comparison). By using simulations, we show that it is possible to stop a clinical PET study early, both when there is an effect and when there is no effect, while keeping the number of erroneous conclusions at acceptable levels. Based on the results we recommend settings for a sequential design that are appropriate for commonly seen sample sizes in clinical PET-studies.

Leveraging rich Swedish register data, we connect all students and teachers in Sweden to their families and study the impact of moving to online instruction on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We find that among parents, exposure to open rather than closed schools resulted in a small increase in PCR-confirmed infections [OR 1.15; CI95 1.03-1.27].

In this model, fast increases to the peak are often followed by plateaus, shoulders, and lag-driven oscillations.

Here we show how a simple Susceptible-Infective-Recovered (SIR) model applied to data for eight European countries and the United Kingdom (UK) can be used to forecast the descending limb (post-peak) of confirmed cases and deaths as a function of time, and predict the duration of the pandemic once it has peaked, by estimating and fixing parameters using only characteristics of the ascending limb and the magnitude of the first peak. As with all epidemiological analyses, unanticipated behavioral changes will result in deviations between projection and observation. This is abundantly clear for the current pandemic.  Nonetheless, accurate short-term projections are possible, and the methodology we present is a useful addition to the epidemiologist's armamentarium. Since our predictions assume that control measures such as lockdown, social distancing, use of masks etc. remain the same post-peak as before peak, deviations from our predictions are a measure of the extent to which loosening of control measures have impacted case-loads and deaths since the first peak and initial decline in daily cases and deaths. The predicted and actual case fatality ratio,  or number of deaths per million population from the start of the pandemic to when daily deaths number less than five for the first time, was lowest in Norway (pred: 44 +/- 5 deaths/million; actual: 36 deaths/million) and highest for the United Kingdom (pred: 578 +/- 65 deaths/million; actual 621 deaths/million). The inferred pandemic characteristics separated into two distinct groups: those that are largely invariant across countries, and those that are highly variable.

The probability of mortality rather than recovery was a significant correlate of the duration of the pandemic, defined as the time from 12/31/2019 to when the number of daily deaths fell below 5.

In order to avoid excessive restriction to the social activity, a good strategy of quarantine based on a realistic model is expected. Several epidemic models with a quarantine compartment such as susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) model have been applied. However, in the actual situation, the infection test and quarantine is often delayed from the beginning of the infectious stage. \n  This article presents a delayed SEIQR model to analyze the effect of the delay of quarantine. The latency period (compartment E) and the incubation period were assumed to be 3 days and 5 days, respectively. Considering that the presymptomatic infection ratio is 0.4, the natural decay rate of the number of infectious patients was assumed to be 0.25 days-1. The recovery rate was assumed to be 0.07 days-1 from the typical PCR test positive period. The PCR test positive number in the period from March 10 to July 18 in 2020 in Tokyo area was analyzed. The delay time distribution of the quarantine was derived from the record of the symptom onset date, and was utilized to determine the delay time profile of quarantine in the model.\n  It was found that the major contributor to the infection control was the restraint of social contact. However, the quarantine action also contributed to reducing the reproduction number by the ratio of 0.88 and 0.8 in the period from March 10 to June 3 and from June 4 to July 18, respectively. The delay of quarantine was found to be well correlated to the effectiveness of quarantine. Therefore a record on a symptom onset date is very important to estimate the effect of quarantine measure. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.56. In view of the presymptomatic infection ratio 0.4, it would be very hard to restrain the expansion of infection only by quarantining the symptomatic patients.", "filename": "2020.08.18.20177709v4", "doi": "doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177709 "}, {"title": "INFERRED RESOLUTION THROUGH HERD IMMMUNITY OF FIRST COVID-19 WAVE IN MANAUS, BRAZILIAN AMAZON", "abstract": "Background\n\nAs in many other settings, peak excess mortality preceded the officially reported 'first wave' peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Manaus, Brazil, reflecting delayed case recognition and limited initial access to diagnostic testing. \n\nMethods and Findings\n\nTo avoid early information bias, we used detailed age and gender stratified death certificate and hospitalisation data to evaluate the epidemic's trajectory and infer the cause of its decline using a stochastic model. Our results are consistent with heterogenous transmission reducing from mid-April 2020 due to the development of herd immunity. Relative to a baseline model that assumed homogenous mixing across Manaus, a model that permitted a self-isolated population fraction reduced the population-wide attack rate required to drop the effective reproduction number below one from 62% to 47%, and reduced the final attack rate from 86% to 65%. In the latter scenario, a substantial proportion of vulnerable, older individuals remained susceptible to infection.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur models indicate that the development of herd immunity amongst the mixing proportion of the Manaus population had effectively halted the COVID-19 epidemic by late July 2020.

As of yet, there is no clinically automated tool to quantify the infection of COVID-19 patients, which is of great significance for judging the disease development and treatment response of patients. Automatic segmentation of lung opacification from computed tomography (CT) images shows excellent potential for this purpose but still faces some challenges, including the complexity and variability features of the opacity regions, the small difference between the infected and healthy tissues, and the noise of CT images. However, due to limited medical resources, it is impractical to obtain a large amount of data in a short time, which further hinders the training of deep learning models. To answer these challenges, we proposed a novel spatial- and channel-wise coarse-to-fine attention network (SCOAT-Net), inspired by the biological vision mechanism, for the segmentation of COVID-19 lung opacification from CT images. SCOAT-Net has a spatial-wise attention module and a channel-wise attention module to attract the self-attention learning of the network, which serves to extract the practical features at the pixel and channel level successfully.

Here, we developed a comprehensive dataset of respiratory viral loads (rVLs) via systematic review and investigated these factors using meta-analyses and modeling. By comparing cases of COVID-19, SARS and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, we found that heterogeneity in rVL was associated with overdispersion and facilitated the distinctions in individual variation in infectiousness among these emergent diseases. For COVID-19, case heterogeneity was broad throughout the infectious period, although rVL tended to peak at 1 day from symptom onset (DFSO) and be elevated for 1-5 DFSO. While most cases presented minimal risk, highly infectious ones could spread SARS-CoV-2 by talking, singing or breathing, which shed virions at comparable rates via droplets and aerosols. Coughing shed considerable quantities of virions, predominantly via droplets, and greatly increased the contagiousness of many symptomatic cases relative to asymptomatic ones. Asymptomatic and symptomatic infections showed similar likelihoods of expelling aerosols with SARS-CoV-2, as did adult and pediatric cases.

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with increased wound infection, prolonged hospital stay and death after major surgery. Although there are many risk assessment methods available which are used to assess risk of cardiac operative mortality and morbidity but they have some limitations. Hence, preoperative serum albumin level can be utilized to upgrade risk models which will further benefit the cardiac surgical patients without extra financial burden.\nObjective: To evaluate the role of serum albumin as a predictor of morbidity and mortality after valve replacement surgery.\nMaterials and Methods: This comparative cross-sectional study was carried out at the department of cardiac surgery in BSMMU. The study population was 50, with two groups having 25 patients each. Grouping of patients were done with respect to a preset cut off value for serum albumin. The period of study was from August, 2018 to February, 2020 and purposive sampling method was applied for this study. Data was collected by using a standardized semi-structured questionnaire and face to face interview.\nResults: In comparison to demographic characteristics, mean age in group A and B were 41.6011.16 years & 49.96\u00b18.69 years respectively, which was found statistically significant (p=0.005). Gender distribution was insignificant but BMI was found statistically significant in between groups (p<0.05). Difference in terms of preoperative risk factors and investigations, no statistical significance found in between groups. Comparison of peroperative variables were also found statistically insignificant. In terms of postoperative outcome, total chest drain collection was higher in group B (968.80\u00b1183.49 ml) than group A (816.00\u00b1113.40 ml), which was statistically significant (p=0.001). Similarly, duration of ICU stay and hospital stay were longer in group B (4.60\u00b10.76 days & 9.88\u00b11.56 days respectively) than group A (3.92\u00b10.86 days & 8.64\u00b10.81 days respectively), which were found statistically significant (p=0.005 & p=0.001 respectively). Among postoperative complications wound infection was found much more in group B (16%) compared to group A (4%), but that was not found to be statistically significant (p>0.05). In comparison to overall morbidity and mortality, higher morbidity was seen in group B (48%) compared to group A (20%), which was found statistically significant (p<0.05), but difference in terms of mortality was not found statistically significant, though it was higher in group B (12% compared to 4%). Pearson co-efficient correlation test showed strong inverse relationship of serum albumin with total chest drain, ICU stay and hospital stay following valve replacement surgery (r= -0.473, r= -0.448 & r= -0.487 respectively), which was most significant than age and BMI (p\u22640.001).

However, manual EEG mark-up is a time-consuming, subjective, and highly specialized task where the human reviewer needs to visually inspect a large amount of data to facilitate accurate clinical decisions. The objective of this study was to develop a framework for automated detection of generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA),  which is a characteristic type of generalized IED seen in scalp EEG recordings of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a severe form of drug-resistant generalized epilepsy.\nMethods: We studied 13 children with LGS who had GPFA events in their interictal EEG recordings. Time-frequency information derived from manually marked IEDs across multiple EEG channels was used to automatically detect similar events in each patient's interictal EEG. We validated true positives and false positives of the proposed spike detection approach using both standalone scalp EEG and simultaneous EEG-functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) recordings.\nResults: GPFA events displayed a consistent low-high frequency arrangement in the time-frequency domain. This bimodal spectral feature was most prominent over frontal EEG channels. Our automatic detection approach using this feature identified likely epileptic events with similar time-frequency properties to the manually marked GPFAs. Brain maps of EEG-fMRI signal change during these automatically detected IEDs were comparable to the EEG-fMRI brain maps derived from manual IED markup. \nConclusion: GPFA events have a characteristic bimodal time-frequency feature that can be automatically detected from scalp EEG recordings in patients with LGS. Validity of this time-frequency feature is demonstrated by EEG-fMRI analysis of automatically detected events, which recapitulates the brain maps we have previously shown to underlie generalized IEDs in LGS.  \nSignificance: This study provides a novel methodology that paves the way for quick, automated, and objective inspection of generalized IEDs in LGS. The proposed framework may be extendable to a wider range of epilepsy syndromes in which monitoring the burden of epileptic activity can aid clinical decision-making. For example, automated quantification of generalized discharges may permit faster assessment of treatment response and estimation of future seizure risk.", "filename": "2019.12.28.19016089v3", "doi": "doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.28.19016089 "}, {"title": "Quantifying the Effects of Social Distancing on the Spread of COVID-19", "abstract": "This paper studies the interplay between the social distancing and the spread of COVID-19 disease, a widely spread pandemic that has affected nearly most of the world population. Starting in China, the virus has reached the  United  States of America with devastating consequences. Other countries severely affected by the pandemic are Brazil, Russia, United Kingdom, Spain, India, Italy, and France. Even though it is not possible to eliminate the spread of the virus from the world or any other country, it might be possible to reduce its effect by decreasing the number of infected people. Implementing such policies needs a good understanding of the system dynamics, generally not possible with mathematical linear equations or Monte Carlo methods because human society is a complex adaptive system with complex and continuous feedback loops. As a result, we use agent-based methods to conduct our study. Moreover, recent agent-based modeling studies for the COVID-19 pandemic show significant promise assisting decision-makers in managing the crisis through applying some policies such as social distancing, disease testing, contact tracing, home isolation,  providing good emergency and hospitalization strategies, and preventing traveling would lead to reducing the infection rates. Based on imperial college modeling studies that prove increasing levels of interventions could slow down the spread of disease and infection cases as much as possible,  and taking into account that social distancing policy is considered to be the most important factor that was recommended to follow. Our proposed model is designed to test if increasing the social distancing policies strictness can slow down the spread of disease significantly or not, and find out what is the required safe level of social distancing. So, the model was run six times, with six different percentages of social distancing with keeping the other parameters levels fixed for all experiments. The results of our study show that social distancing affects the spread of  COVID-19  significantly, where the spread of disease and infection rates decrease once social distancing procedures are implemented at higher levels. Also, the behavior space tool was used to run ten experiments with different levels of social distancing, which supported the previous results. We concluded that applying and increasing social distancing policy levels led to significantly reduced infection rates, which result in decreasing deaths. Both types of experiments prove that infection rates are reduced dramatically when the level of social distancing intervention is implemented between 80% to 100%.", "filename": "2020.09.19.20197996v3", "doi": "doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.19.20197996 "}, {"title": "Novel SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody and neutralization assays reveal wide range of humoral immune response during COVID-19", "abstract": "Development of antibody protection during SARS-CoV-2 infection is a pressing question for public health and for vaccine development.

Therefore, in the present paper, we developed a spatial statistical approach to describe how COVID-19 cases are spatially distributed and to identify significant spatial clusters of cases and how  socioeconomic and climatic features of Iranian provinces might predict the number of cases. The analyses are applied to cumulative cases of the disease from February 19th to March 18th. They correspond to obtaining maps associated with quartiles for rates of COVID-19 cases smoothed through a Bayesian technique and relative risks, the calculation of global (Moran's I) and local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA), both univariate and bivariate, to derive significant clustering, and the fit of a multivariate spatial lag model considering a set of variables potentially affecting the presence of the disease.  We identified a cluster of provinces with significantly higher rates of COVID-19 cases around Tehran (p-value< 0.05), indicating that the COVID-19 spread within Iran was spatially correlated. Urbanized, highly connected provinces with older population structures and higher average temperatures were the most susceptible to present a higher number of COVID-19 cases (p-value < 0.05). Interestingly, literacy is a factor that is associated with a decrease in the number of cases (p-value < 0.05), which might be directly related to health literacy and compliance with public health measures.  These features indicate that social distancing, protecting older adults, and vulnerable populations, as well as promoting health literacy, might be useful to reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread in Iran. One limitation of our analysis is that the most updated information we found concerning socioeconomic and climatic features is not for 2020, or even for a same year, so that the obtained associations should be interpreted with caution.

We assessed data as of September 1, 2020 from our combined laboratories and as reported for selected states and countries for case, death, and testing rates per 1 million in the population. Our goal was to elucidate potential causes for the large rate differences observed. SARS-CoV-2 naso-pharyngeal (NP) RNA swab testing in 985,219 US subjects referred to our laboratories by healthcare providers revealed an overall 10.1% positive rate, comparable to the 7.3% rate reported nationwide. In a small subset of 91 subjects, all of whom had been positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in NP swabs 2-4 weeks earlier, NP swab testing was twice as likely to be positive (58.6%) as saliva samples (21.5%), based on paired sampling. Our positive rates per state agreed reasonably well with reported Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data (r=0.609, P<0.0001) based on 19,898 cases, 593 deaths, and 271,637 tests, all per 1 million in the US population. Louisiana had the highest case rate; New Jersey had the highest death rate; and Rhode Island had the highest testing rate. Of 47 countries, including all countries with populations >50 million, Qatar had the highest case rate; Peru had the highest death rate; and Israel had the highest testing rate for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Correlations between case rates and death rates as well as testing rates were 0.473 and 0.398 for US states and 0.473 and 0.476 for the various countries, respectively (all P<0.0001).

Nearly 5% of medication errors can be attributable to abbreviation use. Prescriptions need to be clear so that nurses and pharmacists can correctly interpret intentions of doctors. For patient safety, hospitals should implement a process for uniform use of approved abbreviations, such as through use of an approved list or never-use list of abbreviations and symbols.

A stochastic extension of the deterministic model is further considered to capture the uncertainty or variation observed in the disease transmissibility. In the case of a deterministic system, the disease-free equilibrium will be globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, otherwise, the disease persists. Using Lyapunov functional methods, we prove that the infected population of the stochastic system tends to zero exponentially almost surely if the basic reproduction number is less than unity. The stochastic system has no interior equilibrium, however, its asymptotic solution is shown to fluctuate around the endemic equilibrium of the deterministic system under some parametric restrictions, implying that the infection persists.

Therefore, the purposes of this study were: 1) objectively characterize changes in knee laxity due to TKA, 2) objectively determine whether TKA resulted in equal amounts of varus-valgus motion under a given load (i.e., balance) and 3) determine how TKA knee laxity and balance differ from values seen in non-osteoarthritic knees.\nMethods:Two surgeons used a custom navigation system and intra-operative device to record varus-valgus motion under quantified loads in a cohort of 31 patients (34 knees ) undergoing primary TKA. Similar data previously were collected from a cohort of 42 native cadaveric knees.\nResults: Performing a TKA resulted in a \"looser knee\" on average, but great variability existed within and between surgeons.
