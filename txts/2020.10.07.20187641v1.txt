  19     Abstract
  20     Serological testing in the COVID-19 pandemic is mainly implemented to gain sero-epidemiological
  21     data, but can also retrospectively inform about suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We verified and
  22     applied a two-tiered testing strategy combining a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-
  23     specific lateral flow assay (LFA) with a nucleocapsid protein (NCP) IgG ELISA to assess seroconversion
  24     in n=7241 individuals. The majority had experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but had
  25     no access to RT-PCR testing. Longitudinal follow-up in n=97 LFA+ individuals was performed up to 20
  26     weeks after initial infection using NCP and spike protein S1 domain (S1) IgG ELISAs and a surrogate
  27     virus neutralization test (sVNT). Individuals reporting symptoms from January 2020 onwards showed
  28     seroconversion, as did a considerable proportion of asymptomatic individuals. Seroconversion for
  29     symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals was higher in an area with a known infection cluster
  30     compared to a low incidence area. Overall, 94% of individuals with a positive IgG result by LFA were
  31     confirmed by NCP ELISA. The proportion of ELISA-confirmed LFA results declined over time, in line
  32     with contracting NCP IgG titers during longitudinal follow-up. Neutralizing antibody activity was
  33     considerably more stable than S1 and NCP IgG titers, and both reach a plateau after approximately
  34     100 days. The sVNT proved to be not only highly specific, but also more sensitive than the specificity-
  35     focussed two-tiered serology approach. Our results demonstrate the high specificity of two-tiered
  36     serology testing and highlight the sVNT used as a valuable tool to support modelling of SARS-CoV-2
  37     transmission dynamics, complement molecular testing and provide relevant information to
  38     individuals.

  42     Introduction
  43     The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus
  44     disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has led to millions of infections with substantial morbidity and
  45     mortality [1]. COVID-19 is characterized by a range of symptoms including cough, fever, pneumonia
  46     and a characteristic loss of smell and taste [2, 3]. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 differ
  47     considerably and range from asymptomatic or mild self-limiting disease to severe disease and death.
  48     Next to co-morbidities predisposing to severe disease, immune hyperresponsiveness appears to be a
  49     critical factor driving COVID-19 disease severity [4, 5].
  50     In the Netherlands, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 started in the Southern provinces, likely exacerbated
  51     by regional carnival celebrations following travel to and from Northern Italy during the school
  52     holidays [6, 7]. However, due to limited capacity at the time RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was
  53     largely restricted to hospitalized patients with suspected COVID-19 and symptomatic individuals
  54     with moderate disease that had a recent travel history to high risk areas such as Northern Italy. Even
  55     household members of RT-PCR positive individuals were advised to self-isolate but not tested.
  56     Therefore, a large number of symptomatic individuals in The Netherlands were not tested for SARS-
  57     CoV-2 up until the start of July 2020, which left many affected individuals uncertain about whether
  58     or not their symptoms were due to COVID-19. Serological testing offers a possibility to abolish this
  59     uncertainty. In an early study, it was shown that seroconversion for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM
  60     occurred simultaneously or sequentially within 19 days of infection in all symptomatic COVID-19
  61     patients analyzed [8]. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of coronaviruses is a
  62     particularly interesting target for serological testing since it is the target of neutralizing antibodies [9-
  63     11], and serology tests based on the detection of these antibodies are being evaluated as indicators
  64     of protective immunity.
  65     A crucial requirement when offering individualized serological testing, however, is a very high
  66     specificity of the test(s) selected to avoid false positives. At the early stage of the pandemic, the risk
  67     and benefit of serological tests and in particular rapid tests such as lateral flow assays (LFAs) was
  68     heavily debated [12]. Next to concerns about the performance of such rapid tests, another worry
  69     was poor registration and potential misinterpretation of the results of these tests outside controlled
  70     laboratory settings [13].
  71     Following careful verification of a range of CE-marked serological test, Innatoss started in April 2020
  72     to offer testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a mobile lab setting using finger prick blood. LFA results
  73     were interpreted by trained staff and applied in the context of a two-tiered testing strategy to
  74     maximize specificity. This testing strategy combined an RBD-directed LFA with strong performance
                                                                                                                                  3

  75     characteristics [14] with a highly specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NCP) IgG ELISA for
  76     confirmation in follow-up serum samples. This dual test approach is in line with the recommended
  77     common practice for serologic testing of Lyme Borreliosis, which also serves to enhance specificity
  78     [15]. Pre-screening with an LFA reduces pressure on the general health care system since it abolishes
  79     the need for venous blood collection, which is then only necessary for LFA positive individuals for
  80     confirmatory ELISA.
  81     Here, we report the verification, performance and outcomes of this two-tiered serological testing
  82     strategy applied in n=7241 individuals from mid-April to mid-August in The Netherlands. The
  83     majority of these individuals had experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19 at least 4 weeks
  84     prior to testing. Our results demonstrate the high specificity and feasibility of this testing approach
  85     even in times of strict anti-COVID-19 lock-down measures. We further described the kinetics of anti-
  86     SARS-CoV-2 NCP and spike protein domain 1 (S1) IgG levels as well neutralizing antibodies measured
  87     using a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) [16] in a subgroup of individuals that underwent
  88     diagnostic follow-up up to 20 weeks after initial infection. These data demonstrate that neutralizing
  89     antibodies are highly stable in the time frame analyzed and that the sVNT used provides not only a
  90     very specific but also highly sensitive and scalable assay to follow-up seroconverted individuals to
  91     determine functional antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.

  92     Materials and methods
  93     Sample collection
  94     All blood/serum samples and data reported in this article were submitted to Innatoss for diagnostic
  95     purposes. All individuals whose data are reported in this article provided written consent to the use
  96     of pseudonymized test outcomes and of surplus serum samples for additional analyses. The Medisch
  97     Ethische Toetsingscommissie Brabant, Tilburg, The Netherlands has waived the need for IRB
  98     approval of reuse of surplus diagnostics materials (NW2020-77).
  99     For the verification of the specificity of the serological tests in March and April 2020, up to n=224
 100     Dutch negative control serum samples (collected before November 2019) were used. These were
 101     derived from subjects tested for different diseases at Innatoss, who had given consent to re-use the
 102     sample for quality control purposes. n=85 serum samples were tested in all tests verified. To acquire
 103     positive control samples for sensitivity verification, n=21 Dutch individuals with a past positive RT-
 104     PCR for SARS-CoV-2 as well as clinical symptoms (fever, cough) were invited to participate in the
 105     verification process and donated blood by finger prick for LFA assessment. n=11 of these individuals
 106     also donated blood by venipuncture to obtain serum samples for IgG ELISA sensitivity verification;
 107     only 6 of these were also available for IgA ELISA verification.
 108     Whole blood samples were obtained with a finger prick in Dutch individuals with suspicion of a
 109     recently experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection. A mobile laboratory unit enabled the collection of
 110     samples in various regions of the Netherlands without violating the COVID-19 behavioural
 111     guidelines. To ensure that sufficient time had passed (>4 weeks after symptom onset) and thus that
 112     antibody responses were detectable, individuals filled in a questionnaire. This questionnaire further
 113     included the onset, end and type of symptoms they experienced prior to applying for the serological
 114     test (common cold symptoms, cough, fever, pneumonia, loss of smell or taste). Individuals were
 115     encouraged to only get tested at the mobile laboratory when they had experiencing symptoms, and
 116     were required to be symptom-free for at least 2 weeks prior to testing. Additionally, some
 117     individuals without symptoms requested testing when either a family member had experienced
 118     symptoms or when larger groups were tested for screening purposes within a company.
 119     When individuals had a positive LFA test, they were invited to undergo a venipuncture to obtain a
 120     serum sample. This sample was used for measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by NCP ELISA. A
 121     second serum sample was collected from interested individuals for diagnostic follow-up. This
 122     included a group of n=97 individuals from the Dutch village of Kessel in the province of Limburg,
 123     which experienced a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak likely in the context of a meeting with hundreds of
 124     attendees on 5 March 2020.
                                                                                                                                  5

 125     To verify potential cross-reactivity of the serological tests, n=23 serum samples were used including
 126     13 samples from an internal collection of Dutch donors which were sero-positive one or more of the
 127     following pathogens: C. Pneumoniae, M. Pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii, Toxoplasma, Legionella, EBV,
 128     HSV-1, CMV, Parvo virus B19). Additionally, n=10 serum samples were purchased from ProMedDx
 129     (Norton, Massachusetts, USA; n=4 human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA); n=6 rheumatoid factor
 130     (RF)). The negative control serum samples used for initial verification further included n=13 with an
 131     old and n=3 with a recent Borrelia infection.
 132     Serological tests
 133     Whole blood obtained by finger prick was tested in two commercial CE-marked LFAs: The BIOSYNEX
 134     COVID-19 BSS using the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) as a target antigen (BIOSYNEX,
 135     Fribourg, Switzerland) and the Xiamen Boson rapid 2019-nCOV IgG/IgM Combo test using both the
 136     RBD and the SARS-CoV-2 nuclear capsid protein (NCP) (Xiamen Boson Biotech, Xiamen, China). The
 137     outcomes of the LFAs were scored positive or negative based on whether the IgG/IgM and control
 138     band were visible with the naked eye. Within the visibility, a division was made between ‘clearly
 139     visible’ and “almost invisible” to distinguish in a later phase whether the intensity of the band
 140     related to the levels of antibody detected by ELISA.
 141     Follow-up serum samples were tested with two commercial CE-marked semi-quantitative ELISAs:
 142     The EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG – S1 ELISA, which uses the S1 domain and the EUROIMMUN SARS-
 143     CoV-2 IgG – NCP ELISA, modified to only contain diagnostically relevant epitopes (both from
 144     EUROIMMUN, Lübeck, Germany). Some samples were additionally tested using the recomWell SARS-
 145     CoV-2 IgG ELISA detecting antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 NCP (Mikrogen, Neuried,
 146     Germany). The EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgA – S1 ELISA was also tested. However, during
 147     verification this test showed a specificity of only 89% and was therefore excluded from further
 148     analysis. The outcomes of the ELISAs were scored as follows according to the manufacturer’s
 149     guidelines: The EUROIMMUN ELISA results are calculated as a ratio by dividing the optical density
 150     (OD) of the sample by the OD of the calibrator (Negative <0.8; 0.8 ≤ Borderline ≤ 1.1; positive >1.1).
 151     The Mikrogen ELISA outcomes are expressed in arbitrary units calculated as (ODsample / ODcut-off control)
 152     × 20, and test results interpreted as: Negative < 20; 20 ≤ Borderline ≤ 24; Positive > 24.
 153     A subset of left-over serum samples was additionally tested using a CE-marked surrogate virus
 154     neutralization assay (sVNT, cPassTM, GenScript, Nanjing, China) for verification and comparison
 155     purposes. The cPassTM sVNT quantifies antibodies of any isotype that interfere with the binding of
 156     the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to surface-immobilized angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2. The outcome of
                                                                                                                                  6

 157     cPassTM was expressed as the relative level of inhibition with a cut-off value of 0.2 (equivalent to 20%
 158     inhibition). The relative level of inhibition was calculated as 1-(ODsample/ODnegative control).
 159     Finally, some individual serum samples were tested for verification and cross-reactivity using the
 160     recomLine SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoblot (Mikrogen, Neuried, Germany) incorporating the SARS-CoV-
 161     2 NCP, S1 domain and RBD domain as well as the NCP of the four endemic coronaviruses (CoV) 229E,
 162     NL63, OC43 and HKU1. The immunoblot score was evaluated by scoring the intensity of the bands
 163     with the naked eye as no reaction, borderline or positive.
 164     All of these tests were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Claimed and verified
 165     characteristics of the assays are summarized in Supporting Table S1.

 169     RESULTS
 170     Selection of tests for two-tiered SARS-CoV-2 serology assessment
 171     To select the most appropriate tests for the two-tiered SARS-CoV-2 serology assessment, a number
 172     of CE-marked diagnostic tests including two different LFAs and four different ELISAs were verified for
 173     their specificity and sensitivity using pre-corona serum samples and samples from individuals that
 174     tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, respectively (Supporting Table S1 and Supporting Figure
 175     S1A). Based on these data, the BIOSYNEX LFA and the EUROIMMUN NCP IgG ELISA were selected as
 176     the most appropriate tests with the highest specificity.
 177     A panel of cross-reactivity serum samples known to be sero-positive for other pathogens, human
 178     anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) or rheumatoid factor (RF) was tested using the combination of
 179     BIOSYNEX LFA and EUROIMMUN NCP IgG ELISA. All samples were scored negative using this two-
 180     tiered approach. The only sample that tested false-positive in the BIOSYNEX LFA with positive IgM
 181     band was the one of the six tested RF samples with the highest RF concentration (Supporting Figure
 182     S1B). Of note, the BIOSYNEX LFA has elsewhere also been reported to cross-react with RF [14]. Given
 183     that the false positive result in the RF serum sample by LFA was subsequently not confirmed in the
 184     NCP ELISA, the combined specificity of these two tests was 100%.
 185     Despite the high specificity of the selected tests in negative control samples, a recurring question
 186     was whether tests would cross-react with endemic ‘common’ human coronaviruses (HCoV). Our
 187     approach had been to use a large group of sera collected in 2019 prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,
 188     and we assumed that a large proportion would be sero-positive for one or several of the HCoVs. In
 189     contrast to other diseases, control sera for common coronaviruses are not easily available. To
 190     demonstrate the presence of anti-HCoV antibodies in the collection of negative control sera, we
 191     employed an immunoblot that includes NCP antigens from the four common HCoVs as well as the
 192     SARS-CoV-2 NCP-antigen, the S1 antigen and the S1-RBD domain. This immunoblot was used to
 193     assay any negative control sample that was false positive in one of the tests verified (n=17) as well as
 194     n=9 negative control samples that were negative in all other tests. All samples tested were
 195     (borderline) sero-positive for at least one of the HCoV, with the exception of a single S1 IgA false-
 196     positive sample (Supporting Figure S1C).
 197
 198     National and regional outcomes of the two-tiered SARS-CoV-2 serology assessment
 199     The two-tiered testing strategy to detect seroconversion for SARS-CoV-2 was offered in a mobile lab
 200     setting for finger prick LFA testing, followed by laboratory analysis by ELISA in serum obtained from
                                                                                                                                  8

 201     those individuals with a positive LFA. In total there were n=7241 consenting individuals who were
 202     tested by LFA between 14 April 2020 and 15 August 2020, including n=3156 males (43.6%), n=4028
 203     females (55.6%) and n=57 unspecified individuals (0.8%). The age range of subjects was 2-95 years
 204     (median 50 years, interquartile range (IQR) 40-59 years).
 205     Due to supply chain issues for the BIOSYNEX LFA (the first shipment was confiscated by the French
 206     authorities for priority national use), the first n=1611 individuals were tested using the Boson LFA,
 207     knowing that the 2nd tier NCP IgG ELISA would filter out false positives (Supporting Figure S1A). Once
 208     available in mid-May 2020, the BIOSYNEX LFA was phased in and used to test another n=5630
 209     individuals (Supporting Table S2). Out of n=7241 individuals that were tested by LFA, n=1481
 210     individuals tested positive by LFA (n=478 by Boson and n=1003 by BIOSYNEX). For both LFAs, 6-7% of
 211     individuals failed to provide a follow-up serum sample for ELISA before August 15 (total n=97)
 212     (Figure 1). The South of the Netherlands - in particular the province of North Brabant - was the
 213     center of the initial spread of infection during the first phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, mainly
 214     linked to travel to and from Northern Italy during the school holidays in the end of February 2020,
 215     followed by regional carnival celebrations [6] (Supporting Figure S2). In line with this, the majority of
 216     all individuals tested was from North Brabant (4300/7241 individuals; 59,4%). When analyzing the
 217     results by area, individuals were more often positive by both LFA and NCP ELISA (35.9% of those with
 218     symptoms and 8.9% of those without symptoms) in the hardly hit village of Kessel and surroundings
 219     (situated in the municipality Peel en Maas in the province of Limburg) than in the area of Amsterdam
 220     (15.4% of those with symptoms and 1.4% of those without; Supporting Table S2 and Figure 1). This
 221     is in line with the much higher incidence of notified COVID-19 cases in Peel and Maas, which is
 222     particularly striking given the much higher population density in Amsterdam compared to the rural
 223     municipality of Peel en Maas (Supporting Figure S2C).
 224     Of note, although some individuals who requested serological testing reported symptoms as far back
 225     as October 2019, positive LFA results confirmed by ELISA were only found for individuals who
 226     reported symptoms from January 2020 onwards (Supporting Figure S3A). The highest proportion of
 227     individuals with self-reported symptoms that tested positive by the 2-tired LFA-ELISA strategy
 228     reported symptoms in March-May 2020 (Supporting Figure S3B).
 229     Focusing on the results of the more specific BIOSYNEX LFA, a change was noted over time from
 230     samples being solitary IgM positive or IgG+IgM positive to solitary IgG positives (Figure 2A). LFA
 231     IgG+IgM positives could be confirmed in the EUROIMMUN NCP IgG ELISA in 94% of the cases.
 232     Confirmation of a solitary IgG positive band was lower (88.7%), except in the presence of a very clear
 233     band in the BIOSYNEX LFA (93.7%; Figure 2B). Moreover, the proportion of BIOSYNEX LFA positive
 234     samples that could not be confirmed by NCP IgG ELISA increased over time (Figure 2C).

 235     When analyzing the data regardless of whether the LFA outcome was IgM+, IgM+ and IgG+, or IgG+
 236     and whether a Boson or BIOSYNEX LFA was used for pre-screening, then out of all LFA+, 77.9% were
 237     positive by SARS-CoV-2 NCP IgG ELISA (67,6% of Boson LFA+ and 82,8% of BIOSYNEX LFA+) and 3.9%
 238     were borderline by NCP IgG ELISA (5.2% of Boson LFA+ and 3.3% of BIOSYNEX LFA+). Moreover, 11%
 239     of positive LFA results were tested negative by NCP ELISA (21.1% of Boson LFA+ and 7.2% of
 240     BIOSYNEX LFA+; Supporting Table S2). The overall lower percentages (compared to the high
 241     confirmation rates of IgG+IgM or solitary IgG+ BIOSYNEX results, Figure 2) are partly due to the fact
 242     that an IgG ELISA was used also to confirm results with a solitary IgM band. Moreover, these results
 243     confirm that the Boson LFA is less specific than the BIOSYNEX LFA and highlight the advantage of the
 244     two-tiered strategy of combining an LFA for screening and an ELISA for confirmation of a positive
 245     result, especially when used in combination with a less specific LFA. Not surprisingly, positive results
 246     were more common in individuals that reported symptoms (18% LFA+ and ELISA+; 0.9% LFA+ and
 247     ELISA borderline) than in those that did not (5% LFA+ and ELISA+; 0.5% LFA+ and ELISA borderline).
 248     Those who failed to report whether they had experienced symptoms or not were clearly a mixed
 249     group with 8.8% LFA+ELISA+ and 0.4% LFA+ELISA borderline.

 251     Stability of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses
 252     As outlined earlier, the village of Kessel and its surrounding experienced a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak
 253     likely linked to a meeting with hundreds of participants on 5 March 2020. n=97 individuals from this
 254     area who were sero-positive in the first round of serological testing (positive LFA followed by ELISA)
 255     returned for diagnostic follow-up 19-93 days after the first measurement, enabling longitudinal
 256     analysis of antibody levels. Out of these 97 individuals, 89 reported symptoms, 7 reported no
 257     symptoms and 1 made no report. 86/89 individuals with self-reported symptoms specified a date of
 258     symptom onset, mostly in calendar weeks 9-12 (24 February – 22 March 2020; Figure 3A. The first
 259     serological testing was performed 39-144 days (median 65 days, IQR 55-75 days) after the onset of
 260     symptoms. There was no correlation between the time lapsed from symptom onset until the first
 261     serological test on the one hand, and the level of antibodies or antibody-mediated inhibition on the
 262     other hand (Supporting Figure S4). Therefore, the absolute level of antibodies and the degree of
 263     antibody-mediated inhibition did not depend on how long after the onset of symptoms the first
 264     serological test was conducted.
 265     Based on this and the fact that the outbreak occurred in a short window of time, changes in antibody
 266     levels in the interval from first to second serological assessment were analyzed for the group as a
 267     whole, regardless of the exact time of symptom onset or whether individuals reported symptoms or
 268     not. While anti-SARS-CoV-2 NCP and S1 IgG levels declined significantly over time between the first
                                                                                                                                10

 269     and second measurement, this decline was not observed for the level of antibody-mediated
 270     inhibition measured by sVNT (Figure 3B). For further analysis, the change in the level of specific
 271     antibodies and antibody-mediated inhibition was calculated as log[test1]-log[test2], and an increase
 272     or decrease of 0.1 was considered a substantial change. When focusing on n=85 individuals with an
 273     interval of >6 weeks (47-93 days) between the two test time points, it was evident that anti-NCP IgG
 274     and anti-S1 IgG levels declined significantly more than the antibody-mediated inhibition of RBD-
 275     ACE2 interaction. In contrast, antibody levels measured by all three testes were stable within a
 276     shorter time interval of 2-5 weeks (19-35 days) (Figure 3C). In this latter group of n=12 individuals,
 277     10 reported symptoms and the first serological test was carried out much later after SARS-CoV-2
 278     infection, 102-144 days after symptom onset (median 108; IQR 105-117 days) compared to 39-103
 279     days after symptom onset (median 63, IQR 54-69 days) in the former group. Overall, within an
 280     interval of >6 weeks there was a decline in SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in 65% and 75% of the
 281     individuals tested for NCP and S1, respectively. In total, 91% of individuals tested showed a decline
 282     in NCP and/or S1 IgG levels (77/85), in contrast to only 31% of the individuals when assessing
 283     antibody-mediated inhibition measured by sVNT (Figure 3D). The number of individuals that were
 284     scored positive at the first and second measurement was 77/85 versus 71/85 by NCP IgG ELISA,
 285     83/85 versus 73/85 by S1 IgG ELISA and 85/85 versus 83/85 by sVNT, stressing the stability of the
 286     sVNT results.
 287     Already in the verification phase with negative control samples collected in 2019 as well as serum
 288     samples from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR+ individuals, the sVNT proved to be both highly specific and
 289     sensitive. Performance of this functional assay was further evaluated with a random selection of
 290     serum samples acquired from the mobile lab setting from n=60 LFA negative and 206 LFA positive
 291     individuals in a side-by-side comparison with the BIOSYNEX LFA, EUROIMMUN NCP and S1 IgG
 292     ELISAs (Supporting Figure S5). In this analysis, 8/60 LFA negative individuals had a low positive result
 293     in the sVNT assay (level of inhibition 20-54%; median 32%). It was already known from the BIOSYNEX
 294     LFA verification that this rapid test is only ~90% sensitive, as it misses 2/20 individuals with a prior
 295     RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, the sVNT was able to identify all 11/11 positive
 296     control samples tested. Moreover, of the 206 BIOSYNEX LFA positive serum samples, 25 were
 297     negative and 6 were borderline by NCP IgG ELISA. In contrast, only 15/206 BIOSYNEX LFA positive
 298     serum samples were negative by sVNT, all but one of which were negative by NCP IgG ELISA. These
 299     data therefore show that the highly specific and sensitive sVNT assay is able to identify additional
 300     samples that contain functional anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies that are missed when using the
 301     BIOSYNEX RBD LFA for pre-screening or the NCP IgG ELISA for confirmation. This confirms the lower
 302     sensitivity of those two tests, alone and in combination, which were in fact selected for their
                                                                                                                                11

 304     correlated more strongly with anti-S1 IgG levels than with NCP IgG level (Supporting Figure S6).

 305     Discussion
 306     In this study, we report the verification, performance and outcomes of a two-tiered serological
 307     testing strategy combining a SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific LFA with a confirmatory NCP IgG ELISA to
 308     assess seroconversion in n=7241 individuals, the majority of which had experienced symptoms
 309     consistent with COVID-19, but had no access to RT-PCR testing. Using this highly specific testing
 310     approach that showed no cross-reactivity with endemic HCoVs, we demonstrate that individuals
 311     reporting symptoms as far back as January 2020 showed seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2. Although
 312     individuals with past symptoms seroconverted more often than those without, a considerable
 313     proportion of 5% of asymptomatic individuals also showed seroconversion, and this number was
 314     higher in an area with a known infection cluster (8.9%) compared to a low incidence area (1.4%).
 315     Overall, 94% of individuals with a positive IgG result by BIOSYNEX LFA were also confirmed by NCP
 316     ELISA. Over time, the proportion of ELISA-confirmed LFA results declined, in line with contracting
 317     NCP IgG titers during longitudinal diagnostic follow-up in a subgroup of individuals. We further find
 318     that in contrast to S1 and NCP IgG titers, neutralizing antibody activity is a lot more stable, and that
 319     both neutralizing antibody levels and S1 and NCP IgG levels reach a plateau after approximately 100
 320     days. The sVNT used to assess SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies proved to be not only highly
 321     specific, but also more sensitive to identify individuals with functional anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies
 322     that are missed using the specificity-focussed 2-tiered serology assessment.
 323     Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of this two-tiered testing approach to retrospectively
 324     inform individuals about the likely cause of their symptoms early during the pandemic when limited
 325     RT-PCR testing capacities left many affected individuals uncertain about whether or not their
 326     symptoms were due to COVID-19. We further demonstrate that this two-tiered strategy of
 327     combining an LFA for screening and an ELISA for confirmation of a positive result is perfectly feasible
 328     even when used in combination with a slightly less specific LFA such as the Boson Xiamen rapid test,
 329     if supplies of a more specific LFA are limited. The high specificity of the BIOSYNEX LFA makes it an
 330     interesting candidate rapid test to support molecular diagnosis or help triage suspected cases when
 331     there is shortage of RT-PCR capacities to help avoid missing true cases of COVID-19 and imposing
 332     unnecessary quarantine [17], as well as for source tracing by identifying seroconverted individuals in
 333     transmission chains that have already cleared infection and are hence not anymore RT-PCR positive.
 334     In the meantime, the focus has shifted for individuals from the question whether or not they had
 335     been infected by SARS-CoV-2, to whether or not this prior infection and the mounted immune
 336     response would provide them with protection against future infection and thus the risk for (severe)
 337     COVID-19 and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to others. With a potential second wave of infections
 338     coming up, this question is not only relevant on an individual level, but also for policy makers and
                                                                                                                                13

 339     health care authorities to determine how to optimally allocate potentially limited capacities for RT-
 340     PCR testing and more importantly both source and contact tracing. Identifying individuals with
 341     protective immunity using an easily scalable functional serological assay would allow for instance to
 342     identify individuals that do not need to undergo repeated RT-PCR testing or self-isolate when
 343     experiencing symptoms, and to release individuals from exposed clusters from quarantine measures.
 344     Since early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been suggested that serological tests could be used
 345     to issue so-called ‘immunity passports’ [18-20]. This has caused heated discussions about potential
 346     ethical, equitable and legal implications as well as public health ramifications due to potentially
 347     increased/encouraged risky behavior by ‘immunity passport’ holders [17, 21]. One often used
 348     argument in this context is that it is not yet established whether antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confer
 349     protective immunity to further infection, what amount of antibody is needed for protection or how
 350     long any such immunity lasts. In the mean-time, a wealth of data has emerged that strongly supports
 351     both the stability (as far as it can be evaluated up to now) and protective efficacy of neutralizing
 352     antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
 353     In line with our findings, several studies have demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies as well as
 354     anti-RBD IgG+ memory B-cells that can produce SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies are generated
 355     and maintained in an encouragingly stable fashion for at least 3-4 months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection
 356     [22-26]. Some studies have noted a contraction in levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies including
 357     neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in the early convalescent phase up to 3 months after
 358     symptom onset and even complete loss in individual cases [27-29]. However, the accumulating
 359     evidence indicates that these early antibody dynamics likely only reflect the typical kinetics of a
 360     primary immune response. In particular, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG level described for a range of
 361     individual patients show ‘text book kinetics’, with an initial peak followed by first a steep and then a
 362     much more gradual decline [28]. Overall, IgM and IgA antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 RBD,
 363     S1 and NCP appear to contract rapidly until three months post symptom onset of COVID-19, while
 364     circulating anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG directed against these antigens remain much more stable [22, 24,
 365     28]. Taking into account that IgA dominates the early neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2
 366     [30] and that neutralizing activity can be observed before an IgG response to S1 and RBD is
 367     detectable by ELISA, this strongly suggests that the initial decrease in neutralizing antibody activity
 368     simply reflects the natural contraction of the short-lived plasma blast response, while a much
 369     smaller population of long-lived plasma blasts is responsible for the continuous production of
 370     circulating IgG antibodies [24, 31, 32]. Much in line with this is our observation that RBD-specific
 371     responses detected by LFA convert from IgM to IgG over time, and that both anti-S1 and anti-NCP
 372     IgG levels decrease when re-tested up to three months after symptom onset, while the levels of
                                                                                                                                14

 373     antibody in follow-up samples obtained 102-144 days post symptom onset are stable. This suggests
 374     that stable antibody levels are reached within 100 days post infection. That neutralizing antibody
 375     levels showed a lesser contraction than NCP and S1 IgG levels might also be due to the affinity and
 376     avidity of anti-RBD antibodies. For very high affinity and/or avidity antibodies, a plateau of
 377     neutralizing activity may be reached, so that an initial contraction of anti-RBD antibodies is not yet
 378     translating in the same degree of decline in neutralizing capacity.
 379     One concern is that on the longer term, antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 might show a pattern
 380     similar to that of the four circulating (endemic) coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1),
 381     to which most individuals are exposed to and seroconvert for the first time during childhood [33,
 382     34]. Antibodies to HCoVs return to baseline levels within one year after natural or controlled
 383     infection [35-37] and challenge infection showed full homologous protection but only limited
 384     heterologous protection after 1 year [37, 38]. As a result, a 2-3 year cyclic re-infection pattern for
 385     endemic HCoVs is observed [34, 37, 38], which is consistent with waning neutralizing antibody titers
 386     to levels that are no longer protective. For SARS-CoV, it was observed that 50% of former patients
 387     lost detectable circulating anti-SARS-CoV antibody responses after 3 years [39]. In contrast to these
 388     total opsonizing antibodies, however, serum samples collected from recovered SARS-CoV patients
 389     17 years after the original infection still showed neutralizing activity against anti-SARS-CoV (8/10) by
 390     sVNT [16]. This indicates that neutralizing antibody levels against this more closely to SARS-CoV-2
 391     related coronavirus may be more long-lived. The longevity of the neutralizing antibody response to
 392     SARS-CoV-2 will need to be determined by carefully designed longitudinal follow-up studies in
 393     cohorts of seroconverted individuals like ours, ideally with prospective analysis of potential re-
 394     infections. A modelling study of SARS-CoV-2 transmission has demonstrated how the duration of
 395     immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection determines whether or not SARS-CoV-2 enters into regular
 396     circulation after the initial pandemic wave [40]. Of note, even a duration of ‘only’ two years
 397     compared to one year of protection would already positively affect the total incidence of COVID-19
 398     over the next five years. On a population level, sero-epidemiological data on neutralizing antibody
 399     levels and their longevity are therefore crucial to support modelling the impact of preventative
 400     measures and post-pandemic transmission dynamics [40, 41].
 401     In regards to protective efficacy, several animal models have provided evidence that SARS-CoV-2
 402     infection induces protective immunity against re-challenge in rhesus macaques, Syrian hamsters and
 403     ferrets [42-45], and protection from disease could be linked to neutralizing antibodies (either
 404     naturally induced or passively transferred) in the Syrian golden hamster model [44, 46, 47]. In

 407     the few that did not contract infection [48]. And even in the event of re-infection, symptoms are
 408     likely to be milder or even absent, as reported for the first documented case for SARS-CoV-2
 409     reinfection [49]. Consequently, passive immunization using convalescent plasma or monoclonal
 410     antibodies for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is also pursued as therapeutic approach to treat critically ill
 411     COVID-19 patients [50-57] and antibody neutralization assays are used as a key read-out in SARS-
 412     CoV-2 vaccination trials in non-human primates and human clinical trials [58-62].
 413     Finally, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it was further observed that upon seroconversion,
 414     shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 dropped rapidly to undetectable levels. Infectious virus could not
 415     be isolated from respiratory tract samples once patients had a serum neutralizing antibody titer of at
 416     least 1:80 measured by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), which may be due to the fact
 417     that infectious virions are still produced but directly neutralized by antibodies in the respiratory
 418     tract. Whether the same holds true for individuals with mild disease remains to be determined.
 419     Nevertheless, the authors suggested that both quantitative viral RNA load assays and serological
 420     assays should be used to monitor individuals to discontinue or de-escalate infection prevention and
 421     control precautions [63].
 422     While PRNTs are the gold standard for assessing functional antibody activity, these assays are labor-
 423     intensive and require a biosafety level 3 laboratory. In contrast, the sVNT assay employed here is
 424     scalable to high throughput use and has shown good agreement with PRNT [16], and has hence been
 425     highlighted as an interesting alternative to PRNT to quantify functional antibodies [64]. This sVNT
 426     also used in a recently published Australian study evaluating a range of serological tests for SARS-
 427     CoV-2 [65]. This study reported slightly lower sensitivity values for the sVNT, likely due to the fact
 428     that serum samples from convalescent Australian COVID-19 patients were collected at an earlier
 429     time point in the convalescent phase. Indeed, they report a considerable increase in sVNT sensitivity
 430     depending on whether serum samples were collected within 14 days or after 14 days of symptom
 431     onset. In our study, all but 2/235 of the individuals with a reported date of symptom onset that were
 432     tested by sVNT provided their serum samples at least 4 weeks after symptom onset (median 62
 433     days, IQR 51-86 days). Ultimately, a key question to be answered in future studies is how the level
 434     of inhibition measured by sVNT at a given serum dilution compares to the level of neutralizing
 435     antibody required at which shedding of infectious virus is reduced to undetectable levels. This
 436     information will be highly valuable for the interpretation of the sVNT test outcome in regards to
 437     protection from future infection in an ‘immunity passport’ scenario. Given that it is not yet known
 438     how long neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are stable and that this may also differ on an
 439     individual level, periodic re-testing will likely be required.

 440     There are some limitations to our study. Firstly, it should be highlighted that our data do not reflect
 441     the seroconversion dynamics in the general population, since we encouraged individuals only to get
 442     tested if they had experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Even amongst this group, the
 443     proportions of seroconversions we find are not representative for the whole of the Netherlands:
 444     Although tests were performed in almost every region of the Netherlands, the majority of tests were
 445     carried out in North Brabant (the most heavily affected area in March/April 2020) and Amsterdam.
 446     Secondly, using the specificity-focussed two-tiered serological testing approach applied here, we
 447     were bound to miss some individuals that had seroconverted. This is exacerbated over time by the
 448     fact that NCP IgG levels contract and thus an increasing proportion of individuals that show a
 449     positive result by RBD-LFA cannot be confirmed by NCP IgG ELISA. Using the sVNT in combination
 450     with the RBD-LFA for pre-screening may partially alleviate this limitation. However, seeing the high
 451     scalability of the sVNT in combination with both its high specificity and sensitivity (provided samples
 452     are collected long enough after symptom onset), it can also simply be used as a stand-alone
 453     screening tool. Thirdly, as any serological screening approach, the small proportion of individuals
 454     which fail to seroconvert [23, 66] and instead only mount a cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2
 455     [67] will logically not be identified. Given that the degree of the antibodies seems to be related also
 456     to disease severity, this may be particularly true for individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection
 457     [27, 68]. Finally, while our data indicate that stable antibody levels are reached 100 days post
 458     infection, the group of individuals that was assessed >100 days post symptom onset consisted of a
 459     mere n=12 individuals. Therefore, analysis in larger groups is needed to support this finding.
 460     In conclusion, we herein present a careful analysis of the performance of a two-tiered serological
 461     testing approach to assess seroconversion and thus retrospectively confirm exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
 462     Our data support that the highly specific LFA used in this combination approach may be useful also
 463     in other settings, for instance to support or complement molecular testing and source tracing of
 464     SARS-CoV-2 infection in transmission chains. Finally, we confirm other studies showing the stability
 465     of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, and provide the first longitudinal assessment of these
 466     antibodies using a highly scalable sVNT. This high specificity and sensitivity assay could thus be a
 467     valuable tool for serological follow-up in large cohorts to support modelling of future SARS-CoV-2
 468     transmission dynamics, support health authorities and provide relevant serological information to
 469     individuals.
