    Abstract
    Background and objectives: Most cancers appear with reduced frequency in Parkinson’s disease
    (PD), but the prevalence of melanoma and brain cancers are often reported to be increased. Shared
    genetic architecture and causal relationships to explain these associations have not been fully
    explored.
    Methods: Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) was applied for five cancer studies with
    available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics to examine genetic
    correlations with PD. Additionally, we used GWAS summary statistics of 15 different types of
    cancers as exposures and two-sample Mendelian randomization to study the causal relationship with
    PD (outcome).
    Results: LDSC analysis revealed a potential genetic correlation between PD and melanoma, breast
    cancer and prostate cancer. There was no evidence to support a causal relationship between the
    studied cancers and PD.
    Conclusions: Our results suggest shared genetic architecture between PD and melanoma, breast, and
    prostate cancers, but no obvious causal relationship between cancers and PD.

    Introduction
    Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex disorder, influenced by numerous environmental and genetic
    factors. Observational studies have suggested associations between PD and different types of cancers
    (lung, skin, pancreatic cancers and others),1-7 such that overall PD is associated with a reduced risk
    of cancer.1, 2 However, the prevalence of melanoma and brain tumors may be increased in patients
    with PD.3-6 In the absence of a causal effect, positive associations may be explained by confounding
    factors (such as toxins that casually influence the risk of specific cancers and PD), shared genetic
    susceptibility or biological pathways, or ascertainment bias (PD and cancer patients both being under
    regular medical follow-up).8, 9
               Linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression (LDSC) can be used to estimating heritability
    using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and examine correlations
    between two traits occurring through shared genetic architecture.10 Mendelian randomization (MR)
    uses SNPs associated with an exposure of interest (such as cancer) as proxies to determine the causal
    association between that exposure and an outcome (in this case PD).11 In the current study, we used
    LDSC and MR to examine whether certain types of cancers have genetic correlation or causal
    relationships with PD.
    Methods
    Linkage disequilibrium score regression
    To investigate whether there is overlapping genetic etiology between PD and the studied cancers we
    performed a search on the GWAS Catalog12 for publicly available full summary statistics using
    keywords “cancer”, “carcinoma”, “glioma”, “lymphoma”, “leukemia”, “melanoma” and selected
    GWASs with a minimum of 1000 cases and of European ancestry. Additionally, we contacted
    authors and requested for full summary statistics. Overall, we were able to collect full summary

    statistics for melanoma,13 breast,14 prostate,15 endometrial16 and keratinocytes cancers (basal cell
    carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma).17 Keratinocytes cancer summary statistics include meta-
    analysis of QSkin, eMERGE and UK Biobank (UKB) cohorts with a total of 28,218 cases and
    353,855 controls. Of the cancer studies with full summary statistics, endometrial cancer, melanoma
    and keratinocyte cancer studies included data from the UKB. We also used GWAS summary
    statistics from the latest PD GWAS excluding 23andMe and UKB data, to avoid potential bias due to
    overlapping samples.18 After the exclusions, a total of 15,056 PD patients and 12,637 controls were
    included in the summary statistics.19 We utilized the LDSC method as previously described.10,                                    20
    Summary statistics were formatted using the standard settings of the munge_sumstats.py script.10
    Mendelian randomization
    Exposure data
    For the construction of genetic instruments, we selected studies from the GWAS Catalog12 using the
    R package MRInstruments.21, 22 First, we searched for traits using the same keywords as before. We
    then selected the most recent available GWAS for each cancer, with a minimum of 1000 cases and at
    least the same number of controls of European ancestry. Additionally, recent GWASs on
    melanoma13 and combined analysis of keratinocyte cancers17 were added as they were not available
    in the GWAS catalog. Fifteen studies were selected for this part of the analysis (Supplementary
    Table 1). UKB participants were included in some of these studies (colorectal cancer, combined
    analysis of keratinocyte cancers, endometrial cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, uterine fibroids).
               We constructed genetic instruments for cancer susceptibility using SNPs with GWAS
    significant p-values (<5×10−8) from each study. The extracted data included rs-numbers, log odds
    ratios, standard errors (SE), p-values, effect alleles, and effect allele frequency. SNPs for each
    exposure were clumped using standard parameters (clumping window of 10,000 kb, r2 cutoff 0.001)
    to discard variants in LD. Additionally, we calculated r2, which reflects the proportion of variability

    explained by genetic variants and F-statistics to estimate the strength of IVs selected for exposures as
    previously described.23, 24
    Outcome data
    As an outcome, we used summary statistics data from the latest PD GWAS.19 To minimize the risk
    of overlap in participants between studies, which could create bias, again we excluded 23andMe and
    UKB data.
    Power calculation
    We calculated estimated power to detect an equivalent effect size of OR 1.2 on PD risk utilizing an
    online Mendelian randomization power calculation (https://sb452.shinyapps.io/power/).25
    Mendelian randomization analyses
    MR methods implemented in the Two-sample MR R package21, 22 were used and are described in
    detail elsewhere.26-28 Firstly, we performed Steiger filtering to exclude SNPs that explain more
    variance in the outcome than in the exposure.22 We then used the inverse variance weighted (IVW)
    method, in which we pooled estimates from individual Wald ratios for each SNP and meta-analyzed
    using random effects.26-28 We applied MR Egger to detect net directional pleiotropy and provide a
    better estimate of the true causal effect allowing to detect possible violations of instrumental variable
    assumptions.28 Additionally, we used weighted median (WM) which is a median of the weighted
    estimates and provides consistent effect even if 50% of IVs are invalid.29 These sensitivity analyses
    were performed to explore heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. Heterogeneity was tested using
    Cochran’s Q test in the IVW and MR-Egger methods.30 For each method, we constructed funnel
    plots to detect pleiotropic outliers (Supplementary Figure 1-6). Additionally, we performed MR-
    PRESSO test to detect outlier SNPs which may be biasing estimates through horizontal pleiotropy,
    and adjust for this.31

    Results
    Genetic correlation with LDSC was performed for melanoma, breast, prostate, endometrial and
    keratinocytes cancers. We observed nominal genetic correlations with PD for prostate cancer
    (rg=0.095; p=0.051), breast cancer (rg=-0.148; p=0.034) and melanoma (rg=0.127; p=0.049) (Table
    1; Supplementary Table 2). Although bias might be a concern, LDSC intercepts were close to one
    in both PD and all the assessed cancer summary statistics.
    Mendelian randomization does not support a causal role for different cancers and PD
    We performed MR with the five cancers for which we had full summary statistics. We further
    included 10 additional cancers with limited summary statistics, resulting in 15 cancers being
    included in this part of the analysis (Supplementary Table 1). The variance in the exposure
    variables explained by SNPs ranged from 0.016 to 0.059 (Table 2). All instruments had F-statistics
    of >10, which is the cut-off that most studies apply to indicate sufficient instrument strength (Table
    2; Supplementary Table 3). No causal effect of any cancer on PD was observed (Table 2;
    Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Figure 1-2). Significant heterogeneity was apparent for
    cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (IVW, Q p-value=0.02) and combined analysis of keratinocyte
    cancers (MR Egger, Q p-value=0.012; IVW, Q p-value=0.012, Supplementary Table 4,
    Supplementary Figure 3). There was some evidence for net horizontal pleiotropy for brain tumors
    (p=0.011) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (p=0.029, Supplementary Table 4) which may
    have resulted in bias to IVW estimates, but the slopes from Egger regression were imprecisely
    estimated. MR-PRESSO identified potential outliers for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
    (Supplementary Table 4). The distortion test did not suggest significant changes in the effect

    estimates after these outliers were removed (Supplementary Table 4). The sensitivity analyses
    revealed no clear evidence for bias in the IVW estimate due to invalid instruments with other
    cancers.
    Additionally, we performed reverse MR using PD-associated SNPs as exposure and cancer summary
    statistics as outcome and did not find any evidence of causal relationship (Supplementary Table 5;
    Supplementary Figure 4-6).
    Discussion
    In the current study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the genetic correlation and causal
    relationships between various cancers and PD. We found a nominally significant genetic correlation
    between PD and both prostate and breast cancers. These cancers are mainly sex-specific and thus,
    our results could be biased. The genetic correlation between PD and sex-specific cancers should be
    tested with sex-stratified outcome data, which was not available for the current analysis. The most
    thoroughly studied genetic relationship is between melanoma and PD.32 Thus far, there is no strong
    genetic evidence for an association between melanoma-related genes and PD.33-35 Previous MR
    studies also did not demonstrate evidence of a causal relationship between PD and melanoma.23
    However, a recent, comprehensive LDSC-based analysis of genetic correlation suggested a
    significant genetic correlation between melanoma and PD, with gene expression overlap.8 Together
    with our current results, it is possible that genetic correlation between PD and melanoma, and hence
    shared biological pathways, explains the increased frequency of melanoma in PD patients and the
    increased frequency of PD in melanoma patients.3, 36
               Our results do not support a causal relationship between the cancers we studied and PD.
    Although MR can help reduce confounding and the possibility of reverse causality, a recent study
    demonstrated that MR is not immune to survival bias.37 PD is mainly an elderly disease, thus it could
    also be prone to survival biases. On the other hand, early mortality from cancer could reduce cancer
    prevalence in PD.38 It is likely that the low incidence of most cancers observed in PD is due to

    survival biases. The high incidence of brain cancers in PD might be related to closer medical
    attention (i.e. more frequent MRI in PD patients compared to the general population).
               Our study has several limitations. We had a limited number of available full summary
    statistics for cancers. Thus, we were not able to perform LDSC between all cancers with known
    associations with PD based on epidemiological studies. Another limitation is that this is European-
    based study only, and these associations or lack thereof should be studied in other populations. In
    both LDSC and MR analyses, we excluded UKB data to decrease the chances of overlapping
    samples between studies, which reduced the statistical power in the different analyses. Lack of
    availability of sex-specific PD GWAS data is the another limitation, which would be crucial for
    studying genetic correlations with sex-specific cancers, or with cancers that have meaningful sex
    differences.39 Despite the fact that some cancers are more prevalent in PD patients, it was not
    possible to perform bi-directional MR for all of the cancer studies since full summary statistics were
    not available. However, we performed bi-directional MR with PD and cancers with available full
    summary statistics and did not find evidence of causal relationships.
               To conclude, our results do not support a causal relationship between the tested cancers and
    PD and confirm a possible genetic correlation between melanoma and PD. Sex stratified PD data
    should be used to verify possible shared genetic architecture with breast and prostate cancers. Once
    larger datasets become available, as well as sex-specific PD datasets, additional LDSC and MR
    studies should be performed on cancers and PD.
