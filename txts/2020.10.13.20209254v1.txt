   ABSTRACT
   Objective: To present Motiro, an unified framework for non-supervised statistical
   analysis endomicroscopy videos of the colorectal mucosa.
   Materials and Methods: We wrote an open-source Python wrapper using ImageJ
   software with OpenCV, Seaborn and NumPy libraries. It generates a mosaic from
   the video of the mucosa, evaluates morphometric properties of the crypts, their
   distribution, and return their statistics. Shannon entropy (and Hellinger distance) are
   used for quantifying variability (and comparing different mucosa).
   Results: The segmentation process applied to normal mucosa of pre(post)-
   neoadjuvant patient is presented along with the corresponding statistical analysis of
   morphometric parameters.
   Discussion: Our analysis provides estimation of morphometric parameters
   consistent with available methods, is faster, and, additionally, provides statistical
   characterization of the mucosa morphometry. Motiro enables the analysis of large
   amounts of endomicroscopy videos for building a normal rectum features dataset to
   help on: detection of small variability; classification of post-neoadjuvant recovery;
   decision about surgical intervention necessity.
   Key words: image processing, gastrointestinal, confocal endomicroscopy, colorectal

   INTRODUCTION
   Probe-based laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) of colorectal cancer (CRC) enhanced

   classify population groups accordingly with their probabilities of developing a

   CRC(2), e.g. by aberrant crypt foci quantification for inference of recurrence(3) and
   neoplasms(4)             chances.          That       entails     the   use      of    computational          tools      for
   complementing human analysis(5) using machine learning-based classification of
   polyps(6) or quantitative analysis of the mucosa architecture by supervised,
   decoupled use of Icy and ImageJ softwares(7). In Ref.(7), the necessity of a unified
   framework for the analysis of the architecture of the mucosa was raised. In this
   manuscript we present Motiro1, a Python-based non-supervised unified framework
   for statistically characterize the morphometry of the colorectal mucosa at pre or post
   neoadjuvant CRC using pCLE videos. Because of its unified, non-supervised
   functioning, Motiro enables the efficient creation of a database of analyzed images
   and clinical data(8) to be jointly used for elaborating an optimal screening and
   surveillance agenda for CRC patients(2,9,10).
   The molecular processes controlling tissue patterning in the colorectal mucosa(11)
   are unavoidable noisy(12). That may cause small fluctuations on the position, shape,
   and size of the crypts of the normal mucosa. Indeed, the link between molecular
   level fluctuations and tissue level variation has been reported on analysis of
   Drosophila embryos development(13,14) and it is fair to extrapolate such a
   conceptual framework for understanding the patterning of the colorectal mucosa.
   Therefore, we analyze the morphometric parameters of the crypts using histograms
   to represent the small degree of disorder exhibited by the normal mucosa. For
   distinguishing the disorder of normal mucosa from that observed at earlier stages of
   a neoplasm or recurrent CRC, Motiro brings two methods for evaluating the
   distribution of morphometric parameters, namely, the differential Shannon entropy
   and the Hellinger distance. The former                               has been widely used to quantify the

   disorder in physical systems(15), and the latter is employed to compare the overlay
   of two histograms (16) representing the distribution of a given morphometric
   parameter. These two quantities enable one to comparatively compute the degree of
   disorder of the mucosa of, for example, a patient and a population, the crypts at pre-
   and post-neoadjuvant therapy, or different regions of the mucosa of a patient. They
   also set a quantitative criterion for helping on the distinction of normal-abnormal
   variability of the mucosa's architecture. Moreover, the unsupervised functioning of
   Motiro enables one to efficiently construct a large database of endomicroscopic
   images statistically characterized. That has a clear clinical implication: one may
   quantify the probability of an observed variability within the colon mucosa of a patient
   to be the classified as either normal or as the early stage of a neoplasm or recurrent
   CRC by, e.g., application of a hypothesis test.
   METHODS
   Dataset images
   The images were acquired using pCLE. pCLE is a real time in vivo method for
   acquisition of 1000 times magnified optical biopsies for evaluating cellular and
   vascular patterns. Before the pCLE procedure, 5 ml of 10% fluorescein diluted in 100
   ml of saline solution were injected intravenously. The probe was inserted through the
   working channel of the endoscope into the rectum a few minutes after the fluorescein
   injection. The pCLE (2.5 mm UHD ColoFlex probe, Cellvizio; Mauna Kea
   Technologies, Paris, France) provided depth of examination of 55 to 65 μm, a 240
   μm field of view at a resolution of 1 μm and magnification of 1000X at 12 frames/s. In
   all patients, normal mucosa located at least 5 cm from the target lesion was also
   examined by pCLE, in order to have a comparison image to the altered mucosa.

   Figure 1: Motiro flowchart. A visual representation of the major stages of Motiro.
   Stage 1 receives endomicroscopic videos as input and provides mosaics and the
   elliptical contours as results. Stage 2 the contours are used to analyze the
   morphometric data and highlight the images for visual assessment of the parameters
   estimation. Stage 3 generates the output by plotting the statistical analysis of the
   morphometric parameters.
   Framework software
   Figure 1 shows a flowchart of the major stages of Motiro. We use a pCLE video as
   input of our wrapper(17). Stage 1, Motiro combines                                     tools from Open Source
   Computer Vision Library (OpenCV)(18), and ImageJ plugin Register Virtual Stack
   Slices (RVSS)(19,20). OpenCV (RVSS) is used for dismantling the video into frames
   and text removal (frame stitching). On the resulting mosaic, OpenCV tools are
   employed for pre-processing, segmentation using k-means algorithm(21), and
   morphometric analysis are executed in Stage 2 (please, see Supplementary Digital
   Content 1 (SDC1) for a detailed description). Stage 3, NumPy and Seaborn Python
   libraries are used for statistical analysis, and data generation for calculation of
   differential Shannon entropy and Hellinger distance.
   Morphometric parameters
   A geometric interpretation of our results was facilitated by converting pixel values on
   the mosaic to micrometers. The crypts were approximated as elliptical contours
   (here on denoted simply as contours) drawn using OpenCV. The ratio of the major to
   the minor edges of a rectangle parallel to the Cartesian axis surrounding the elliptical
   crypt is the axis ratio (α). The elongation factor (ε), is that ratio in a rotated rectangle
   with edges parallel to the major (2 a) and minor (2 b) axis of the contour, with the

   Statistical analysis
   The images were classified as pre (R) and post (T) neoadjuvant for a statistical
   evaluation         of the            morphometric parameters.                    We        quantify the     degree         of
   disorganization of R and T images applying the differential Shannon entropy(23) on
   the histogram of each morphometric parameter:

   details). The differential Shannon entropy for a uniform distribution of a continuous
   random variable within an interval of width L is S0 =log 2 ( L ) can be used as a
   reference value determining the maximal degree of disorder of a distribution or
                                                                   2S

   The use of histograms for characterizing the morphometric parameters requires the
   use of a statistical distance for differentiating two sets of images. Here we choose
   the Hellinger distance(16,24,25) between two distributions P and Q, denoted by
   H ( P ,Q ) , to compute the overlay between two probability densities:
                                                H ( P ,Q ) =√1 − BC ( p ( x ) , q ( x ) )
   where p ( x ) and q ( x ) are probability densities evaluated in x and
                                               BC ( p ( x ) , q ( x ) )=∫ √ p ( x ) q ( x ) dx
   is the Bhattacharyya coefficient. Relative frequencies are used to approximate the
   probability densities when we compare the histograms of a morphometric parameter
   from two images, R and T (please, see SDC3 for further details).

   Endomicroscopy image segmentation
   Figure 2 shows an example of the Motiro estimation of the crypts' contours as
   obtained from the pCLE videos. Fig 2A shows a mosaic which irregular geometry
   results from the imaging acquisition process: the sensibility of the probe and
   absence of reference points causes a maneuvering variability. The field of view of
   the probe is wider than the diameter of a crypt in a normal mucosa which leads to a
   mosaic composed by multiple crypts prone to statistical analysis. Application of
   contrast enhancement and noise removal highlights the crypts from background as
   shown in Fig. 2B. Fig 2C shows a segmentation of the crypts and surrounding
   stroma. Application of morphological operations and application of convex hull to
   smooth the crypts' peripheries is shown in Fig 2D. Fig. 2E shows the elliptical
   contours estimation of the crypts' surrounding after the convex hull. Inspection of
   Figs 2E and 2C indicates the similarity of the elliptical estimates to the segmented
   crypts after removal of noise of the stroma and irregularities of the crypts'
   boundaries. Fig. 2F shows Motiro's (Icy's(26)) contours estimation in green (red)
   overlaid to the original mosaic. The contours of some crypts are less accurate
   because of inaccuracy of segmentation process caused by the brightness of some
   crypts border being similar to that of the background.

   Statistical analysis of the crypts morphometry
   Fig. 3 shows our statistical analysis, the superposed blue and beige histograms
   summarize data for R and T images, respectively, after outliers' removal (please, see
   SDC4 for complete data analysis). The prevalence of single mode histograms and
   similarity between R and T images indicate the regular structure of the normal
   mucosa. Most of the axis ratio (and elongation factor) of the crypts lie within the
   range [1, 1.37] (and [1,1.4]) embracing 84% (and 78%) of the crypts in the R and
   75% (and 69%) in the T images. The R and T images concentrate 74% and 78%,
   respectively, of the crypts' roundness (and 84% and 81% for sphericity) within the
   range of [66%,90%] (and [94.6%,99.9%]). The maximal Feret diameter (and the
   perimeter) of the crypts are lying within the ranges of [81,146] (and [229,461])
   embracing 98% (and 98%) in the R and 92% (and 89%) in the T images. The
   minimal intercrypt distance (and the wall thickness) are lying within the range
   [104,155] (and [4,48]) that encompass 84% (and 71%) in the R images and 81%
   (and 93%) in the T ones. The mean intercrypt distance values are distributed
   accordingly with histograms having a mode within the range [118, 180] and another
   within [211, 273] which, respectively, in the R (and T) images concentrate 56% (and
   33%) and another 30,3% (37,5%) of the data.

   that there is a good similarity on the morphometry of the normal mucosa in both R
   and T images. Such a conclusion is reinforced by noticing that, for almost all
   morphometric parameters, the absolute value of the difference between the means

   being δ, which standard deviation in the R images is smaller. We compare the
   differential entropy of each histogram to their corresponding uniform and 2S /L< 0.848.
   That reinforces our conclusion that the evaluated mucosa has a high degree of order
   despite their intrinsic variability.
   DISCUSSION
   The morphometry analysis presented here has been performed by Quénéhervé(7)
   and collaborators(QA) using Icy and ImageJ softwares separately. Because in QA
   approach the crypts are contoured manually, one may consider these contours as
   the gold-standard. In SDC5 we present a quantitative comparison between Motiro
   and QA morphometric estimates and obtain a mean relative error of 0.167. That
   demonstrates the viability of the unified non-supervised segmentation of pCLE
   videos of the colon's mucosa.
   Though the learning curves of Motiro and QA are similar, Motiro unifies
   functionalities, adds new functionalities, is non-supervised and is 5.7 times faster
   than QA with heuristic algorithm to evaluate crypts(SD6). Motiro runs on a Linux
   Operational System, requires installation of                                 Python(3.6.9), Seaborn(0.10.1),
   Numpy(1.19), and OpenCV(4.3.0), and is executed in a terminal (instead of a
   graphical interface). Images with aberrant crypts could not be properly segmented by

   Motiro and in future work we expect to work on those drawbacks.
   The addition of the statistical analysis of the morphometric parameters enables the
   quantification of the intrinsic small fluctuations of the mucosa's architecture. For such
   study, we interpret the crypt-crypt interlinks as edges of a graph, which enables us to
   establish an estimate of the topographical properties of the mucosa. Then, we can
   use the differential Shannon entropy for quantifying the degree of disorder of the
   mucosa, and Hellinger distances for comparing the statistics of the architecture of
   the multiple mucosas, or of different positions or instants of the same mucosa. The
   statistical analysis based on removed outliers helps to reduce the bias caused by the
   analysis of partial crypts appearing within the edges of the mosaics. The use of
   histogram-based statistical analysis (as alternative to often employed average,
   mode, and median) opens the way for a comprehensive approach based on machine
   learning techniques for the classification of the normal mucosa in R and T images
   and estimation of neoadjuvance success chances. The analysis of a large data set
   may indicate whether the histogram-level differences on morphometric parameters of
   R and T images have a significance and set reference values for both the differential
   Shannon entropy and the Hellinger distances.
   Motiro brings significant improvements to statistically assess and analyze colon
   morphometry using pCLE videos, and is ready for approaching a large amount of
   data obtained from normal and quasi-normal mucosa. Motiro’s image analysis
   approach has the benefit of not needing a large amount of pre-classified data to
   extract features and the morphometry parameters have clear geometrical and
   biological interpretations. That contrasts with machine learning approaches which
   demand large amounts of high-quality data to provide models which geometrical or

   biological meaning can be hard to determine(27). Therefore, machine learning
   approaches may benefit from the construction of a set of results having a clear
   interpretation. Indeed, Motiro is prompt to be employed for building a large database
   of mucosa features to be used on artificial intelligence studies aiming to establish the
   connection among mucosa morphometry and clinical data. The use of statistical
   analysis enables a refinement on the differentiation of normal and post-neoadjuvant
   fully recovered mucosa. That may help on elaborating more assertive machine
   learning-based models to assist physicians to decide about the necessity of surgical
   interventions on post-neoadjuvant colorectal cancer patients. Additionally, the use of
   a unified framework for a quantitative characterization of the architecture of the
   mucosa enables to set additional standards to aid human analysis by reducing the
   role of subjectivity(28). Besides, the modular structure of Motiro can be used for its
   adaptation for analyzing images obtained by advanced methods(29).
