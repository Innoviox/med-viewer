46   Abstract
47   Objective: Mental disorders often emerge during adolescence, and age-related differences in
48   connection strengths of brain networks (static connectivity) have been identified. However,
49   little is known about the directionality of information flow (directed connectivity) in this period
50   of brain development.
51   Methods: We employed dynamic graphical models (DGM) to estimate directed functional
52   connectivity from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data on 979 participants
53   aged 6 to 17 years from the healthy brain network (HBN) sample. We tested for effects of age,
54   sex, cognitive abilities and psychopathology on directionality.
55   Results: We show robust bi-directionality in information flow between visual-medial and
56   visual-lateral nodes of the network, in line with prior studies in adult samples. Furthermore, we
57   found that age in this developmental sample was associated with directionality of information
58   flow in sensorimotor and executive control networks, yet we did not find associations with
59   cognitive abilities or psychopathology.
60   Discussion: Our results revealed that directionality in information flow of large-scale brain
61   networks is sensitive to age during adolescence, warranting further studies that may explore
62   trajectories of development in more fine-grained network parcellations and in different
63   populations.

64   Introduction
65   The brain undergoes tremendous changes throughout life, where childhood and adolescence is
66   a particularly sensitive developmental period for brain maturation processes (Blakemore,
67   2012). A vital part of the brain’s maturation happens in the functional networks that show
68   pronounced reorganization in order to facilitate neural efficiency and integration of
69   information, as indicated by connectome studies in healthy children and young individuals as
70   well as in clinical populations in the same age range (Insel, 2010; Keshavan, Giedd, Lau, Lewis,
71   & Paus, 2014; Kolskar et al., 2018; Rausch et al., 2016; Schweinsburg, Nagel, & Tapert, 2005).
72   This supports that this time period is a sensitive phase, where there is large alterations in the
73   functional interconnections between brain regions as a whole that link to when different mental
74   disorders emerge (Insel, 2010).
75             The primary method to study functional brain interconnections so far has been to
76   estimate static functional connectivity between brain regions, where research has shown that
77   the functional connectome in healthy children and adolescents becomes more specialized (Li,
78   Deng, He, Zhai, & Jia, 2019). Resting-state networks (RSNs) also become more coherent and
79   stable during this time-period (Hoff, Van den Heuvel, Benders, Kersbergen, & De Vries, 2013),
80   and evidence has indicated aberrant connectivity in individuals with pre-clinical psychiatric
81   symptoms (Kaufmann et al., 2017), which is in line with the brain dysconnectivity hypothesis
82   in mental disorders (Connolly et al., 2013; Di Martino et al., 2011; Hamm et al., 2014). Only
83   recently has directed functional connectivity received interest as a field that could yield new
84   knowledge about the connections between brain regions by estimating directionality in neural
85   information flow. Riley et al. (2018) examined effective connectivity, the causal influence that
86   one node exerts over another (Bielczyk et al., 2019; Friston, 2011), in a neurodevelopmental
87   sample and observed that there are differences between sexes in relation to how memories are
88   encoded in the hippocampus. In another neurodevelopmental study by Hwang, Velanova, and
                                                                       3

 89   Luna (2010) the authors observed that improvements in inhibitory control were linked to
 90   strengthening of top-down connectivity for regions implicated in cognitive control networks,
 91   while similar findings were found in relation to top-down processing for a language network
 92   (Bitan et al., 2006). Further, it has been shown that there are differences in directionality in
 93   adolescent boys with externalizing behavior disorders compared to a control group (Shannon,
 94   Sauder, Beauchaine, & Gatzke-Kopp, 2009) and for children with Attention Deficit
 95   Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (Zhao, Zheng, Yang, & Tian, 2017). However, the literature
 96   on connection directionality is scarce, calling for validation of earlier findings and for new
 97   insights using novel approaches. In particular, we do not currently know if and how the
 98   direction flow in the communication between brain networks is implicated in mental traits and
 99   disorders, including cognitive abilities. Given that cognitive deficits are seen across mental
100   disorders, connecting these behavioral and clinical characteristics is crucial for gaining a better
101   understanding of how higher-order processing is characterized in children and adolescence.
102   Such integrative understanding is also important given that no consensus has been reached
103   when it comes to the disorder-specific connectivity alterations that characterize particular
104   mental disorders and the known overlap of symptoms (Craddock & Owen, 2010; Jollans &
105   Whelan, 2018) and the pleiotropy between disorders (Demontis et al., 2019; Grove et al., 2019;
106   Hibar et al., 2015; Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics, 2014;
107   Talkowski et al., 2012).
108             Dynamic graphical models (DGM) is a Bayesian approach for examining directed
109   functional connectivity using dynamic linear models (Schwab et al., 2018). As such, it
110   implements a state space model that is linear and Gaussian in form. This includes statistically
111   stationary properties as it uses a hidden Markov modelling approach, although it incorporates
112   time varying coefficients and as a result can provide information about directionality in the
113   form of a binary view of coupling between two brain regions for each connectivity direction.
                                                                        4

114             Here, we used DGM and publicly available resting-state functional magnetic resonance
115   imaging (rsfMRI) data from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) project (Alexander et al., 2017)
116   to study brain network information flow in children and adolescents and its associations with
117   age, sex, cognitive abilities and psychopathology. We hypothesized that information flow
118   would be strengthened with increasing age (Bitan et al., 2006; Hwang et al., 2010), that there
119   would be differences between females and males in the maturation of brain networks (Riley et
120   al., 2018), as well as alterations associated with information flow for control networks as these
121   nodes are central to a range of disorders (Cortese, Kelly, & Di Martino, 2012; Eisenberg &
122   Berman, 2010; Francx et al., 2015; Geiger et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017; Zhao, Swati, Metmer,
123   Sang, & Lu, 2019).

125   Study samples
126             The HBN is a project organized by the Child Mind Institute (Alexander et al., 2017) and
127   is a resource targeting novel insight into the critical time period when psychiatric and mental
128   disorders emerge. The HBN consortium aims to include 10,000 individuals in the age range of
129   5-21 years from the New York area, where participants are included by use of announcements
130   that are distributed to community members, educators, local care providers with the addition of
131   sending information via email lists and events to parents, encouraging participation of children
132   with clinical concerns to this study (Alexander et al., 2017). Data on these individuals include
133   a package consisting of MRI scanning, genetics, electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking,
134   as well as biological testing and a neuropsychological battery consisting of cognitive, lifestyle
135   indices, behavioral and psychiatric domains in addition to actigraphy and voice and video
136   interviews (Alexander et al., 2017). Exclusion criteria include serious neurological disorders,
137   neurodegenerative disorders, acute encephalopathy, hearing or visual impairment, lifetime

138   substance abuse that necessitated chemical replacement therapy/acute intoxication at time of
139   study, recent diagnosis of a severe mental disorder or manic/psychotic episode within the last
140   6 months without ongoing treatment, in addition to the onset of suicidality/homicidality where
141   there is no current, ongoing treatment (Alexander et al., 2017). All participants over the age of
142   18 years provided signed informed consent, while legal guardians signed informed consent for
143   participants under the age of 18, in addition to participants giving a written assent (Alexander
144   et al., 2017). The Chesapeake Institutional Review Board approved the study (https://www.
145   chesapeakeirb.com/).

147   MRI acquisition and preprocessing
148   MR data was collected by the study team of HBN, where we included MRI data from the
149   following sites; Rutgers University Brain Imaging Center (RUBIC), Citigroup Biomedical
150   Imaging Center (CBIC) and a mobile scanner located in Staten Island. MRI data was
151   collected using one scanner at each site, giving a total of 3 scanners comprising our sample.
152   Rutgers applied a Siemens 3T Trim Tio scanner, while CBIC utilized a Siemens 3T Prisma,
153   and both sites applied the same MRI parameters, where resting- state blood-oxygen-level-
154   dependent (BOLD) fMRI data was collected for each subject using a T2*-weighted BOLD
155   echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with a repetition time (TR) of 800ms, echo time (TE) of
156   30ms, 60 number of slices with the rsfMRI session consisting of 375 volumes and with voxel
157   size= 2.4×2.4×2.4 mm. The third mobile scanner located in Staten Island used a 1.5T Siemens
158   Avanto system equipped with 45 mT/m gradients (Alexander et al., 2017), where the
159   following parameters were implemented; TR= 1.45s, TE=40ms, number of volumes=420,
160   slices= 54, resolution in mm= 2.5×2.5×2.5 mm (for more information about the MRI
161   parameters, see

163   Raw imaging data was downloaded from the HBN database
164   (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/sharing_neuro.html#Dir
165   ect%20Down), and analyzed on the secure data storage and computing facilities (TSD,
166   https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/forskning/sensitiv) at University of Oslo. Image processing
167   tools, based largely on Smith et al. (2013), were used for the functional data while T1-
168   weighted data, which was applied as an intermediate in the registration, was processed using
169   FreeSurfer 5.3 (http://freesurfer.net), including removal of non-brain tissue.
170             As part of the HBN MRI protocol, multiple T1weighted sequences were acquired for
171   each subject, and we used MRIQC for automated quality assessment (N=2427, CUNY scanning
172   site was included for the MRIQC stage, yet this site was dropped at a later stage due the low
173   sample size, N=22). From this, T1 weighted images with the best image quality metrics were
174   used as input for registration, while structural scans that were flagged (N=160) were manually
175   checked and excluded (N=117) if they were of low quality. In addition, 22 subjects had errors
176   when they were run through FreeSurfer and after manually inspecting these datasets, these were
177   also omitted due to motion artefacts and/or having MRI findings disrupting the segmentation
178   pipeline in FreeSurfer. We also made a global mask of the T1 data where we manually checked
179   subjects that had low coverage, excluding another 95 subjects leaving a total of 2171 datasets
180   that had a usable T1w sequence for registration.
181             Two of the MRI sites, RUBIC and CBIC, had two resting-state scans acquired as part
182   of the same MRI session. As such, we merged these scans together to leverage all available
183   resting-state data and to optimize the data for the DGM method that benefits from more time
184   points. Furthermore, the first four volumes for the fMRI dataset were discarded. We
185   preprocessed fMRI data using FSL 6.0.3 (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk), including motion correction
186   and brain extraction. FSL’s FEAT (Woolrich, Ripley, Brady, & Smith, 2001) included spatial
187   smoothing with a Gaussian kernel FWHM of 6 mm and a high-pass temporal filter equivalent
                                                                        7

188   to 100s. FMRIB’s Nonlinear Image Registration tool (FNIRT) was used to register fMRI
189   volumes to standard space (MNI-152) with the T1w volumes as intermediates.
190             We also implemented a cleaning step for fMRI data, where we made a global mask for
191   the fMRI datasets (which indicated data coverage across participants), and from this we
192   excluded 45 of 1813 datasets with poor coverage. To reduce the influence of noise in the data,
193   we removed artefacts by use of ICA-AROMA, which is a classifier that identifies and removes
194   motion specific noise in fMRI data (Pruim, Mennes, Buitelaar, & Beckmann, 2015; Pruim,
195   Mennes, van Rooij, et al., 2015). In addition, FSL’s FIX (FMRIB’s ICA-based X-noisiefier,
196   (Griffanti et al., 2014; Salimi-Khorshidi et al., 2014)) was used with the recommended
197   threshold of 20 to remove remaining motion confounds and other artefacts in the data. Next,
198   data was temporally demeaned and variance normalized (Beckmann & Smith, 2004), and the
199   quality controlled fMRI dataset (N=1678) was submitted to a group ICA, utilizing FSL’s
200   Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components
201   (MELODIC) tool (Beckmann & Smith, 2004; Hyvärinen, 1999), where 30 components were
202   extracted from the ICA and used for further analysis. Dual regression was applied to estimate
203   individual spatial maps and corresponding time series from the group ICA (Beckmann & Smith,
204   2004; Filippini et al., 2009), which were used as input for the DGM analysis.
205
206   Mental and cognitive measures
207   From the HBN data release, N=1768 participants were included after quality assessment. Out
208   of these, information on age was missing for N=332, age at MR for N=3, sex for N=46, and
209   cognitive/clinical information for 740. The participants were 5-22 years (mean: 11.4, years, sd:
210   3.55 years) and 36.3% were females. This data was used to study group-level patterns of dFC
211   (average connectivity matrix). For the subsequent associations with age, sex, cognition and
212   mental health, we had to restrict the analysis to a subset based on data availability. Thus, the
                                                                        8

213   final sample for the association analyses comprised N=979 individuals aged 6-17 years (mean:
214   10.6, years, sd: 2.68 years, 37.6% females). A large proportion of this sample had a diagnosis
215   (N=865), while N=93 did not have a diagnosis, N=20 dropped out before a diagnosis could be
216   determined, and N=1 was missing information for clinical consensus diagnosis data and had as
217   such not received a diagnosis. Broadly, the majority of patients included in our analysis had
218   disorders in the following categories (where comorbidities are included): Neurodevelopmental
219   disorders (N=1306), anxiety disorders (N=464), disruptive, impulsive control and conduct

222             We used the full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) from the Wechsler Intelligence
223   Scale for Children (WISC-V) taken for participants aged 6-17 years as a proxy for cognitive
224   ability. This composite score includes the following domains; visual spatial, verbal
225   comprehension, fluid reasoning, working memory, and processing speed (Wechsler, 2003).
226   Mental health was measured on a continuum including both healthy subjects and patients as it
227   is difficult to uncover robust findings for psychiatric diagnosis that constitutes heterogeneous
228   disorders, showing a wide range in symptoms, severity, duration and prognosis, and as patients
229   often have more than one diagnosis. Such heterogeneity is also reflected in the brain, making
230   the search for biological markers a complex task. As such, for mental health, we performed a
231   principal component analysis (PCA) on The Extended Strengths and Weaknesses Assessment
232   of Normal Behavior (E-SWAN), which has been shown to be a valid psychometric assessment
233   tool for investigating behavior underlying DSM disorders (Alexander, Salum, Swanson, &
234   Milham, 2020). E-SWAN domains include depression, social anxiety, disruptive mood
235   dysregulation disorder (DMDD), and panic disorder. We excluded 3 of the items relating to
236   panic disorder from the questionnaire that had a high degree (>90%) of missing values, giving
237   a total of 62 items for the PCA analysis. The remaining items had available data for 1993
                                                                        9

238   participants with no missing values. We performed PCA using the “prcomp” function in R,
239   where the first PC, often denoted as the p-factor or pF (Caspi et al., 2013), explained 44.0% of
240   the variance (Figure 1). From the loadings from the PCA, this component was associated with
241   items related to self-control and depression/anxiety (Figure 1). In accordance with other studies
242   showing more than one factor being of importance (Alnaes et al., 2018; Mallard et al., 2019),
243   we also included the second principal component referred to as pF2 which was associated with
244   items relating to mood dysregulation. This component explained 11.2% of the variance.

247   Figure 1: Principal component analysis performed on the ESWAN questionnaire taken as part
248   of the HBN protocol. For visualization purpose, only the components included in our analysis
249   are shown. We used the first two principal components as proxies of psychopathology, referred
250   to as “pF” and “pF2”.
251
252   Network analysis
253   We chose ten resting networks from the model order of 30 for inclusion in the dFC analysis.
254   These networks were chosen based on spatial correlation and manually ensuring overlapping
255   ICs with the ten RSNs reported by Smith et al. (2009). The ten networks comprised the default
256   mode (DMN), cerebellar (Cer), visual occipital (VO), visual medial (VM), visual lateral (VL),
257   right frontoparietal (FPR), left frontoparietal (FPL), sensorimotor (SM), auditory (Au), and
258   executive control (Ex) network. These networks were also used in previous DGM studies (Lund
259   et al., 2020; Schwab et al., 2018) and including the same nodes allowed us to compare results
260   with prior findings and to integrate the current results obtained from a childhood and adolescent
261   sample with previous adult studies. The included timeseries for each node were mean centered
262   before estimating dFC from individual level RSN time series using the DGM package v1.7.2
263   in R (for details on the DGM method, see Schwab et al. (2018) or description in the methods
264   section of Lund et al. (2020)).
265
266   Statistical analysis
267   We included all available rsfMRI scans for the group ICA, as a higher number of subjects is
268   beneficial for yielding more robust ICs, while restricting the association analyses to the subset
269   that had all covariates available. We performed the same analysis as previously reported in an
270   adult sample (Lund et al., 2020), examining dFC on the edge- and node-level. Edge-level
271   analysis deployed logistic regression for every connection of the directed network using
                                                                        11

272   directed connectivity as the response variable and testing for associations with age, age-
273   orthogonalized age squared (age², using the poly function in R), sex, cognitive abilities, mental
274   health, tSNR, motion and scanning site (as data was acquired at multiple scanners). These
275   covariates were included into one model (see SI; SFig.3, for additional analyses examining
276   potential multicollinearity for covariates included in the model). P-values were Bonferroni
277   corrected for a number of 90 analyses on the edge-level (alpha level of 0.05). In addition, we
278   performed node-level analysis to examine which networks overall send and receive information
279   to each other (Lund et al., 2020). We calculated the number of output connections or outgoing
280   edges (referred to as out-degree) and the number of input connections or incoming edges
281   (referred to as in-degree) for a given node. We performed linear regression using in-degree and
282   out-degree as dependent variables and the same independent variables as used in the logistic
283   regression on edge-level. P-values were Bonferroni corrected for a number of 10 analysis on
284   the node-level (alpha level of 0.05).
285
286   Results
287   Figure 2 depicts the average directed functional connectivity matrix across all individuals.
288   While many connections indicated bi-directionality in information flow, we found that most
289   edges of the SM network were more often receivers than senders of information. For example,
290   the DMN node sends information to the SM in 79.6% of cases whereas the DMN receiving
291   from the SM was only present in 25.4% of cases. The edge most present across all individuals
292   was SM receiving input from the Au (95.9%). However, this connection was also strongly
293   expressed in the other direction (83.3%). It is also worth noting that we replicated the bi-
294   directionality in dFC between the VM-VL networks that we previously found in adults (Lund
295   et al., 2020), yet in this neurodevelopmental sample we did not observe that Cer and Au
296   networks were mostly receivers, as found for adults (Lund et al., 2020; Schwab et al., 2018).

306     Age effect on directionality and in-degree
307     Edge-level analysis of dFC showed significant effects of age, in line with our hypothesis of age
308     being associated with the functional networks’ maturation processes occurring in childhood and
309     adolescence (Figure 3; SI Tables 1-5 show z-scores and p- values and SFig.3-4 show effects of
310     scanner). We observed a positive association with age and dFC from the VO, DMN and SM to
311     the Ex network. Also, the FPR and Ex send more information with higher age to the SM node.
312                       On the node-level, we assessed similar phenotypic associations for the out-degree and
313     in-degree of the networks. Confirming edge-level results, we found that age was significantly
314     associated with the in-degree of SM and Ex (fig.4b), indicating that the SM and Ex nodes
315     overall receive more information with increasing age. Additionally, there was significant
316     confound effects of scanning site (SFig.3-4) and tSNR on edge-level and network in- and out-
                                                                          13

318             Based on prior studies, we expected that mental health and cognitive abilities would be
319   associated with information flow for control networks, however, this was not observed. We
320   also expected sex-related differences in the maturation of brain networks, but this was not

341   Discussion
342   Our analysis revealed dFC patterns of the visual networks, specifically a reciprocal information
343   flow between the VM and VL networks in a sample of children and adolescence. This seems
344   to be in alignment with findings in adult samples (Lund et al., 2020), However, we did not find
345   that the cerebellum or auditory networks are mostly receivers of information as observed in
346   adults (Lund et al., 2020; Schwab et al., 2018). In contrast, our results implicated the SM
347   network as the network that was receiving most information from other networks.
348             We observed significant associations between age and directed connectivity both at
349   edge and node-level. Specifically, at the edge-level, with increasing age the VO, DMN and SM
350   had higher information flow to the Ex network, and the FPR and Ex send more information to
351   the SM node. Likewise, on the node-level, the SM and Ex node received more information with
352   increasing age. These results support sensitivity of dFC to age within the investigated age range
353   of this developmental sample, especially for SM and Ex.
354             Of note, studies on functional connectivity have implied the SM and Ex network in
355   abnormal brain development (Berman et al., 2016; Cortese et al., 2012; Kaufmann et al., 2017;
356   Zhang et al., 2020) and adults with psychiatric disorders (Birur, Kraguljac, Shelton, & Lahti,
357   2017; Cortese et al., 2012; Kaufmann et al., 2015; Lee, Doucet, Leibu, & Frangou, 2018; Soros
358   et al., 2019).

359             Moreover, it has been reported that the cerebellar network is mostly a receiver of
360   information from other attention and memory related regions in children with ADHD when
361   estimating directed connectivity in rsfMRI using a seed-based approach (Zhao et al., 2017),
362   although we did not find this in our sample.
363             For cognition, FSIQ was not significantly associated with information flow. Here we
364   used a normed cognitive composite test score as a proxy for cognition. However, this may not
365   be an optimal approach as test norms could have limitations when it comes to representativeness
366   and number of subjects included in the normative sample making it less sensitive for clinical
367   populations and for the lowest scoring percentile.
368             Symptoms pertaining to inattention and cognitive control in participants from 8-17 years
369   old with ADHD has been linked to modifications in effective connectivity between control
370   networks in task-fMRI (Cai, Griffiths, Korgaonkar, Williams, & Menon, 2019). In addition,
371   cognitive flexibility in healthy adults has been associated with strong within-system
372   connectivity in higher order systems and from these nodes to primary-sensory motor nodes
373   (Chen et al., 2019). Here we estimated information flow between networks with different
374   functions rather than within-system connectivity (with the exception of the visual networks),
375   which may elucidate the lack of associations with cognition.
376             We did not observe significant associations between dFC and mental health for any of
377   the networks. Our dimensional approach of estimating PCA on symptom data represents both
378   healthy subjects and individuals with a psychiatric disorder on symptom continuum rather
379   than as cases and control. Such a dimensional approach may better capture intermediate
380   phenotypes which map to brain biology and the neuronal mechanisms underlying the
381   symptoms, compared to diagnostic categories (Hengartner & Lehmann, 2017; Krueger &
382   Bezdjian, 2009). While the lack of significant associations in our study indicates that
                                                                        18

383   between-network dFC in large-scale brain networks is not sensitive to mental health in this
384   sample, future research will need to investigate dFC in distinct subnetworks.
385             Finally, we expected to find differences between sexes in relation to directed
386   connectivity as this has been found previously in adolescence (Riley et al., 2018) using task-
387   fMRI, and when examining dFC in adults (Lund et al., 2020). However, we did not find any
388   significant sex differences in dFC on edge- or node-level in rsfMRI. This may partly relate to
389   sample characteristics such as the uneven sex distribution and the inclusion of patients in our
390   sample.
391
392   Limitations
393   As with any MRI study, participant motion during scanning may confound the results,
394   especially as it is known that both young individuals and those with a psychiatric diagnosis on
395   average move more (Satterthwaite et al., 2012). We therefore implemented a stringent
396   correction pipeline, where we implemented several steps of ICA and machine learning based
397   cleaning (FIX and AROMA), and also included the mean relative motion measure from FSL as
398   a covariate in our analysis step. Another relevant confound effect that could potentially bias our
399   results and the comparison to previous work is variability in the ICA decompositions. We here
400   performed ICA in the study sample sample and selected components based on similarity to
401   (Smith et al., 2009). While this approach yielded overall good comparison to previous work,
402   subtle differences between decompositions may retain and might impact the derived dFC
403   patterns. As our results call for follow-up analysis in more fine-grained networks, different
404   ways to parcellate the brain could be tested in such a framework.
405             The majority of the individuals in the sample were patients. Medication may have had
406   an effect on our results, as participants were asked to discontinue stimulant medication but were
                                                                        19

407   still enrolled if they choose not to discontinue due to personal reasons or if recommended by
408   their physician.
409             On a methodological note, DGM reflects instantaneous relationships and does not only
410   look at lagged relationships, however sensitivity of DGM drops depending on the total offset
411   between a node pair and can as such influence the estimation of these interactions (Schwab et
412   al., 2018). Further, DGM estimates binary connections, which may have reduced the
413   sensitivity of the association analyses.
414             Lastly, whether these differences in findings are of methodological origin, such as
415   differences in preprocessing pipelines or network definitions, or can be explained by
416   differences in dynamic connectivity between children and adults remains to be further
417   investigated.
418
419   Conclusions
420   To conclude, using a sample of children and adolescents, we showed that the sensorimotor
421   network receives information from other large-scale brain networks and found that direction of
422   the information flow was age dependent in the sensorimotor and executive networks. These
423   findings contribute to the existing knowledge in the brain development field, and warrant
424   further studies for replication in healthy samples as well as other clinical populations.
