  SUMMARY
  This study applied causal criteria in directed acyclic graphs for handling covariates in associations for
  prognosis of severe COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 19) cases. To identify nonspecific blood tests and
  risk factors as predictors of hospitalization due to COVID-19, one has to exclude noisy predictors by
  comparing the concordance statistics (AUC) for positive and negative cases of SARS-CoV-2 (acute
  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Predictors with significant AUC at negative stratum should be
  either controlled for their confounders or eliminated (when confounders are unavailable). Models
  were classified according to the difference of AUC between strata. The framework was applied to an
  open database with 5644 patients from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil with SARS-CoV-2
  RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription – Polymerase Chain Reaction) exam. C-reactive Protein (CRP) was a
  noisy predictor: hospitalization could have happen due to causes other than COVID-19 even when
  SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is positive and CRP is reactive, as most cases are asymptomatic to mild.
  Candidates of characteristic response from moderate to severe inflammation of COVID-19 were:
  combinations of eosinophils, monocytes and neutrophils, with age as risk factor; and creatinine, as
  risk factor, sharpens the odds ratio of the model with monocytes, neutrophils, and age.

  INTRODUCTION
  COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
  2) stands out for its high rate of hospitalization and long hospital stay and in intensive care units
  (ICU). COVID-19 disease severity can be mild, moderate, severe, and critical [1]. While 81% of those
  infected with COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, World Health Organization (WHO)
  estimates that 14% of those infected with COVID-19 are severe and require hospitalization and
  oxygen support, and 5% are critical and admitted to intensive care units [1]. Reported median
  hospital length of stay (LoS) was from 4 to 21 days (outside China) and ICU LoS was from 4 to 19 days
  [2].
  The severity of COVID-19 states is associated with many risk factors. Early reports suggest advanced
  age, comorbidities, multi-comorbidities, and immunosuppression [3,4]. The enlarging list includes
  diabetes, cardiac disease, chronic lung disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease,
  cancer, liver disease, obesity, hypertension, dyspnea, fatigue, and anorexia [1,5,6].
  Early identification of severe cases allows the optimization of emergency care support [1] and the
  improvement of patient outcomes [7]. However, patients who do not yet meet supportive care
  criteria may fail to receive the necessary care, when there is rapid deterioration or inability to
  promptly go to a hospital. In the transition from moderate to severe cases there can be avoidable
  delays in life support interventions with non-optimized treatments.
  Interest in developing predictive models of COVID-19 outcomes are widespread [7,8]. A review of 50
  prognostic models concluded that they are at high risk of bias [8]. As most studies are focused on
  reporting statistical findings, our concern is with lack of minimum causal criteria to evaluate
  fragmented findings and to identify potential useful associations that are effectively related to
  COVID-19 inflammation.
  In this context, a path to optimized supportive treatments is more reliable assessments of the
  transition from moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 inflammation. We choose nonspecific blood
  tests as they are widely available and hospitalization decision as a proxy to characterize the transition
                                                                                                                                3

  from moderate to severe cases (when not constrained by inpatients availability). After formalizing an
  analytical framework with causal reasoning, the goal is to identify candidate sets of blood tests
  associated with hospitalization (with risk factors), excluding noisy predictors that are not related to
  COVID-19 inflammation.
  METHODS
  Whereas causal effects are clearly predictive, prediction studies usually refer to noncausal analysis
  that uses observational data to make predictions beyond the observed ones and confounding bias is
  generally considered a nonissue [9]. But when one needs more reliable predictions, confounding bias
  and causality should be accounted for in associations. This study applies analytical tools from the
  causal effect estimation of directed acyclic graph theory [10] to investigate associations between two
  sets of outcomes (hospitalization and blood tests) that are related to a common cause (moderate to
  severe COVID-19 inflammation) considering covariates.
  The strength of the association depends on the specificity and sensitivity of the COVID-19
  inflammation pattern, as a kind of distinctive signature of the disease. A low association can also
  occur and means that the pattern with that set of variables allows weak inferences. If a substantial
  association is identified and it is also stable and representative of the target population, then these
  blood tests may be useful as proxies in COVID-19 surveillance protocols and screening interventions.
  Theoretical framework for analyzing associations with causal criteria
  A common use of directed acyclic graph (DAG) in epidemiologic research is to identify sources of bias
  that may introduce spurious correlations [11,12]. A hypothetical DAG model with latent variable was
  conceived to evaluate various types of covariates on the focal association, figure 1. The causal path
  starts with the infection by SARS-CoV-2 (exposure E) that, in some cases, leads to “Moderate to
  Severe Inflammation due to COVID-19” (MSIC, hypothetical latent variable [E→MSIC]), and that
  inflammation causes two outcomes (mutual dependent relationship [H←MSIC→B]): (H)
  hospitalization decision; and (B={B1,…,Bk}) blood tests measured at hospital admission. The blood
  tests are selected according to their strength with hospitalization. The hypothetical covariates that
                                                                                                                                4

  contribute directly to COVID-19 inflammation were considered risk factors (RF={RF1,…,RFL}, mutual
  causation relationships [RFi→MSIC←RFj]). Covariates that affect both outcomes are identified as
  Both-Outcome-Covariate (BOC={BOC1,…,BOCm}) and when affect one outcome as Single-Outcome-
  Covariate (SOC={SOC1,…,SOCn}). These covariates are not exhaustive but to generate causal graph
  criteria for handling confounding factors with the d-separation and d-connection concepts [10].
  The d-separation concept attempts to separate (make independent) two focal sets of variables by
  blocking the causal ancestors and by avoiding statistical control for mutual causal descendants
  [10,13]. Differently, to preserve the association between descendants of MSIC, the focal outcomes (H
  and B) must remain d-connected (dependent on each other only through MSIC) and their relations
  with other covariates (that may introduce unwanted dependencies) have to be d-separated
  (conditionally independent).
  Causal relationships in the DAGs are defined with the concept of the do(.) operator [10,14]. The
  association caused by COVID-19 inflammation can be understood as a comparison of the conditional
  probabilities of hospitalization (H) given a set of blood tests (B) under exposure intervention
  (do(SARS-CoV-2)=1) and without exposure intervention (do(SARS-CoV-2)=0):
           P[H|B=b,do(SARS-CoV-2=1)]                                                                                         (1)
           P[H|B=b’,do(SARS-CoV-2=0)]                                                                                        (2)
  Where P[H|B=b,do(SARS-CoV-2=1)] represents the population distribution of H (Hospitalization)
  given a set of blood tests equal to b, if everyone in the population had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
  And P[H|B=b’,do(SARS-CoV-2=0)] if everyone in the population had not been exposed to.
  The interventions with do(.) generate modified DAGs (or single-world interventions graphs [9]) that
  allows the analysis of the covariates:
            The do(SARS-CoV-2=0) eliminates all arrows directed towards SARS-CoV-2 and to MSIC,
             because MSIC is assumed to be non-existent without exposure (figure 2). Ignoring the
             floating covariates, there are single arrow covariates pointing to hospitalization (RF3, RF4A,
                                                                                                                                5

            SOC1, SOC3) and to blood tests (RF4B, SOC2, SOC4) and fork covariates pointing to both
            outcomes (RF5, BOC1, BOC2).
           Similarly, the modified graph of do(SARS-CoV-2=1) is equal to the former graph and adds
            single arrows from RF1 and RF2 to MSIC; and converts RF3, RF4A, RF4B, and RF5 to fork types
            with arrows directed to MSIC.
  As most covariates are either unmeasured or unknown, their absence can be evaluated following the
  intuition of the back-door criteria [10,11]:
        (a) Covariates with arrow into the causal node (MSIC) are risk factors that may increase the focal
            association between outcomes by increasing the effect of MSIC; and their absence tends to
            weaken the focal association.
        (b) Single arrow covariates and unbalanced fork covariates into one outcome (H or B) may
            distort the association and their absence introduces errors in the focal association, reducing
            the discriminative ability.
        (c) Fork covariates into both outcomes (H and B) may add spurious relations (through the back-
            door) into the focal association, and their absence may inadvertently increase the focal
            association.
  Type (c) introduces non-causally related relations into the focal association and the influence of
  covariates RF5, BOC1, BOC2 can be estimated with the modified model without exposure (figure 2).
  A strong association of the outcomes (without exposure) can be due to these covariates and suggest
  additional efforts to control for them. Another possibility is to exclude the noisy exams that have
  strong spurious associations.
  Model assessment with naïve estimation
  A naïve estimation of equations (1) and (2) is to assume that they are equal to their conditional
  probabilities available in a given dataset at each stratum. The cost of this simplification is that the
  analysis is no longer causal (in a counterfactual sense, because we are not contrasting the whole
                                                                                                                                6

  population exposed and the whole population not exposed [9,14]) and the estimation becomes an
  association between two disjoint sets that each represents separate parts of the target population.
           P[H|B=b,do(SARS-CoV-2=1)]=P[H|B=b,SARS-CoV-2=1]                                                                   (3)
           P[H|B=b’,do(SARS-CoV-2=0)]=P[H|B=b’,SARS-CoV-2=0]                                                                 (4)
  As Hospitalization is a dichotomous variable, this conditional probability, P[H|B=b,SARS-CoV-2=1],
  can be computed through a logistic regression of Hospitalization (dependent variable) given a set of
  blood tests at SARS-CoV-2=1. Similarly, P[H|B=b’,SARS-CoV-2=0] can be obtained with another model
  (same variables but different coefficients). It is implicit that there is the conditioning by a proper set
  of covariates at each intervention.
  The concordance statistic (C-statistic) of a logistic regression model is a standard measure of its
  predictive accuracy and is calculated as the Area Under of the receiver operating characteristic Curve
  (AUC) [9,15]. A simple way to compare the discriminative ability of (3) and (4) is to calculate the
  difference of the AUC at each stratum. A difference of 0.0 means no association with COVID-19 and
  0,5 means perfect focal association of the outcomes and perfect differentiation among strata.
           ΔDiscriminative Ability Naïve=AUC(P[H|B=b,SARS-CoV-2=1])–AUC(P[H|B=b’,SARS-CoV-2=0])                              (5)
  The assessment of the magnitude of the naïve estimation bias requires further refinements with
  potential outcomes and in selecting relevant covariates to render the modeling effort analytically
  tractable to evaluate specific configurations. As a minimum, the comparison of the models with AUC
  values at the negative stratum of SARS-CoV-2 is a necessary improvement in the assessment of
  prognostic models. This is similar to the null values concept in measures of associations of two
  groups with two outcomes to assess if there is any difference between them [9], but generalized for
  continuous multivariable prognostic models.
  Model selection criteria
  The above framework guided our approach to identify sets of blood tests associated with the
  hospitalization due to COVID-19 together with:
                                                                                                                                7

  Source dataset
  We identified one observational database in which, at least partially, we could apply the framework
  and generate candidate prognostic models. Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein (HIAE), in São Paulo –
  Brazil, made public a database (HIAE_dataset)[17] in the kaggle platform of 5644 patients screened
  with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription – Polymerase Chain Reaction) exam and a few
  collected additional laboratory tests during a visit to this hospital from February to March, 2020. All
  blood tests were standardized to have a mean of zero and a unitary standard deviation. As this
  research is based on a public and anonymized dataset, it was not revised by any institutional board
  or ethics commission. The logistic regression models were analyzed with the aid of IBM SPSS version
  22.0 and the causal map with DAGitty.net version 3.0.
  RESULTS
  Of the 5644 patients in the HIAE_dataset [17], 558 presented positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR.
  Of the 170 patients hospitalized (in regular ward, semi-intensive unit or intensive care unit), 52 were
  positive (9,3% rate of hospitalization due to COVID-19). Patient age quantile, from 0 to 19, with
  sample mean of 9,32, was the only demographic variable available. Age was not conditionally
  independent with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR exam. Only 0,9% were positive in the age quantile 0, 1, and 2
  (8 positive cases in 883 exams) while the incidence (not weighted) in the age quantile from 3 to 19
  was 11,7% ± 2,6%.
                                                                                                                                8

  In the first round, the following blood tests were discarded because of poor performance of the
  univariate model when SARS-CoV-2=1: Basophils, Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, Leukocytes, Mean
  platelet volume, Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), Mean corpuscular hemoglobin
  concentration (MCHC), Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), Platelets, Potassium, Red blood Cells, Red
  blood cell distribution width (RDW), Serum Glucose, Sodium, and Urea (Table 1).
  The remaining blood tests are creatinine, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), eosinophils, lymphocytes,
  monocytes, and neutrophils (Table 1). Only creatinine is not related with the immune system directly
  and it will be evaluated initially as a risk factor. Of the 5644 patients, eosinophils were recorded for
  602 patients, lymphocytes for 602, monocytes for 601, neutrophils for 513, CRP for 506, and
  creatinine for 424. In dealing with missing cases, all observations with the required data were
  included (available-case analysis).
  CRP is a biomarker of various types of inflammation [18,19]. At SARS-CoV-2=1, the model with CRP
  and age has good discriminative ability with AUC of ,872 (95% confidence interval (CI), lower bound
  (LB)=,783; upper bound (UB)=,961). But at SARS-CoV-2=0, AUC is also substantial ,774 (95% CI,
  LB=,713; UB=,836) with significant overlap between strata at 95% CI. CRP is a predictor of
  hospitalization in general, but the substantial AUC value at the negative stratum suggests that the
  focal association due to COVID-19 is contaminated with other non-related associations. Models with
  CRP demonstrated sensitivity to resampling within the HIAE_dataset [17], the significance of the
  coefficient moved from ,005 to ,144 (from ,140 to ,148 in other simulations). Similar effects were
  found in models that include CRP with other blood tests and sensitivity to bootstrapping was reduced
  by dichotomizing CRP (reactive/not-reactive). Models with CRP_reactive, neutrophils, and age
  generated AUC of .901 (LB=,826; UB=,977) and ,755 (LB=,684; UB=,827) in the positive and negative

  prognostic studies [20,21,22,23,24,25] (none used data at negative stratum), CRP was excluded as
  candidate.
  The Neutrophils to Lymphocytes Ratio (NLR) is considered as a possible indicator of severity
  [21,24,26,27] of COVID-19, but the NLR could not be evaluated with HIAE_dataset [17] as the
  variables were standardized (division by zero) and were analyzed separately. Lymphocytes presented
  inconsistent behavior in models with two blood tests. Models with only lymphocytes (with and
  without age quantile) indicated lymphopenia when SARS-CoV-2=1, as expected [28,29]. The model
  with lymphocytes, neutrophils and age reversed the sign of the lymphocytes coefficient (SARS-CoV-
  2=1), possibly, due to collinearity between these blood tests (Pearson correlation of -,925 and -,937
  at positive and negative strata, both significant at ,01 (2-tail)). As there are indications of collinearity
  issues at both strata, lymphocyte and neutrophils should not be in the same model as independent
  variables. As models with combinations of neutrophils were slightly better than with lymphocyte,
  lymphocyte was dropped from analysis.
  In the second round, models with all combinations of eosinophils, monocytes, and neutrophils with
  age were tested systematically. Table 2 presents the models with combinations of eosinophils,
  monocytes, and neutrophils (with age) and the best model with creatinine (as risk factor). Table 3
  presents the AUC of each model with the difference of discriminative ability of the association
  between strata.
  Considered individually, eosinophils, monocytes, and neutrophils generated models that have good
  discriminative performance to estimate the probability of hospitalization (models 1, 2, 3 with
  AUC>,810 at positive stratum). The combination of these blood tests generates models (4, 5, 6, 7)
  with better discriminative ability (AUC>,856 at SARS-CoV-2=1). None of these blood tests presented
  AUC superior to ,680 at SARS-CoV-2=0. All models with two or more blood tests presented a
  difference of discriminative ability higher than Δ>,220.
  Two patterns of associations are more salient: (1) age as a risk factor with combinations of
  eosinophils, monocytes, and neutrophils as predictors; (2) age and creatinine as risk factors with
                                                                                                                              10

  monocytes and neutrophils as predictors. The interpretation of the conditional probabilities will
  focus on models 6, 7, and 8, but models with at least two blood tests (4 to 8) are potential candidate
  associations.
  Models 6 and 8 have significant blood test coefficients at p<.05 (with and without bootstrapping),
  but model 6 has an intermediate performance in the difference of discriminative ability between
  strata. Model 7 can also be seen as an extension of model 6 by adding eosinophils into the model.
  Considering creatinine as a risk factor (as a marker of the renal function), model 8 is the overall best
  model with significant coefficients at p<,05 and the highest difference of discriminative ability
  between strata (Δ=,268). This inclusion eliminated the influence of eosinophils from the model and
  can be considered as an improvement from model 6 (monocytes and neutrophils with age) by adding
  creatinine.
  When the coefficients of model 6 (table 2) are converted to conditional probabilities we find that
  with monocytes and neutrophils at average, hospitalization probability is >50% for age quantile >11.
  At average age (quantile 9) and -1 SD (one standard deviation below average) of monocytes (or +1
  SD neutrophils) result in hospitalization probability >50%. At the age quantile 15 and -1/2 SD of
  monocytes (or +1/2 SD of neutrophils) result in hospitalization probability of 86%. Model 7 has
  similar predictions with monocytes and neutrophils (of model 6) with the addition of eosinophils.
  When age, monocytes and neutrophils are at average, there is a hospitalization probability of 51,1%
  with eosinophils at -1 SD; and 90,2% when age quantile is 15.
  Model 8 with creatinine has different responses than models 6 and 7. Age quantile coefficient is
  more pronounced and the odds ratio of creatinine is steep (8,338), so average levels of creatinine
  result in a probability of hospitalization >50% for age quantile >9 (with monocytes and neutrophils at
  average). When creatinine is +1 SD at age quantile 9, hospitalization probability is 85,9% (monocytes
  and neutrophils at average). In fact, only below average levels of creatinine lower hospitalization
  probabilities. Monocytes and neutrophils are also steeper than models 6 and 7. At age quantile 9,
                                                                                                                              11

  Main model biases may be due to contamination with noisy associations and missing cases selection.
  The AUC at SARS-CoV-2=0 is a simplified measure of the magnitude of the spurious association bias
  in both outcomes and all models presented relevant noisy associations (AUC from ,588 up to ,679,
  but not as high as CRP with ,774). Most likely, missing data are not at random (MNAR). We
  performed the bootstrapping procedure to identify potential sensitivity to resampling and, indirectly,
  to selection bias. The selected models maintained the magnitude and statistical significance of the
  coefficients. Apparently, as no significant deviation was detected, the missing cases bias may be less
  pronounced than spurious association bias.
  DISCUSSION
  We focused on models with discriminative ability to identify peculiar responses in the transition from
  moderate to severe inflammation only due to COVID-19. It is not intended to predict mortality nor
  severe to critical cases that require ICU. The risk of overfitting was minimized by not accepting
  isolated variables in “ad hoc mined” models, and by applying causal criteria to evaluate associations.
  The AUC evaluation at the negative SARS-CoV-2 stratum to estimate the influence of unwanted
  covariates into the focal association together with equivalent criteria of severity state at both strata
  is, to the best of our knowledge, a needed improvement in prognosis studies of COVID-19 (as an
  operational procedure of the null values in measures of associations for continuous multivariable
  prognostic models). The selected models are candidates only, the dataset [17] on which they are
  based cannot be representative beyond the patient health profiles of this hospital. HIAE is a
  reference hospital in Brazil with practices, standards, and hospitalization criteria that attends a high
  social-economic segment (mostly living in São Paulo). The observational sample refers to the initial
  phase of the pandemics in Brazil and the patterns may change with medicine prescriptions and other
  changes of SARS-CoV-2.

  In comparison to other prediction studies, we identified a few focused on the transition from
  moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 [20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. Most studies recommend NLR and
  CRP as a predictor. None considered data from the negative stratum of SARS-CoV-2, therefore, these
  models are biased by not excluding noisy predictors.
  We eliminated variables with “high” ROC at SARS-CoV-2=0, so that variables with more peculiar
  responses to COVID-19 were included. CRP is a general marker and not a peculiar response to COVID-
  19. Reactive levels of CRP together with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR exam may be a predictor of
  hospitalization, but this can happen due to causes other than COVID-19 (most cases of COVID-19 are
  asymptomatic to mild) and so the protocol should be different. To include it in a model, one should
  control for all other causes of CRP reactive.
  We have not included lymphocyte count in the models and have not evaluated the neutrophil to
  lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as predictor. Lymphocytes and neutrophils are strongly related in this
  dataset. The similarity of correlations at both strata of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that NLR can also be a
  noisy association with hospitalization too. If other studies validate that CRP is a noisy predictor (and
  also possibly NLR), the remaining associations will have less specificity and sensitivity, but at least,
  they will not generate unreliable COVID-19 predictions.
  We evaluated age and creatinine as risk factors. Controlling for age quantile improved the AUC of all
  models at the positive stratum of SARS-CoV-2. There are other risk factors that can be evaluated with
  this framework, but not with HIAE_dataset [17], and they could lead to different patterns or enhance
  a few ones. The difference between risk factor and outcome among blood tests is subtle. The
  emergent literature is cautious about whether eosinopenia may be a risk factor [30] and whether
  creatinine (and other renal markers) may be associated with COVID-19 renal inflammatory response
  [31]. As an acute inflammatory kidney response to COVID-19, the interpretation changes and further
  refinement of the framework is necessary. If eosinopenia is a risk factor, the prevalence of this
  condition should be considered and must be properly diagnosed at admission, and the models should
  be reviewed with new data. As “inflammation” is latent in the DAG, one cannot test key conditional
                                                                                                                              13

  independencies from this framework (DAGs must be hypothesis driven). Additionally, the usefulness
  of characteristic associations only due to COVID-19 (when existent) is that they can help in the
  identification and estimation of risk factors.
  As we drop noisy predictors, we are effectively dealing with hypothesis about the physiopathology of
  COVID-19 inflammation. Even though not as frequent as the mentions of neutrophils, there are
  studies on the complex role of eosinophils [30,32] and monocytes [33,34] in COVID-19 inflammation
  indicating eosinopenia in severe cases and monocytopenia in some phase of the cytokine storm and
  other COVID-19 pathologies [35].
  We selected two patterns of blood tests that are associated with hospitalization due to COVID-19
  inflammation: age with combinations of eosinophils, monocytes and neutrophils; and age and
  creatinine with monocytes and neutrophils. The model findings are aligned with the known
  physiopathology of COVID-19 but in a more integrative framework of analysis (not as individual
  predictors, but as a set that is related to risk factors). The selected blood tests are broadly available
  even in regions with scarce health care resources. It is unlikely that we will have just one or two
  overall best models; given different sets of risk factors, we should expect a few representative
  patterns of the COVID-19 inflammation from moderate to severe.
  All models can be reproduced by downloading the dataset [17]. More important, we believe that
  most hospitals (and COVID-19 care centers) in regions affected by the pandemics can apply the
  framework to generate similar models appropriate to the target population in which they are
  inserted by making systematic efforts to collect blood tests and potential risk factors at admission
  together with the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and other clinical data. Therefore, by making these databases
  public (anonymized and with standardized data), they will allow future external validation in larger
  target populations and meta-analysis efforts.
