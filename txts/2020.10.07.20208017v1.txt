 1   Abstract
 2
 3   Hearing loss in healthy older adults is associated with accelerated brain volume loss; however, little is
 4   known about this association in those with or at risk for dementia. Using data from the COMPASS-
 5   ND study we investigated associations between hearing loss and hippocampal volume as well as
 6   cortical thickness in older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD, N=35), mild cognitive
 7   impairment (MCI, N=79), and Alzheimer’s dementia (AD, N=21). SCD participants with greater pure-
 8   tone hearing loss exhibited lower hippocampal volume, a biomarker of dementia. They also showed
 9   more cortical thickness in the left superior temporal gyrus and right pars opercularis, suggesting
10   compensatory cortical changes. No significant associations were found in those with cognitive
11   impairment (MCI or AD) who had greater brain atrophy, suggesting that dementia-related
12   neuropathology may supercede any effects of pure-tone hearing loss on brain volume loss. In contrast,
13   greater speech-in-noise reception thresholds were associated with lower cortical thickness bilaterally
14   across much of the cortex in AD. The AD group also showed worse speech-in-noise thresholds
15   compared to the SCD group, suggesting that strong brain atrophy driven by dementia-related
16   neuropathology in AD is associated with hearing problems in noisy environments.

35   1.         Introduction
36   The global prevalence of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) is expected to triple by 2050, leading to
37   immense personal, social, and health care costs1. Attention is now focused on behavioral and non-
38   pharmacological interventions because of the low efficacy of pharmacological treatments (Livingston
39   et al., 2017, 2020). Identifying and treating modifiable risk factors is being adopted as a strategy to
40   delay the onset or progression of AD (Livingston et al., 2017, 2020). Indeed, it is estimated that
41   delaying the onset of dementia by 5 years would lead to an approximate 50% reduction in prevalence
42   after 10 years (Brookmeyer et al., 1998). In a meta-analysis by Livingston et al. (2017) examining risk
43   factors for dementia, the population attributable fraction for hearing loss was estimated at 9%, which
44   was higher than the value for all other modifiable risk factors in the study. In other words,
45   hypothetically eliminating hearing loss from the population could lead to a 9% decline in the
46   prevalence of AD, assuming a causal relationship. Currently, there is insufficient evidence regarding
47   whether or not prevention of or treatments for hearing loss can modify dementia risk, but this is an
48   active topic of research (Deal et al., 2018; Sanchez et al., in press).
49   Hearing loss is a chronic health issue among older adults and is considered to be one of the top three
50   leading causes of disability in old age (Ciorba et al., 2012; Mathers et al., 2008). Typically, age-related
51   hearing loss is characterized by elevated pure-tone audiometric thresholds for high-frequency sounds
52   (International Organization for Standardization (ISO), 2017). Age-related hearing loss is
53   multifactorial, with increased audiometric thresholds at high-frequencies often resulting from damage
54   to cochlear outer hair cells or the stria vascularis in the auditory periphery (Dubno et al., 2013; Mills et
55   al., 2006). In addition, there is evidence that degeneration in the synaptic connections between
56   cochlear hair cells and nerve fibers may contribute to inaccurate coding of acoustic signals, leading to
57   difficulties with speech understanding (Liberman & Kujawa, 2017). Notably, even older adults with
58   normal or near-normal audiometric pure-tone thresholds can have difficulties understanding speech in
59   noise in everyday situations because of age-related declines in auditory processing (Pichora-Fuller et
60   al., 2017). In general, age-related hearing loss leads to difficulty participating in conversations and
61   social interactions and is associated with reduced quality of life, social isolation, and higher rates of
62   depressive symptoms (Arlinger, 2003; Ciorba et al., 2012; Pichora-Fuller et al., 2015; Vannson et al.,
63   2015). Older adults often remark that they can hear but cannot discriminate or easily understand what
64   is said in noisy environments.
65   There is a strong link between auditory and cognitive functioning (e.g. Lindenberger & Baltes, 1994).
66   Hearing loss (defined by pure-tone thresholds or measures of auditory processing such as speech-in-
67   noise or word recognition tests) is related to self-reported (Curhan et al., 2019) and behavioral
68   measures of cognitive decline in aging (de la Fuente et al., 2019; Fischer et al., 2016; Fortunato et al.,
69   2016; Merten et al., 2019). Hearing loss also is linked to incident all-cause dementia (Albers et al.,

 70   2015; Deal et al., 2015, 2019; Gates et al., 2011; Lin, Metter, et al., 2011; Lin & Albert, 2014; Osler et
 71   al., 2019). However, despite growing evidence for a link between auditory and cognitive decline, the
 72   underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Several hypotheses were proposed over 25 years ago to
 73   explain the relationship between hearing and cognitive decline (Lindenberger & Baltes, 1994 and
 74   versions of these hypotheses continue to motivate research); however, no single hypothesis can
 75   explain most of the effects reported in the literature (Pronk et al., 2019). Consistent with the common-
 76   cause hypothesis, associations between hearing and cognitive decline may be based on a common
 77   biological cause such as widespread age-related neural decline (Li & Lindenberger, 2002). According
 78   to the information degradation hypothesis, it is possible that older adults do not encode auditory
 79   information as well as those with normal hearing. When it is difficult to hear, such as in noisy
 80   environments, the listener may increase the allocation of cognitive resources to lower-level perceptual
 81   auditory processing, thereby diverting resources from higher-order cognitive processing and resulting
 82   in poorer cognitive performance on measures of memory for example (McCoy et al., 2005). In
 83   addition, according to the deprivation hypothesis, chronic reallocation of cognitive resources may
 84   bring about permanent changes in patterns of brain activation (Peelle & Wingfield, 2016).
 85   In addition to the auditory-cognitive link, an association between hearing loss and brain atrophy in
 86   gray and white matter has been reported. Greater hearing loss is significantly correlated with lower
 87   gray matter volume in brain regions associated with auditory perception (e.g., superior temporal lobe)
 88   as well as with cognition (e.g., hippocampus, parahippocampus) (Alfandari et al., 2018; Armstrong et
 89   al., 2019; Eckert et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2018; Rigters et al., 2018, 2017; Rudner et al., 2019; Tuwaig
 90   et al., 2017; Uchida et al., 2018; but see Profant et al., 2014). Moreover, longitudinal studies
 91   demonstrate that greater hearing loss is related to greater gray matter volume loss (Lin et al., 2014; Xu
 92   et al., 2019) and lateral ventricle expansion (Eckert et al., 2019) with aging. These findings are
 93   consistent with the sensory deprivation hypothesis, such that less and/or degraded sensory input into
 94   the brain may lead to long-term deprivation effects on the auditory pathways causing structural decline
 95   as well as neurofunctional changes (Lin et al., 2014; Peelle & Wingfield, 2016). For example, Lin et
 96   al. (2014) showed that cognitively normal older adults with greater hearing loss compared to those
 97   with normal hearing exhibit accelerated volume loss in several regions of the temporal lobe (i.e., right
 98   superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri and the parahippocampus) that are important for auditory
 99   processing, semantic memory functioning, and cognitive processing. The associations between hearing
100   loss and brain atrophy provide evidence for the sensory deprivation hypothesis because they suggest
101   that long-term hearing loss is associated with structural loss in the brain.
102   Previous studies of the associations between hearing loss and brain atrophy have examined mainly
103   healthy older adults with no clinically significant cognitive impairment. Studies of those who are
104   particularly at risk for developing AD, as well as in those who have already been diagnosed with AD,
105   could reveal whether hearing loss is independently associated with brain atrophy in those who
106   typically have more vulnerable brains because of their neuropathology-related atrophy. AD
                                                                      5

107   neuropathology typically causes accelerated gray and white matter declines which are also core
108   biomarkers of AD (for a review see Pini et al., 2016). Furthermore, individual differences in cognitive
109   performance correlate with brain structural measures in those with subjective cognitive decline (SCD)
110   and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). For example, lower memory performance in a face-name recall
111   test, which is sensitive to early stages of AD, correlated with smaller right hippocampal volume in
112   SCD and MCI (Caillaud et al., 2019). SCD refers to those who have subjective complaints about their
113   cognitive capacities, but who perform within normal limits on behavioral neuropsychological tests
114   (Jessen et al., 2010, 2014). MCI refers to those who show clinically significant impairment in one or
115   more cognitive domains, while their functional abilities in everyday life are judged to be intact
116   (Chertkow et al., 2019, see section 2.1. for details about diagnostic criteria). There is longitudinal
117   evidence that SCD is a risk factor for cognitive decline as well as for AD and occurs at the preclinical
118   stage of AD and other dementias (Dufouil et al., 2005; Glodzik-Sobanska et al., 2007; Jessen et al.,
119   2010; Reisberg et al., 2010; van Oijen et al., 2007). Similarly, MCI is a strong risk factor for AD and
120   describes an intermediate stage between normal cognitive aging or preclinical AD and AD, although
121   not all persons with MCI convert to AD with reported rates between 20-40% (Albert et al., 2011;
122   Roberts & Knopman, 2013).
123   The extent to which hearing loss is independently associated with (sub)cortical gray matter loss in
124   those with varying degrees of cognitive impairment and neuropathology has yet to be examined. There
125   is little evidence that pathological features of AD, such as amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles,
126   are observed in the cochlea (Sinha et al., 1993; Wang & Wu, 2015, but see Omata et al., 2016). Thus,
127   an independent association between hearing loss and brain atrophy in those at risk for or with AD
128   would be evidence for the sensory deprivation hypothesis in these individuals.
129   In the current study, we analyzed data from the first wave of data released from the COMPASS-ND
130   (Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia) study (Chertkow et al., 2019). The
131   COMPASS-ND sample includes participants with varying types and degrees of cognitive impairment
132   (for more information about COMPASS-ND see: http://ccna-ccnv.ca/compass-nd-study/). We
133   examined the extent to which hearing loss is related to gray matter atrophy in the hippocampus as well
134   as in FreeSurfer-based whole-brain analysis on cortical thickness in those with SCD, MCI, and AD.
135   We hypothesized that greater higher pure-tone thresholds and/or higher speech-in-noise thresholds
136   would be associated with lower cortical thickness in all three groups. Specifically, we expected pure-
137   tone thresholds to be negatively correlated with cortical thickness of primary and secondary auditory
138   areas, the hippocampal volume, and possibly the prefrontal cortex (due to reallocation of resources) in
139   individuals with hearing loss. Furthermore, we hypothesized speech-in-noise reception thresholds to
140   be negatively associated with cortical thickness of primary and secondary auditory areas, the
141   prefrontal cortex, and temporo-parietal areas involved in speech processing. Such associations would
142   be evidence for the sensory deprivation hypothesis in those with or at high risk for developing
143   dementia.

144      2.        Material and Methods
145      2.1.      Participants
146      Of the first and second wave of the COMPASS-ND data released in November 2018 and May 2019
147      respectively, we analyzed the data from individuals who met the criteria for SCD (N=35), MCI
148      (N=85), or AD (N=25). Of those 145 participants, 10 were excluded because they did not have MRI
149      data (3 MCI, 1 AD), did not have hearing data (1 MCI), or were outliers (+3 standard deviations (SD)
150      above average) in cortical volume (2 MCI, 3 AD) skewing most of the correlations. This led to a final
151      total of 135 included participants (N=35 SCD; N=79 MCI; N=21 AD). Table 1 provides an overview
152      of the demographic and health variables for each group, as well as information about participants’
153      vision. We found significant group differences in age, sex, as well as a group difference in education
154      approaching significance (p=.1); thus, we included these variables as covariates in all analyses.

160   General COMPASS-ND inclusion criteria included: being between 50-90 years of age, having a study
161   partner who sees the participant weekly and who can participate as required by the protocol, passing
162   the safety requirements for the MRI scanning, and possessing sufficient proficiency in English or
163   French (as judged by the examiner) to undertake self-report and neuropsychological testing. Exclusion
164   criteria were as follows: presence of significant known chronic brain disease unrelated to AD, on-
165   going alcohol or drug abuse which, in the opinion of the investigator, may have interfered with the
166   person’s ability to comply with the study procedures, severely cognitively impaired individuals with a
167   score of < 13/30 on the Montréal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (Nasreddine et al., 2005) or a
168   symptomatic stroke within the previous year. Written informed consent was obtained from all
169   participants. The COMPASS-ND study was approved by the Jewish General Hospital Research Ethics
170   Board.
171   2.2.      Criteria for SCD participants
172   One core criterion for SCD is a self-experienced persistent decline in cognitive capacities in
173   comparison to previous normal status, which is unrelated to an acute event. This criterion was
174   operationalized by two questions 1) “Do you feel like your memory or thinking is becoming worse?”
175   and, if so, 2) “Does this concern you?”. Only individuals who answered the two questions with “yes”
176   were assigned to the SCD group (following Jessen et al., 2014). Further inclusion criteria for SCD
177   were normal age- and education-adjusted performance on standardized cognitive tests (Chertkow et
178   al., 2019) including a) a score of ≥ 26/30 on the MoCA (Nasreddine et al., 2005), b) a word list recall
179   score of > 5 on the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD), c) 2 above
180   ADNI education-adjusted cut-offs on the WMS-III Logical Memory test the Logical Memory Subtest
181   of the Wechsler Memory Scale-3rd ed. (WMS-III) (Tulsky et al., 2003), and d) no symptoms (i.e., a
182   zero) in the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) (Hughes et al., 1982).
183   2.3.      Criteria for MCI participants
184   Participants and/or informants who reported a concern regarding a change in the participant’s
185   cognition were included in the MCI group if they also met at least one of the following four criteria
186   representing impairment in one or more cognitive domains (Albert et al., 2011): a) WMS-III Logical
187   Memory score < ADNI education-adjusted cut-offs, b) CERAD word list recall < 6, c) MoCA score
188   13-24/30, d) assigned a CDR of ≤ 0.5 and determined to be able to follow daily life routines
189   independently (Chertkow et al., 2019).
190   2.4.      Criteria for AD participants
191   Participants who were diagnosed with AD were selected based on the following criteria (following
192   McKhann et al., 2011): a) A gradual progressive change in memory and/or other cognitive functions
193   over more than six months based on the participant’s and/or informant’s report; b) Objective evidence
194   of a significant decline in at least two domains of cognition (i.e., episodic memory, reasoning, problem
                                                                      8

195   solving, visuospatial abilities, language, personality/behavior) as defined by fulfilling at least two of
196   the following criteria: Logical Memory score below ADNI cutoffs, CERAD word list recall < 7,
197   MoCA score 13-24/30 (with at least one point lost in a non-memory task), or positive response to the
198   question: “Has the participant had any changes in personality or behaviour?”; c) The presence of
199   impairment in functional abilities was operationalized by a positive response to the statement, “The
200   cognitive deficits interfere with independence in everyday activities such as paying bills or managing
201   medications” (Chertkow et al., 2019).
202   2.5.      Hearing loss
203   2.5.1. Pure-tone audiometry
204   Pure-tone audiometry was assessed in an abbreviated screening protocol using a GSI 18 audiometer in
205   a quiet clinical examination room at each site. The screening protocol assessed if participants were
206   able to detect at least one of two pure tones presented in each ear at each of 3 pre-selected frequencies
207   at fixed dB HL levels. First, there were two trials where a 2-kHz pure tone was presented at 40 dB HL.
208   If the participant successfully detected that, then 2 kHz, 1 kHz, and 4 kHz were tested with two trials
209   each at 25 dB HL. Participants who failed to hear a 2 kHz pure tone at 40 dB HL were provided with a
210   pocket talker assistive listening device throughout the neuropsychological and clinical assessment if
211   they did not have their own hearing aid.
212   For the present analyses, participants were assigned to one of six hearing loss categories based on their
213   ability to detect at least one of the two 2-kHz pure tones as described in Table 22. In order to validate
214   these categories, based on the detection of 2-kHz at 25 and 40 dB HL, we applied the same
215   classification method to two large databases in which participants had comprehensive audiometric
216   thresholds measured using standard procedures. First, we applied it to a community-based sample of
217   healthy Canadians who were participants in the comprehensive cohort of the Canadian Longitudinal
218   Study on Aging (CLSA) (Raina et al., 2009), and had undergone a comprehensive bilateral 7-
219   frequency air-conduction pure-tone audiometry as part of their baseline assessment in the study
220   (CLSA data release 3.2; see https://www.clsa-elcv.ca/doc/529 for CLSA audiometry protocol).
221   Audiometric data were analyzed for 27,444 of 30,097 members of the comprehensive cohort who had
222   audiometry data. Table 2 shows the 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz pure-tone average (PTA) of members of
223   the CLSA comprehensive cohort based on the COMPASS-ND classification scheme described above.
224   There was a monotonic worsening in PTA from Category 1 (better hearing) to Category 6 (worse
225   hearing), confirming that the COMPASS-ND method properly distinguishes people according to their
226   hearing abilities.

        Based on an ANOVA, there were no differences between males and females in HL category in SCI, MCI, or
      AD.

234   Second, we used data from the another project (N=242, mean age = 70.67 (SD = 5.94), mean years of
235   education = 15.25 (SD = 2.31), 69.4% women), to investigate stigma related to aging and hearing loss
236   in Canada, to correlate our hearing loss categorization variable with the PTA of full audiograms (1000,
237   2000, 4000 Hz) of the better ear (r=.84, p<.001) and the worse ear (r=.85, p<.001). Overall, these two
238   additional datasets show that our hearing loss categorization based on the more restricted COMPASS-
239   ND hearing protocol was valid.
240   For the statistical analyses we treated the six hearing loss categories as scaled data, because Categories
241   1-6 reflect the degree of hearing loss.
242   2.5.2. Canadian digit triplet test (CDTT)
243   The Canadian Digit Triplet Test (CDTT) was used to assess participants’ speech perception abilities in
244   an adverse listening condition. The CDTT application was run on a Dell XPS laptop using a USB
245   audio card (Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Go! Pro). The CDTT computes a speech reception threshold
246   (SRT) which corresponds to the signal-to-noise ratio at which triplets of digits are recognized 50% of
247   the time. Participants were instructed to listen to three digits presented in speech-shaped background
                                                                             10

248   noise and to repeat them. The CDTT uses an adaptive 1-up-1-down procedure registering a correct
249   response if all three digits were repeated correctly by the participant (Ellaham et al., 2016; Giguère et
250   al., 2020). The standard deviation (SD) of the responses by each participant and the number of her/his
251   reversals were used to identify erratic runs. Based on this procedure, SRTs from all participants were
252   shown to be valid with the exception of 2 participants (1 AD, 1 MCI) who had SDs higher than +3
253   above the mean SD. Their results were coded as missing. Furthermore, the SRT of 1 additional
254   participant (SCD) was coded as missing because this individual’s SRT was higher than +4 dB SNR
255   which is atypical for persons with mild hearing loss in this sample (this participant was categorized as
256   “Mild 1” based on our categories for hearing loss)3.
257   2.6.      MRI data acquisition and analyses
258   T1-weighted images were obtained from each participant using 3T scanners from different
259   COMPASS-ND sites across Canada following the Canadian Dementia Imaging Protocol (CDIP)
260   (Duchesne et al., 2019). The CDIP is a validated, harmonized protocol for MRI data acquisition in
261   neurodegeneration and is available for GE, Phillips, and Siemens scanners. The parameters for the
262   acquisition of the 3D T1-weighted images can be found here https://www.cdip-pcid.ca/. Parameters
263   varied depending on the scanner type and version allowing for the images to be as comparable as
264   possible.
265   First, we compared the degree of global atrophy between diagnostic groups as lower gray matter
266   volume (i.e., greater atrophy) is often used as a biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, cortical
267   volumes of all lobes were extracted from the T1-weighted images by submitting them to the Civet
268   pipeline (version 1.1.11; http://wiki.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/index.php/Civet) developed at the Montreal
269   Neurological Institute (MNI) at McGill University for fully automated structural image analysis (Ad-
270   Dab’bagh et al., 2006; Zijdenbos et al., 2002). Gray matter volumes of left and right frontal, temporal,
271   occipital, and parietal lobes were extracted.
272   Second, in order to analyze the associations between hearing loss and brain structural measures,
273   hippocampal volume was extracted and a FreeSurfer analysis performed as described in the following.
274   Hippocampal volumes were extracted from the T1-weighted images by submitted them to the
275   ANIMAL (automatic non-linear image matching and anatomical labeling) segmentation method which
276   is an atlas-based segmentation method that uses non-linear registration to a pre-labeled template
277   (Collins et al., 1995; Collins & Pruessner, 2010). We then performed a FreeSurfer analysis (version
278   4.2, http://freesurfer.net/) on the T1-weighted images of the same participants. The FreeSurfer pipeline
279   performs surface-based morphometry (SBM) which involves several processing steps that have been
280   described in detail in previous publications (Dale et al., 1999; Dale & Sereno, 1993; Fischl et al.,
      3
        Running an ANOVA, we did not find any differences between males and females in the CDTT thresholds in
      SCI, MCI, or AD.

281   2001, 2002; Fischl, Salat, et al., 2004; Fischl, Sereno, & Dale, 1999; Fischl, Sereno, Tootell, et al.,
282   1999; Fischl, Van Der Kouwe, et al., 2004; Fischl & Dale, 2000; Reuter et al., 2010; Ségonne et al.,
283   2004). The fully automated pipeline was run on CBRAIN (Sherif et al., 2014), a web-based software
284   for computing intensive analyses that generates individual cortical surface models with high spatial
285   precision. Five MCI participants were excluded due to errors during preprocessing. All other brain
286   scans were manually checked for the segmentation precision and 3 MCI participants were further
287   removed from the analysis due to severe segmentation errors.
288   For cortical thickness, the minimal distance between the gray-white matter border and the pial surface,
289   statistical analyses were calculated across the whole brain using the FreeSurfer built-in general linear
290   model (GLM) toolbox to identify thickness of brain regions associated with hearing loss category
291   (GLM 1) and CDTT (GLM 2). Cortical thickness has previously been validated against manual
292   measurements as well as histological analysis (Cardinale et al., 2014; Kuperberg et al., 2003; Rosas et
293   al., 2002; Salat et al., 2004) and has been shown to be reliable in healthy OA (Liem et al., 2015). In
294   order to compute the GLMs, each participant’s segmented brain was morphed to an average spherical
295   surface and smoothed using a FWHM kernel of 15 mm. A significance threshold of p=.001 was
296   applied.
297   2.7.      Statistical analyses and covariates
298   We used age, sex, and education as covariates in all statistical analyses (see Table 1). Comparing the
299   gray matter volume of the cortical lobes between the diagnostic groups, we included the intracranial
300   cavity (ICC) as a covariate in order to control for potential differences in premorbid brain volume
301   between groups (Voevodskaya et al., 2014). When exploring the relationship between CDTT
302   performance and brain structure, we controlled for hearing loss category in order to examine the
303   relationship with CDTT and other measures independent of pure-tone thresholds.
304   Three families of statistical analyses were conducted as follows: First, the three diagnostic groups
305   were compared in regard to their degree of hearing loss and (sub)cortical volumes using one-way
306   ANOVAs (Section 3.1.). Second, the association between the two different measures of hearing loss
307   (i.e., hearing loss category and CDTT) was explored within each diagnostic group using partial
308   correlations (Section 3.2.). Third, in order to evaluate the associations between hearing loss and brain
309   structure, hippocampal volumes were correlated with hearing loss measures using partial correlations
310   and FreeSurfer analyses on cortical data were computed as described above (Section 3.3.). Unless
311   otherwise indicated, an alpha level of α = 0.05 was accepted and effect sizes were indicated by partial
312   eta squares (ηp2).

317   3.1.      Diagnostic group comparisons
318   3.1.1. Hearing loss
319   Figure 1 shows the diagnostic group differences in hearing loss measures. The diagnostic groups did
320   not differ significantly in their hearing loss categories (F(2,126)=.33, p=.72, ηp2=.005; Figure 1, left
321   panel). Most participants were normal hearing or had mild hearing loss, although a notable minority
322   had moderate or greater hearing loss. Diagnostic groups differed in CDTT performance
323   (F(2,109)=2.73, p=.07, ηp2=.05), see Figure 1 right-hand side. Post-hoc t-tests showed that there were
324   higher speech reception thresholds (i.e., poorer performance on the CDTT) in the AD compared to the
325   SCD group (p=.08), with this difference between groups approaching but not reaching significance.
326
327   Figure 1: Figure 1 depicts the diagnostic group comparisons in pure-tone hearing loss categories and
328   in speech-in-noise thresholds (dB SNR) on the Canadian Digit Triplet Test (CDTT). There was no
329   significant difference in pure-tone hearing loss category between cognitive diagnostic groups, but the
330   ANOVA indicated differences in speech-in-noise thresholds between groups which were higher
331   (worse performance) in the AD compared to the SCD group (controlling for age, sex, education, and
332   HL category). The boxplot lines represent the group median (thick line) and the 25th and 75th
333   percentiles (outer lines). SCD: subjective cognitive decline, MCI: mild cognitive impairment, AD:
334   Alzheimer’s dementia.

337   3.1.2. Cortical and hippocampal volume
338   The F-statistics and the box plots of the results of the one-way ANOVAs comparing diagnostic groups
339   in cortical volume of the extracted lobes and hippocampal volume can be found in Table 3 and Figure
340   2. All lobes, but not the hippocampus, showed significant group differences mostly revealing that the
341   AD group had lower cortical volume than the SCD and the MCI groups, while the SCD and the MCI
342   groups did not differ from each other.

344   Figure 2: Figure 2 shows the diagnostic group comparisons in gray matter volume (mm3) in lobes of
345   the left (LH) and right (RH) hemisphere and the hippocampus. Controlling for age, sex, education, and
346   intracranial cavity (ICC), the Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) group had more atrophy than the subjective
347   cognitive decline (SCD) and the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group in all cortical brain areas,
348   with the exception of the hippocampus (*p < .05, ***p < .001). The boxplot lines represent the group

362   R2=.18), suggesting that the more pure-tone hearing loss our participants exhibited, the greater (worse)
363   their speech-in-noise thresholds were on the CDTT. Furthermore, even though the association was
364   only trending in the AD group, the Fisher r-to-z transformation of the correlation coefficients
365   suggested that the strengths of the associations were not different between the diagnostic groups (SCD
366   vs. MCI p=.56, SCD vs. AD p=.36, MCI vs. AD p=.58).

368   Figure 3: Figure 3 shows the associations between pure-tone hearing loss category and the speech-in-
369   noise thresholds (dB SNR) on the Canadian Digit Triplet Test (CDTT) for the subjective cognitive
370   decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) groups: Significant
371   positive associations were found in the SCD group (R2=.41) and the MCI group (R2=.49 or .30 when
372   outliers were excluded), and approaching significance (p < .1) in the AD group (R2=.18). Grey areas
373   indicate 95% confidence intervals.

375   3.3.      Associations between hearing measures and brain structural measures
376   3.3.1. Hearing loss and hippocampal volume
377   Table 4 and Figure 4 show the associations between the two hearing loss measures and hippocampal
378   volumes. SCD participants who had greater pure-tone hearing loss had lower gray matter volume in
379   the right hippocampus (R2=.17). No effects were found in the MCI and AD groups, suggesting that for
380   those with stronger cognitive impairment, the association between pure-tone hearing loss and brain
381   structure was weaker.

383   Partial correlations controlled for age, sex, and education between pure-tone hearing loss category as
384   well as CDTT performance (controlled also for hearing loss category) and hippocampal volume are
385   shown for each cognitive diagnostic group separately.

397
398   3.3.2. Hearing loss and cortical thickness
399   The whole-brain GLM model showed that there were two significant positive associations between
400   hearing loss category and cortical thickness in the left superior temporal gyrus and the right pars
401   opercularis (p<.001) as shown in Figure 5 and Table 5. Both of these significant associations were
402   observed in the SCD group, suggesting that those who had more pure-tone hearing loss had more
403   cortical thickness in those brain regions. No significant associations were found in the MCI or AD
404   groups once we controlled for multiple comparisons.

425   The whole-brain GLM model for CDTT resulted in several significant clusters across the brain as
426   shown in Figure 6 and Table 5. In the SCD and MCI groups, there were a few positive correlations
427   found. In the AD group, there were only negative correlations in temporal, parietal, and occipital brain
428   regions suggesting that those who have greater hearing loss, as measured by speech-in-noise reception
429   thresholds, have lower cortical thickness in a number of brain regions across the cortex.

435   correspond to p < .01), while the p-value was lowered to p < .001 to control for multiple comparisons

439   4.        Discussion
440   The findings of the present study indicate that hearing loss status is differently associated with brain
441   anatomical traits in our diagnostic groups. In persons at risk for dementia (i.e., SCD), pure-tone
442   hearing loss category was associated with reduced right hippocampal volume and increased cortical
443   thickness in the left superior temporal gyrus and the right pars opercularis. For participants with
444   diagnosed AD, the CDTT speech-in-noise thresholds are associated with wide-spread loss in cortical
445   thickness. These findings are consistent with the sensory deprivation hypothesis. Importantly, we
446   demonstrate that diagnostic group moderates the relationship between both hearing measures and brain
447   structure. Our results also provide new insights into the differential relationship between pure-tone
448   threshold measures of hearing loss (i.e., categories based on pure-tone thresholds) and measures of
449   auditory processing (i.e., CDTT) with brain structure. The significance and implications of the
450   findings are discussed in detail in the next sections.
                                                                      18

451   4.1.      The diagnostic group moderates the relationship between pure-tone hearing loss and
452   brain structure
453   We found that our diagnostic groups did not differ in hearing loss category based on detection of pure
454   tones when controlling for age, sex, and education. Yet, the diagnostic groups differed in the
455   associations between pure-tone hearing loss and neuroanatomical traits. Importantly, this suggests that
456   associations between pure-tone hearing loss and brain structure are not confounded by group
457   differences in their pure-tone hearing. A previous study reported that there was a higher prevalence of
458   hearing loss (> 35 dB HL based on PTA of 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz in the better ear) in MCI
459   compared to healthy older adults and in AD compared to MCI and healthy older adults (Quaranta et
460   al., 2014); however, most studies do not have such data because they examine the association between
461   pure-tone hearing loss and cognitive decline in healthy older adults or in a group who were initially
462   healthy and at risk of developing dementia (de la Fuente et al., 2019; Deal et al., 2015, 2016, 2019;
463   Okely et al., 2019; Osler et al., 2019).
464
465    Furthermore, our data indicate that, as expected, those with a higher degree of cognitive impairment
466   also had more brain atrophy. Mostly, the AD group had lower lobe-level gray matter volume
467   compared to the SCD and MCI group, except for the occipital lobe for which the AD group only had
468   smaller volume than the MCI group. This is consistent with the well-known finding that dementia-
469   related neuropathology is related to brain atrophy (for a review see Pini et al., 2016). However, we did
470   not find a difference between the diagnostic groups in the hippocampal volume, which is somewhat
471   unexpected. We note that hippocampal volume was highly variable in our MCI group. There is
472   literature suggesting that those with MCI may be very heterogenous, even when controlling for
473   various underlying neurophysiological causes, likely because some (approximately > 40%) of these
474   individuals will progress to AD or other forms of dementia (Roberts & Knopman, 2013), while others
475   will not (Nordlund et al., 2005).
476   We assessed the association between hearing loss categories, based on the detection of pure tones, and
477   hippocampal volume. We found that more severe pure-tone hearing loss was related to more cortical
478   atrophy in the right hippocampus, but only in the SCD group. Notably, our results indicate that SCD
479   participants with moderate hearing loss (those in hearing loss categories 5 or 6) have 4% lower volume
480   in the right hippocampus than SCD participants with normal hearing or mild hearing loss (those in
481   hearing loss categories 1, 2, or 3),even after controlling for age, sex, and education. In other words, the
482   right hippocampus of these individuals with moderate to severe hearing loss “looks” approximately 8
483   years older given that the normal shrinkage is approximately 0.5% annually for people above 60 years
484   of age (Fjell et al., 2009). Previous cross-sectional research has found similar associations between
485   pure-tone hearing loss and hippocampal volume in healthy older adults (Uchida et al., 2018). There
486   have been similar findings in longitudinal studies showing accelerated decline in the hippocampus (Xu
                                                                      19

487   et al., 2019) and in the right parahippocampus (Lin et al., 2014) across time in healthy older adults
488   with pure-tone hearing loss. Our results therefore extend previous findings showing that the
489   association between hearing loss and hippocampal volume is also evident in older adults who
490   subjectively believe that their cognition has declined and who are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s
491   disease. Future research should investigate a possible link between hearing loss, cognition, and
492   hippocampal volume, given that cognitively healthy older adults with greater pure-tone hearing loss
493   perform worse on memory tasks such as in (delayed) word recall (Colsher & Wallace, 1990; Deal et
494   al., 2015; Ray et al., 2018) and in the free and cued selective reminding test (FCSRT) (Lin, Ferrucci, et
495   al., 2011)) and performance in such tasks is mediated by the hippocampus (e.g. word recall (Fernández
496   et al., 1999) and FCSRT (Slachevsky et al., 2018)), while there are also sex differences to be
497   considered (Al-Yawer et al., submitted).
498   In contrast, the FreeSurfer-based cortical thickness analyses revealed positive associations between
499   pure-tone hearing loss and cortical thickness in the SCD group (corrected for multiple comparisons),
500   but not in the MCI and the AD group. The results suggest that the associations between pure-tone
501   hearing loss and gray matter loss are undetectable or not significant in groups with greater cognitive
502   impairment (i.e., MCI and particularly AD), even though they exhibited strong reductions in gray
503   matter as compared to the SCD group. This is consistent with Xu et al. (2019) who found that more
504   rapid decline in the hippocampus in those with greater pure-tone hearing loss in the preclinical stage
505   (i.e., when AD is clinically asymptomatic but biomarkers suggest the presence of amyloid pathology)
506   and in MCI, but not in individuals already diagnosed with dementia. Nevertheless, it remains an open
507   question as to whether persons with either MCI or AD who have pure-tone hearing loss show greater
508   cognitive decline than those without pure-tone hearing loss.
509   Interestingly, the associations between pure-tone hearing loss and cortical thickness in the SCD group
510   were mostly positive, meaning that those with greater pure-tone hearing loss had more cortical
511   thickness in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the right pars opercularis. Previous studies also
512   have found positive relationships between degree of pure-tone hearing loss and gray matter volume
513   which were interpreted using a compensation framework (Alfandari et al., 2018). The left STG,
514   belonging to the auditory association cortex, is involved in the spectro-temporal analysis of speech
515   (Hickok & Poeppel, 2007) and multisensory integration of auditory and visual speech cues (Callan et
516   al., 2001; Möttönen et al., 2002). The structural integrity of the left STG is a predictor of auditory
517   working memory (Leff et al., 2009). It is possible therefore that those who have greater pure-tone
518   hearing loss rely more on multisensory cues (e.g., visual speech cues) and on working memory during
519   speech understanding such that they show alterations in the structure of the STG as a function of pure-
520   tone hearing loss. Similarly, the right pars opercularis is involved in speech processing (Vigneau et al.,
521   2011), particularly in speech perception tasks involving vowel tone pitch discrimination (Joanisse &
522   Gati, 2003), syllable discrimination (Poeppel et al., 2004), and in sentence pitch and linguistic prosody
523   processing (Meyer et al., 2002). Thus, it is possible that those with greater pure-tone hearing loss
                                                                      20

524   might rely more on prosodic speech cues (Giroud et al., 2018, 2019), leading to structural plasticity in
525   the right pars opercularis.
526   In sum, our cross-sectional analysis indicates that moderate pure-tone hearing loss in those who are
527   otherwise cognitively healthy, but who have subjective cognitive complaints, is associated with lower
528   volume in the right hippocampus, a biomarker of dementia. We note that we did not find lower
529   hippocampal volume as a function of pure-tone hearing loss in the MCI or AD group in our sample.
530   Furthermore, those with greater pure-tone hearing loss in the SCD group also exhibited more cortical
531   thickness in the left STG and the right pars opercularis. This finding suggests potentially
532   compensatory structural plasticity insofar as those with greater pure-tone hearing loss may rely more
533   on multisensory and prosodic speech cues as well as the phonological loop component in their
534   working memory during speech understanding compared to those with less severe pure-tone hearing
535   loss. The fact that these hearing-brain structure associations were found only in individuals with SCD,
536   but not MCI or AD, suggests that dementia-related neuropathology, which is reflected in brain atrophy
537   among other biomarkers, overshadows the potential effects of pure-tone hearing loss on brain
538   structure.
539   4.2.      Hearing loss - brain structure associations depend on hearing loss measurement
540   In addition to the association between measures of brain structure and hearing loss category based on
541   the detection of pure tones, we conducted the same analyses using the CDTT measure of speech-in-
542   noise threshold. Independent of hearing loss category, CDTT speech-in-noise thresholds were lower
543   (better) for the SCD group compared to the AD group. This result suggests that those with AD have
544   difficulty recognizing even very simple speech stimuli in noise, which was also shown in previous
545   research which found strong dysfunctions of auditory processing in individuals with AD and partially
546   also in those with MCI (Idrizbegovic et al., 2011).
547   We also investigated the associations between the CDTT results and cortical thickness in all three
548   diagnostic groups. For the AD group only, we found negative correlations between the CDTT speech-
549   in-noise thresholds and brain structure across the whole brain, such that those with poorer performance
550   on the CDTT had lower gray matter volume in bilateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, as well as
551   in the right occipital lobe and lower cortical thickness in bilateral superior temporal gyri, right inferior
552   temporal gyrus, right lateral occipital gyrus, and the right superior parietal gyrus. Previous research
553   has found similar associations between speech-in-noise perception performance and macro-anatomical
554   measures of the cortex in healthy older adults, which were more focal in nature (Giroud et al.,
555   submitted, 2018; Rudner et al., 2019). Cortical volume and cortical thickness change as a function of
556   experience, training, pathology, and lifespan changes and are therefore subject to plasticity (Bermudez
557   et al., 2009; Engvig et al., 2010; Fjell et al., 2009). It is possible that poorer CDTT speech-in-noise
558   thresholds in the AD group might correspond to a lower number, packing density, and size of cells
559   within neural columns (Rakic, 1988, 1995) in multiple brain regions. Thus, these results may support
                                                                      21

560   the sensory deprivation hypothesis insofar as continued impoverished auditory input may have wide-
561   spread effects across the cortex that manifests as gray matter atrophy.
562   An alternative, and equally likely an explanation, derives from the fact that a large (sub)cortical brain
563   network supporting auditory-cognitive functioning is involved in speech-in-noise processing from the
564   auditory brainstem (Anderson et al., 2011, 2013) up to higher areas such as the right inferior frontal
565   gyrus and the right insula (Bidelman & Howell, 2016), including parietal brain regions such as the
566   precuneus (Wong et al., 2009). These brain regions involved in speech-in-noise processing are similar
567   to the brain structures we show to correlate with CDTT speech-in-noise reception in the present study.
568   Thus, it also is possible that the association found in the present study between the CDTT measure of
569   speech-in-noise processing and brain structures reflect the neural sources involved in performing the
570   complex task of speech discrimination in noise. In other words, it is possible that individuals with
571   reduced gray matter volume and cortical thickness (more atrophy, i.e., those with AD) in those brain
572   regions perform worse on the speech-in-noise task due to less available neural resources. However,
573   longitudinal research and functional imaging is needed to clarify the direction of the results since it is
574   also possible that increasing difficulties understanding speech-in-noise perception could lead to a
575   structural decline in those brain regions, as suggested by a recent cross-sectional study in healthy older
576   adults (Rudner et al., 2019). The study found that lower performance on a speech-in-noise task was
577   related to lower gray matter volume in brain regions associated with hearing and cognition.
578   Similar to Giroud et al. (2018), we found associations between speech-in-noise perception
579   performances and brain structures in visual brain areas (i.e., volume in the right occipital lobe and
580   cortical thickness in the right lateral occipital gyrus). Visual activation is present during hearing tasks
581   (Giraud & Truy, 2002), especially in individuals with severe hearing loss such as those using cochlear
582   implants (Giraud et al., 2001). It is possible that individuals with greater hearing loss rely more on
583   visual speech cues and therefore co-activate visual areas during speech understanding, potentially even
584   when there are no visual speech cues available. We speculate that this interpretation could be valid in
585   the present study because most participants had good visual acuity (Table 1). Nevertheless, we
586   recognize that there is a distinction between structure and function and that the association between
587   neural activation and cortical thickness is not straightforward.
588   As mentioned above, we only found very wide-spread and negative associations between CDTT
589   speech-in-noise reception thresholds and brain structure in the AD group who had most pronounced
590   brain atrophy. In the other two groups, we found few and only very focal positive associations
591   between speech-in-noise reception thresholds and cortical thickness (SCD: left posterior cingulum,
592   right superior temporal gyrus; MCI: right superior frontal gyrus, right lateral orbitofrontal gyrus, and
593   anterior cingulum). Given that these groups have less brain atrophy than the AD group, our findings
594   suggest that individuals who have better brain structural integrity in regions involved in cognitive
595   processes (Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2012; Schermuly et al., 2010) during speech-in-noise perception
                                                                      22

596   (Bidelman & Howell, 2016; Du et al., 2016) might be able to use these regions to compensate for
597   difficulties understanding speech-in-noise (Rönnberg et al., 2008, 2013).
598   Overall, our data provide evidence that speech-in-noise recognition may be disproportionately
599   impaired in older adults with AD. Our results further show that persons with AD who have more
600   structural decline in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes perform worse on the CDTT. It is
601   possible, that dementia-related neuropathology, which leads to accelerated decline of brain structures,
602   may exacerbate or lead to a decline in speech processing in adverse listening conditions. Alternatively,
603   declines in auditory processing may have wide-spread effects on brain atrophy in older adults with
604   AD. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the direction of these effects.
605   4.3.      Limitations
606   One limitation of the present study is that we do not have standard pure-tone audiograms for our
607   participants because of the audiometric screening approach that was used. However, we were able to
608   validate our hearing loss categorization method by mapping it to grades of hearing determined based
609   on audiograms in two independent samples of older adults. Moreover, we have shown that there is a
610   significant positive correlation between our hearing loss categorization and the speech-in-noise
611   reception thresholds in the CDTT (R2 ranging from .18 - .41 depending on diagnostic group),
612   indicating that our hearing loss categorization meaningfully reflects losses in hearing that affect
613   speech-in-noise perception as shown previously in the literature (Dubno et al., 1984; Giroud et al.,
614   2017; Gordon-Salant & Fitzgibbons, 2001; Zekveld et al., 2011).
615   Another shortcoming is the cross-sectional nature of the study. In order to clarify the direction of the
616   hearing loss - brain volume/thickness associations, longitudinal data are needed. In the COMPASS-
617   ND study, longitudinal data are currently being collected from the same participants. Thus, the current
618   report is a first step toward understanding the possible effects of hearing loss on brain structures in
619   those diagnostic groups.
620   Furthermore, it remains an open question as to what degree our sample is representative of others with
621   SCD, MCI, and AD in the general population. First, we did not find differences in hippocampal
622   volume between the diagnostic groups, even though this is a well-reported finding in the literature.
623   Second, our diagnostic groups have skewed sex ratios, which may not be representative of each of the
624   diagnostic groups. Finally, our participants were self-selected volunteers from clinical research sites
625   who agreed to be in a research study involving the administration of an extensive test battery.
626   4.4.      Conclusion
627   Our study investigated the association between hearing loss and brain structure in older adults at risk
628   of and with dementia, extending previous research on healthy older adults. As compared to previous
629   research, we not only tested pure-tone thresholds to assess hearing loss, but also included a measure of
                                                                      23

630   auditory perception, namely speech-in-noise reception thresholds. Older adults with near-normal pure-
631   tone thresholds often report to have difficulties understanding speech in noisy environments.
632   Our results are consistent with the sensory deprivation hypothesis. In those with greater pure-tone
633   hearing loss in the SCD group we found lower hippocampal volume, which is a biomarker of
634   dementia, as well as more cortical thickness in auditory and higher-order language-related areas
635   potentially reflecting compensatory effects. No such associations between pure-tone hearing loss and
636   brain structure were found in MCI or AD suggesting that pathology-related atrophy dominates
637   potential neuroanatomical effects of pure-tone hearing loss. Nevertheless, in the MCI and AD group
638   only, we found that those with greater speech-in-noise reception thresholds exhibited lower cortical
639   thickness globally in both hemispheres. It is therefore possible that an age-related decline in speech-in-
640   noise understanding may result in brain structural decline in older adults who have (mild) cognitive
641   impairment. Alternatively, and because the AD group performed slightly worse in the speech-in-noise
642   task compared to the SCD group, it is also possible that dementia-related atrophy in brain regions
643   supporting auditory processing leads to a decline in speech-in-noise understanding. Longitudinal
644   research is needed to clarify the potential causal mechanisms. Our work extends the research on
645   hearing-brain associations to include those who have subjective or objective cognitive complaints and
646   suggests that these relationships evolve as disease progresses.
