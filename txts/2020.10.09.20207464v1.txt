    Abstract
              COVID-19 patients may exhibit neuropsychiatric and/or neurological symptoms. We
    found that anxiety and cognitive impairment are manifested by 28-56% of
    SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with mild or no respiratory symptoms and are associated with
    altered cerebral cortical thickness. Using an independent cohort, we found histopathological
    signs of brain damage in 19% of individuals who died of COVID-19. All of the affected brain
    tissues exhibited foci of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in astrocytes. Infection of neural
    stem cell-derived astrocytes changed energy metabolism, altered key proteins and metabolites
    used to fuel neurons and for biogenesis of neurotransmitters, and elicited a secretory phenotype
    that reduces neuronal viability. Our data support the model where SARS-CoV-2 reaches the
    brain, infects astrocytes and triggers neuropathological changes that contribute to the structural
    and functional alterations in the brain of COVID-19 patients.
    Main text
              COVID-19 is a disease caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome
    coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although the most commonly observed symptoms of COVID-19
    are respiratory and related to pulmonary infection, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated
    that SARS-CoV-2 may have extrapulmonary effects 1​​ . Notably, over 30% of COVID-19 patients
    manifest neurological and even neuropsychiatric symptoms 2,3​                     ​ , eventually presenting some
    degree of encephalitis 4​​ . More than half of these patients continue to exhibit neurological
    symptoms even three months after the onset of the disease, when the virus is no longer detected
     . This is consistent with substantial damage to the nervous system 6​​ .

              To explore the extent of brain damage in COVID-19 patients, we performed cortical
    surface-based morphometry analysis using high-resolution 3T MRI of 81 subjects diagnosed
    with COVID-19 who had mild respiratory symptoms and did not require hospitalization or
    oxygen support. The analysis was performed within a median interval of 54 days after
    SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR and the subjects were compared to 145 healthy volunteers
    (Supplementary Table 1 and 2). The analysis revealed areas of reduced cortical thickness in the
    left lingual gyrus, calcarine sulcus - including the cuneus - and olfactory sulcus - including the
    rectus gyrus (Fig. 1a). In contrast, increased thickness was detected in the central sulcus -
    including the precentral and postcentral gyrus - and superior occipital gyrus (Fig. 1a), which can
    be associated with vasogenic edemas 7​​ . A subgroup of these individuals (n = 61) were subjected
    to neuropsychological evaluation for anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory, BAI), depression (Beck
    Depression Inventory, BDI), logical memory (Wechsler Memory Scale), cognitive functions
    (TRAIL Making Test) and fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire, CFQ). These tests were
    performed between 21 and 120 days after diagnosis (median of 59 days). Symptoms of anxiety
    were identified in approximately 28% of the subjects, and 20% of individuals presented
    symptoms of depression (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Abnormal performances were observed in
    nearly 28% of participants on logical memory and approximately 34% and 56% on TRAIL A
    and B, respectively (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1b). We also correlated the
    changes in cortex thickness with the neuropsychological evaluation. We identified a negative
    correlation between BAI and cortical thickness of orbitofrontal regions (adjusted for CFQ) (Fig.
    1b and Supplementary Table 4) and a positive correlation between TRAIL B and cortical
    thickness of the right gyrus rectus (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 5). We also found partial
    correlations between logical memory (immediate recall, adjusted for BAI, BDI and CFQ) and

    cortical thickness of regions associated with language (Supplementary Table 6). ​These results
    suggest that a thinner cortex in these areas is associated with poor performance on this verbal
    memory task. Ov​erall, our findings evidence major alterations in brain cortex structure
    associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms as a consequence of COVID-19.
              Brain alterations in COVID-19 patients could be a consequence of inflammatory or
    hemodynamic changes secondary to peripheral infection or could be caused by the ability of
    SARS-CoV-2 to invade the central nervous system (CNS) and compromise cell viability and
    brain function. Although exacerbated inflammation and cardiovascular dysfunction have been
    well characterized in COVID-19 patients 8​​ , infection of the CNS by SARS-CoV-2 remains under
    debate. We performed a minimally invasive autopsy via endonasal trans-ethmoidal access of
    brain samples from 26 individuals who died of COVID-19 and analyzed histopathological
    features. We found alterations consistent with necrosis and inflammation in 19% of the brain
    tissues from these individuos (5/20) (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Notably, SARS-CoV-2
    genetic material and spike protein was detected in all of these five samples (Fig. 2b,c).
    SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was found in about one third of the cells in one of the slices of brain
    tissue analyzed (Fig. 2d), the majority of these cells being astrocytes (Fig. 2e). We also found the
    virus in neurons (Supplementary Fig. 2b), but not in microglia (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The
    presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein correlated with the presence of double-stranded RNA
    (dsRNA) in the infected cells (Fig. 2f), indicating replicative virus in the brain tissue.
              We have also conducted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based
    shotgun proteomics with a different set of samples, consisting of 12 ​postmortem​ brain samples
    from COVID-19 patients vs. 8 SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. We identified 119 differentially
    expressed proteins with the most highly enriched pathways being associated with

    neurodegenerative diseases and carbon metabolism (Fig. 2g). Moreover, astrocyte proteins were
    enriched among the differentially expressed proteins, consistent with the higher frequency of
    infected astrocytes (Fig. 2h).
              In order to investigate the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on astrocytes, we
    generated human neural stem cell-derived astrocytes, exposed them to the virus for 1h, and
    analyzed cell response after 24h. We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect human
    astrocytes (Fig. 3a-c). Notably, we also found the presence of dsRNA in SARS-CoV-2-infected
    astrocytes i​n vitro​, but not in mock control cells (Fig. 3a-c). Altogether these results indicate that
    astrocytes are permissive cells for SARS-CoV-2 infection and represent a site for virus
    replication in the central nervous system.
              In an attempt to identify downstream mechanisms triggered by SARS-CoV2 infection
    and possibly involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, we employed an unbiased
    proteomic analysis of infected astrocytes. LC/MS-based proteomics revealed 233 differentially
    expressed proteins in SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes compared to mock control cells. A group
    of approximately 50 proteins formed a molecular signature which distinguished infected
    astrocytes from controls (Fig. 4a). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that these proteins are
    involved in a wide range of biological processes (Fig. 4b). When we compared these pathways to
    those normally enriched in brain proteomics, we found carbon metabolism,
    glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, biosynthesis of amino acids, pentose phosphate pathway and
    necroptosis in common (Fig. 4c). In agreement, LC/MS-based metabolomic analysis of
    SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes showed marked changes in metabolic intermediates of
    glycolysis, the TCA cycle and anaplerotic reactions, indicating extensive remodeling of astrocyte
    metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 3). This phenomenon was marked by the decrease in pyruvate

    and lactate, which are downstream metabolites of the glycolytic pathway, as well as a reduction
    in glutamine and intermediates of glutamine metabolism such as glutamate, GABA and
    alpha-ketoglutarate (Fig. 4d). Astrocyte bioenergetics were further characterized by Seahorse
    Extracellular Flux analysis, showing increased respiration in infected cells (Fig. 4e and
    Supplementary Fig. 4). Together, these results demonstrate increased metabolic activity in
    SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes and a reduction of metabolites used by these cells to support
    neuronal metabolism.
              These observations prompted us to investigate whether neuronal viability could be
    indirectly affected by infection of astrocytes with SARS-CoV-2. To test that, we cultured
    differentiated SH-SY5Y​ neurons with the conditioned medium of S​ARS-CoV-2-infected
    astrocytes. SH-SY5Y cells are more closely related to adrenergic neurons, but they also express
    dopaminergic markers 9​​ . As observed in Fig. 4f, conditioned medium of ​S​ARS-CoV2-infected
    astrocytes induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y neurons. These results suggest that the infection of
    astrocytes by SARS-CoV-2 might be a trigger event to reduce neuronal viability.
              This study and other reports showing alterations in brain structure and the manifestation
    of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients 10,11​                ​    have raised a debate on whether these
    clinical features are consequence of peripheral changes or rather the potential ability of the virus
    to invade the CNS. Our findings support the latter, at least in part, as we found SARS-CoV-2 in
    the brain tissue collected from patients who died of COVID-19. The potential of SARS-CoV-2 to
    infect brain cells has been demonstrated using ​in vitro ​models such as stem cell-derived neural
    cells and cerebral organoids 12​          ​ . Viral particles have also been found in the brain 13​        ​ , localized in
    the microvasculature and in neurons 12​              ​ , as well as in the choroid plexus​14​ and meninges 15​       ​ .
    However, the magnitude of this infection and its distribution in the brain tissue had not been

    demonstrated. We show that SARS-CoV-2 may infect almost one third of the cells in the brain
    and the majority of these cells are astrocytes.
              In astrocytes, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in marked changes in cellular metabolism.
    Since astrocyte metabolism is key to support neuronal function, we hypothesized that these
    changes could indirectly impact neurons. Astrocytes support neurons metabolically by exporting
             ​ . One of the most critical alterations caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in astrocytes is
    lactate 16​
    the decrease in pyruvate and lactate levels. In spite of these intracellular changes, lactate is not
    altered in the conditioned medium of SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5),
    suggesting that infected astrocytes divert pyruvate to lactate production and export it to preserve
    neuronal metabolism; however, in order to sustain its own metabolism, carbon sources other than
    the ones derived from glucose would have to be used to fuel the TCA cycle. Supporting this
    notion, intermediates of glutamine metabolism such as glutamate and GABA are decreased in
    SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes, suggesting that glutaminolysis is being used as an alternative
    source of carbons to fuel astrocyte oxidative metabolism. Importantly, astrocyte-derived
    glutamine is required for neuronal synthesis of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA 17​                               ​ .
    Astrocytes play a vital role in neurotransmitter recycling, a crucial process for the maintenance
    of synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. This is especially important for glutamatergic
    synapses since proper glutamate uptake by astroglia prevents the occurrence of excitotoxicity 18​                              ​ .
    Upon this uptake, glutamine synthetase converts glutamate to glutamine, which can then be
    transferred back to neurons, thus closing the glutamate-glutamine cycle. This is also true for
    GABAergic synapses, where the neurotransmitter GABA is taken up by astrocytes and
    metabolized first to glutamate and then to glutamine 19​                ​ . Moreover, astrocytes are responsible for
    maintaining glutamate levels in the brain. Hence, given the importance of the coupling between

    astrocytes and neurons, astrocytic alterations in glutamine metabolism are expected to
    compromise neuronal function, affecting synaptic function and plasticity 20​                        ​ .
              We also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits a secretory phenotype in astrocytes that
    results in increased neuronal apoptosis. Neuronal death may explain, at least partially, the
    alterations in cortical thickness found in COVID-19 patients. A recent study with 60 recovered
    patients and 39 healthy controls also identified gray matter abnormalities 97 days after the onset
    of the disease, with increased volume in some areas of the brain 5​​ . While that study analyzed
    hospitalized patients, we evaluated individuals that did not have to be hospitalized (i.e. had mild
    respiratory symptoms), and nevertheless, we observed notable alterations of cortical thickness.
    Importantly, some of these alterations correlated with symptoms of anxiety and impaired
    cognition, which is consistent with previous literature 21,22​            ​ . Since one of the hypotheses for the
    neuroinvasive mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is via the olfactory nerves​ ​23​, we speculate that the
    associations between BAI and TRAIL B scores and structural alterations in the orbitofrontal
    region may be a result of the action of the virus in this cortical area, closely related to the
    olfactory nerves.
              Our findings are consistent with a model in which SARS-CoV-2 is able to reach the
    central nervous system of COVID-19 patients, infects astrocytes and secondarily impairs
    neuronal function and viability. These changes are likely to contribute to the alterations of brain
    structure as observed here and elsewhere, thereby resulting in the neurological and
    neuropsychiatric symptoms manifested by some COVID-19 patients. Our study comes as a
    cautionary note that interventions directed to treat COVID-19 should also envision ways to
    prevent SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the CNS and/or replication in astrocytes.

    approved by the local Ethics Committee. These individuals presented mild symptoms during the
    acute phase and did not require hospitalization or oxygen therapy. They had a median interval of
    54 days (range 16-120 days) between their RT-PCR exam and the day of MRI scanning and
    interview. For cortical thickness analysis, we included one hundred and forty-five controls (103
    women, median 38 years of age) 24​              ​ from our Neuroimaging databank, given the difficulties and
    risk of recruiting healthy volunteers during the pandemic. The outpatients and healthy controls
    were balanced for age (p=0.45) and sex (p=0.65). The neuropsychological evaluations and
    neuroimaging analyses were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of
    Campinas (CAAE: 31556920.0.0000.5404) and all subjects signed a consent form to participate.
    Neuropsychological evaluation
              We performed neuropsychological evaluations of sixty-one of these patients. They were
    tested for symptoms of anxiety using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and symptoms of
    depression using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) 25​                    ​ . Symptoms of anxiety were confirmed
    for those with a BAI higher than 10 points, and depression symptoms defined for those with
    minimum of 14 points on the BDI. In terms of depression, subjects were categorized with mild

    (BDI 14-19), moderate (20-35) and severe (36-63) symptoms. Anxiety symptoms were
    considered mild (BAI 11-19), moderate (20-30) and severe (31-63). We evaluated verbal
    memory (immediate and delayed episodic memory) using the Logical Memory subtest from the
    Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-R) 26​                   ​ , in which the examiner verbally presents two stories, and
    each story includes 25 pertinent pieces of information. Subjects are required to recall details of
    each story immediately after its presentation and again after 20 minutes. To evaluate other
    cognitive functions, we applied the TRAIL Making Test (TMT) , which is subdivided into two
    steps. ​Step A​ assesses processing speed and visual search in a task that requires ascending
    connection order of 25 numbers, randomly arranged. ​Step B​ evaluates alternating attention and
    cognitive flexibility in a task associated with shifting rules in an ascending sequence of 25
    numbers. A training stage is applied to both steps. We calculated z-scores for the results of these
    tests based on Brazilian normative data 26,27​           ​ . For each test, the function was categorized as:
    “preserved” if the z-score was higher than -0.99; “below average” when the z-score was between
    -1 and -1.49; “minor impairment” if the z-score was between -1.5 and -1.99; and “major
    impairment” for z-score values equal to or lower than -2. The Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire
    (CFQ-11) 28​  ​ was used to evaluate fatigue in these subjects; they were instructed to answer 11
    questions (measured on a Likert scale 0-3), which yields a global score out of 33.
    Neuroimaging analysis
              We obtained the structural, 3D, T1-weighted images from a 3T Achieva-Philips MRI
    scanner (voxel size: 1x1x1 mm, TE = 3.2 ms, TR = 7 ms, matrix = 240x240x180, flip angle = 8
    and FOV = 240x240 mm2) ​24,25​. We performed imaging analysis with the CAT12 toolbox
    (​http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/​, version r1711) within SPM12

    Thickness (CT) maps, according to the default parameters. The T1 images were initially spatially
    registered and segmented into gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. Finally, we
    calculated the cortical thickness using the projection method described by Dahnke et al. 29​                           ​ . For
    voxelwise analysis of extracted maps, we used CAT12/SPM12 tools for an independent T-test
    (comparing COVID-19 patients and healthy controls), including age and sex as covariates. The
    results displayed were corrected for multiple comparisons using False Discovery Rate (FDR) 30                                   ​
    correction (p<0.05). For anatomical identification, we used the “Destrieux Atlas 2009” 31​                           ​ .
    Cortical parcellation was performed with standard CAT12 tools to extract the cortical thickness
    of regions of interest for correlations with neuropsychological scores. We used SPSS 22 for
    statistical analysis of clinical and neuropsychological variables. The FDR procedure was applied
    to adjust p-values for multiple comparisons (when necessary) with R software 32​                         ​ .
    Postmortem brain samples from COVID-19
              Twenty-six individuals who died from complications related to COVID-19 were
    autopsied with an ultrasound-guided, minimally invasive approach using ​endonasal
    trans-ethmoidal access​. Brain tissue samples were collected and fixed using a 10% neutral
    buffered formalin solution. After fixation, the tissue was embedded in a paraffin block and
    sectioned into slices with a thickness of 3 μm. The sections were stained by H&E and
    immunofluorescence. For proteomic analysis, twelve COVID-19 patients were autopsied using
    the same approach. Brain tissue samples were collected and macerated in lysis buffer (100 mM
    Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) prior to trypsin digestion.
    The autopsy studies were approved by the National Commission for Research Ethics (CAAE:
    32475220.5.0000.5440 and CAAE: 38071420.0.1001.5404).

    Generation of human astrocytes (hES-derived)
              Differentiation of glial progenitor cells was performed from neural stem cells (NSC)
    derived from pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hES, cell line BR-1) 33​                          ​ , according to the
    method published by Trindade, 2020 34​                ​ . NSCs were cultured in plates coated with Geltrex Matrix
    (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) using 1:1 Neurobasal™/Advanced DMEM/F12 medium
    and 2% neural induction supplement. Upon reaching 50% confluence, the medium was changed
    to DMEM/F12, 1% N2 supplement, 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1%
    Penicillin-Streptomycin and maintained at 37°C in humidified air with 5% CO​2​ for 21 days. At
    this stage, cells were considered glial progenitor cells (GPCs). Subsequently, GPCs were plated
    at low density (30-40% confluence) on Geltrex coated plates and treated with DMEM/F12
    medium, 1% GlutaMAX Supplement, 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The
    differentiation medium was replaced every 2-3 days. After 4 weeks of differentiation, the cells
    were considered mature astrocytes. The cells were plated on Geltrex-coated coverslips at a
    density of 4x10​4​ cells for immunostaining assays; and 25x10​4 ​cells for viral load, proteomic and
    metabolomic analysis. All products used for cell culture are from Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA,

    supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% of penicillin and streptomycin, and
    incubated at 37°C with 5% CO​2​ atmosphere. Viral titer was determined by the plaque-forming
    assay using Vero cells.
    In vitro​ infection
              Astrocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour using an MOI of 0.1 (proteomics,
    metabolomics, gene expression, viral load, bioenergetics assays and flow cytometer analysis) and
    1 (immunostaining experiments) under gentle agitation at room temperature. After viral
    adsorption, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with
    DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% GlutaMAX and 1% penicillin and streptomycin
    for 24 hours at standard culture conditions (37ºC and 5% CO​2​ atmosphere). Astrocytes cells were
    harvested according to the experiment: immunostaining, proteomics and metabolomic analysis,
    gene expression analysis and viral load, bioenergetics test and flow cytometer analysis.
     Immunostaining and confocal microscopy
              Brain sections from autopsies and astrocyte cell cultures were fixed with 10% neutral

    DAPI (Life Technologies; cat. D1306; 1:1,000). Images were acquired by an Axio Observer
    combined with an LSM 780 confocal device (Carl Zeiss) with 630x magnification and Z-stack
    (0.15μm) for brain sections. Colocalization analysis between GFAP and SARS-CoV-2 S1 or
    GFAP and dsRNA were quantified using the Fiji/ImageJ software. To determine colocalization,
    we used a ratio of GFAP:SARS-CoV-2 and GFAP:dsRNA in each sample by analyzing
    Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
    Proteomics sample preparation, LC-MS/MS analysis and data processing
              Astrocytes infected with SARS-CoV-2 and a mock control were collected in biological
    triplicates. Cells were chemically lysed with Lysis Buffer: (100 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 150
    mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X, protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and mechanically lysed with an
    ultrasonication probe in 3 cycles of 20s each with 90% of frequency. The total protein extract
    was quantified by BCA, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
    MA, USA). 30 µg of total protein extract from each sample was transferred to a Microcon-10
    Centrifugal Filter, with 10 kDa cutoff, for FASP protein digestion 35​                    ​ . Proteins were reduced (10

    ammonium bicarbonate (AmBic), pH 8.0. One the following day, trypsin activity was quenched
    by adding formic acid (FA) to a final concentration of 1% (v/v) and the peptides were recovered
    from the filter in 50 mM AmBic, concentrated in a SpeedVac and stored at -80°C until use.
    Digested peptides were resuspended in 0.1% FA. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed in an
    ACQUITY M-Class System (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) coupled online to a Synapt
    G2-Si mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). 1 μg of peptides were loaded onto
    a trapping column (Symmetry C18 5 μm, 180 μm × 20 mm, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA)
    and subsequently separated in the analytical column (HSS T3 C18 1.8 μm, 75 μm × 150 mm;
    Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). For gradient elution, 0.1% FA was used as eluent A and
    Acetonitrile-FA (99.9% ACN:0.1% FA) as eluent B. Reversed phase gradient was carried out
    over 120 minutes, with a linear gradient 3 - 60% acetonitrile over 90 min at 300 nL/min. In the
    Synapt G2-Si, the peptide spectra were acquired by ion mobility-enhanced data-independent
    acquisition (HDMS​e​). Mass spectrometry analysis was performed in “Resolution Mode”,
    switching between low (4 eV) and high (25–60 eV) collision energies, using a scan time of 1.0 s
    per function over 50–2000 m/z. The wave velocity for ion mobility separation was 1.000 m/s and
    the transfer wave velocity was 175 m/s. A [Glu1]-Fibrinopeptide B Standard (Waters
    Corporation, Milford, MA) was used as the reference lock mass compound. Each sample was run
    in three technical replicates.
              The raw data from each experiment were processed in Progenesis QI for proteomics
    (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). Tandem mass spectra were searched against the ​Homo
    sapiens​ proteome database (UNIPROT Protein reviewed release 2020-04), using tolerance
    parameters of 20 ppm for precursor ions and 10 ppm for product ions. For peptide identification,
    carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification, oxidation of methionines as a

    identification was performed using a minimum of 1 fragment ion matched per peptide, a
    minimum of 3 fragment ions per protein and a minimum of 1 peptide per protein.
    Label-free quantitative analysis was carried out using the relative abundance intensity
    normalized by all peptides identified. The expression analysis was performed considering the
    technical replicates for each experimental condition, following the hypothesis that each group is
    independent. Proteins with ANOVA (p) ≤ 0.05 between the groups were considered
    differentially expressed.
    Metabolomics sample preparation, UPLC-MS/MS analysis and data processing
              The medium was washed twice with PBS at physiologic pH, then the cells (10​6​) were
    collected with 600 μL of methanol. Samples were dried and stored at -80 °C until the metabolite
    extraction step. Volumes of 473 μL of water, 600 μL of methanol, and 1168 μL of chloroform
    were added, and then the tubes were shaken vigorously for 2 minutes. Subsequently, samples
    were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 13,000 x g. The aqueous supernatant and the organic phase
    (lower phase) were collected and dried for 60 and 40 min (respectively) in a vacuum
    concentrator. All samples were stored at -80 °C until analysis by UPLC-MS/MS.
              The samples were resuspended in 100 μL of methanol: water mixture (1:1) and for each
    analysis, 4 μL of the sample was injected. Sample separation was performed by hydrophobic
    interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) using an Acquity UPLC® BEH amide column (1.7
    µm, 2.1 mm x 100 mm). The mobile phases used for the separations were ACN: H​2​O (80:20) as
    mobile phase A and ACN: H​2​O (30:70) as mobile phase B, both phases containing 10 mM of
    ammonium formate and 0.1% of ammonium hydroxide. The separation was then performed by a

    min for re-equilibration before the next injection for a total run time of 10 min. Data acquisition
    was performed in negative mode and the instrument was operated in MS​e​ mode in the m/z range
    of 50–800 Da, with an acquisition time of 0.1 s per scan.
              The raw files were preprocessed by Progenesis QI software by Waters®, and
    identification was executed using multiple data banks. Identification of the metabolites of
    interest was carried out manually by spectral features, and the identification level 3 was obtained
    according to Schrimpe-Rutledge et al. 36​               ​ using 5ppm as the error cutoff. The integration area of
    ​each peak was used to calculate the violin plot graph and an unpaired t-test with Welch's
     correction was used for statistical comparison. All analysis were performed using GraphPad
     Prism 8.0 software (San Diego, CA, USA) and a significance level of p ≤ 0.05 was adopted.
     RNA extraction, gene expression analysis and viral load
              Total RNA extraction was performed using TRI Reagent according to the manufacturer’s
     instructions (Sigma, St Louis, USA). RNA concentration was determined by a DeNovix
     spectrophotometer and RNA integrity was assessed by visualization of 28S and 18S ribosomal

    specificity, a melting curve analysis was performed by heating samples from 65°C to 99°C (1°C
    increment changes at 5s intervals). All sample measurements were performed in duplicate.
    Primers were designed with PrimerBlast ​and used at the concentration of ​200 nM. Data were
    normalized to the expression of 18S (Fwd 5’ CCCAACTTCTTAGAGGGACAAG 3’; Rev 5’
    CATCTAAGGGCATCACAGACC 3’) and the relative quantification value of each target gene
    was determined using a comparative CT method 37​                    ​ . For virus detection, SARS-CoV-2
    nucleocapsid N1 primers were used as previously described (Fwd 5’

              Astrocytes were plated on Seahorse XF-24 plates at a density of 1.5x10​4​ cells per well
    and incubated in complete culture medium for two days at 37°C in 5% CO​2​. 24 hours before the
    experiment, cells were either infected by SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.1) or not infected (MOCK). One
    day post-infection, the culture medium was changed to Seahorse Base medium (supplemented
    with 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, and 10 mM glucose) and cells were incubated at 37°C in
    a non-CO​2​ incubator for 1 hour. OCR (Oxygen Consumption Rate) was measured over the
    course of the experiment under basal conditions and after the injections of oligomycin (1 µM),
    FCCP (5 µM) and antimycin A/rotenone (100 nM/1 µM). Protein concentration was determined

    SH-SY5Y culture in astrocytes conditioned medium
              Astrocytes and SH-SY5Y cells were cultured separately in standard conditions until
    complete differentiation. Next, astrocytes were infected either with MOCK or SARS-CoV-2
    (MOI 0.1) and after 24 hours, the medium was removed and cells were washed with PBS and
    cultured for 24 hours. The SH-SY5Y medium was removed and replaced by
    astrocyte-conditioned medium and cells were incubated for 24 hours. After incubation, cells and
    the medium were collected for Flow Cytometer Analysis, following the described procedure
    below.
    Flow cytometer analysis
              SH-SY5Y cell viability was determined 24 h after incubation with astrocyte-conditioned
    medium. The percentage of live cells (Apotracker-/FVS510-) or early (Apotracker+/FVS510-)
    and late (Apotracker+/FVS510+) apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry
    (FACSymphony -Becton & Dickinson, San Diego, CA, USA), after labeling with fixable
    viability stain (FVS510, BD Biosciences, #564406) and ApotrackerTM Green (BioLegend,
    #427403). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (BD Biosciences). Data are representative
    of at least two independent experiments performed in triplicate and are shown as mean ± SEM. P
    values were determined by ANOVA one-way followed by Tukey’s post hoc test.

    Lactate assay
              Astrocyte supernatants from infected or non-infected cells were collected and
    deproteinized using 1 M perchloric acid (PCA) for 1 hour. Protein precipitation was performed
    by centrifugation at 18,000 xg for 5 minutes. pH was neutralized using KOH and lactate
    concentration was determined using a colorimetric L-lactate assay kit (cat. no. 138; Labtest).
    Data were expressed as mean ± SEM of at least two independent experiments performed in
    triplicate. Statistical significance was calculated by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test. All
    analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (San Diego, CA, USA) and a
    significance level of p ≤ 0.05 was adopted.

    SARS-CoV-2 infected astrocytes vs. mock. The integration area of ​each peak was used to
    calculate the violin plot graph and unpaired t-test with Welch's correction was used for statistical
    comparison. e)​ ​Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of SARS-CoV-2 infected astrocytes vs. mock.
    SeaHorse Flux Analysis using the MitoStress test where basal respiration was measured followed
    by determination of oligomycin-, FCCP-, and rotenone/antimycin-induced respiration. f)​ ​Human
    neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y was cultured for 24 h in the presence of astrocyte-conditioned media
    (ACM) from mock or SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) infected cells. Representative histograms of cell
    apoptosis as measured by ApotrackerGreen staining. Data are representative of at least two
    independent experiments performed in triplicate (flow cytometry and metabolomics analysis) or
    quintuplicate (SeaHorse Flux Analysis), and shown as mean ± SEM. P values were determined
    by two-tailed unpaired with Welch's correction (c and d) and one-way ANOVA followed by
    Tukey’s post hoc test (e). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; **** P < 0.0001 compared to mock, and #P <
    0.05 compared to CoV-2 (ACM+).
    Supplementary Fig. 1:​ ​Frequency of individuals with neuropsychological symptoms. ​The
    subgroup of individuals who performed neuropsychological evaluation presented a median age
    of 37.8 years (range 21-63 years), 16 years of education (range 6-24 years), and 59 days of the
    interval from their diagnosis of COVID-19 (range 21-120 days). The median values of BDI
    (range 0-36), and also of BAI (0-45) were 6 points. The median score of CFQ-11 was 16 (range
    0-32).​ ​a) Presence of anxiety (BAI) and depression (BDI) symptoms. b) Performance on the
    logical memory (LM) test (Wechsler Memory Scale) and cognitive function tests (TRAIL
    Making Test A and B).
