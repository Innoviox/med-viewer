    Abstract
    CMR is considered the gold standard for measuring heart function, including cardiac
    volumes and mass. Further, in a single CMR exam, information about cardiac function,
    structure, tissue composition, and blood flow could be obtained. Nevertheless, CMR is
    underutilized due to long scanning times, the need for multiple breath-holds, use of a
    contrast agent, and relatively higher cost compared to echocardiography.
              In this study, we propose a rapid CMR exam based on recent developments in
    imaging sequences. The proposed exam is both rapid and provides comprehensive
                                                                         1

    cardiovascular information without the need for a contrast agent or multiple breath-
    holds. The developed exam includes advanced sequences for evaluating global and
    regional cardiac functions, myocardial tissue characterization, and flow hemodynamics
    in the heart, valves, and large vessels. Time-consuming conventional sequences have
    been replaced by advanced sequences, which resulted in reducing scan time from > 1
    hour with conventional CMR exam to <20 minutes with the proposed rapid CMR exam.
    Specifically, conventional two-dimensional (2D) cine and phase-contrast (PC)
    sequences have been replaced by optimized three-dimensional (3D)-cine and four-
    dimensional (4D)-flow sequences, respectively. Compared to 2D cine imaging that
    requires 12-16 separate breath-holds, the implemented 3D-cine sequence allows for
    whole heart coverage in 1-2 breath-holds; thus, reducing scan time by 80-90%.
    Similarly, compared to 2D PC flow imaging that requires multiple breath-holds and the
    presence of an experienced cardiac operator for precise prescription of the imaging
    planes, the implemented 4D-flow sequence allows for whole-chest coverage in ~10-
    minute, free-breathing acquisition without the need for a navigator echo, which makes
    scan time independent of the patient’s breathing pattern. Furthermore, conventional
    myocardial tagging has been replaced by the fast strain-encoding (SENC) sequence,
    which reduces scan time from one slice per breath-hold to only one slice per heartbeat
    (~1 second). Finally, T1 and T2 mapping sequences are included in this proposed
    exam, which allow for myocardial tissue characterization without the need for contrast.
    The proposed rapid exam has been tested on volunteers and measurements showed
    good agreement with those from conventional sequences despite the significant
    reduction in scan time.

              In conclusion, we propose a rapid, contrast-free, and comprehensive
    cardiovascular exam that does not require repeated breath-holds or a cardiac
    experienced operator to run the exam, which would result in improving cost
    effectiveness of CMR and increasing its adoption in clinical practice.

    Background
    CMR is considered the gold standard for measuring heart function, including cardiac
    volumes and mass (1-4). Furthermore, in a single CMR exam, information about cardiac
    function, structure, tissue composition, and blood flow could be obtained. Compared to
    echocardiography, CMR has higher reproducibility, more accuracy, and is not affected
    by the acoustic window, geometric assumptions, or operator’s skills (5). Nevertheless,
    CMR is underutilized due to long scanning times, the need for multiple breath-holds, the
    use of a contrast agent, and relatively higher cost compared to echocardiography (6).
    In this study, we propose a rapid CMR exam based on recent developments in imaging
    sequences. The proposed exam is both rapid and provides comprehensive
    cardiovascular information without the need for contrast or multiple breath-holds, which
    makes it cost-effective and allows for routine adoption in clinical practice. The proposed
    exam includes advanced sequences for evaluating global and regional cardiac
    functions, myocardial tissue characterization, as well as flow hemodynamics in the
                                                                        3

    heart, valves, and large vessels. The information from different sequences complement
    each other to provide a complete picture about heart health. Time-consuming
    conventional sequences are replaced in the proposed exam by advanced sequences
    that are mostly free-breathing or real-time and do not require breath-holding, which
    resulted in total scan time of less than 20 minutes, versus more than 1 hour for
    conventional CMR.
    Cine imaging is an essential part of almost every CMR exam, which is used to evaluate
    heart function based on basic cardiovascular parameters such as volumes, mass, and
    ejection fraction (EF) (3). Nevertheless, conventional cine imaging requires long scan
    times due to the need to acquire a stack of short-axis (SAX) slices (typically 12-16
    slices) that covers the whole heart, in addition to other long-axis (LAX) slices. As cine
    slices are typically acquired one slice per breath-hold, acquiring all cine images in this
    conventional fashion consumes a considerable amount of scan time. In the proposed
    rapid exam, we replaced conventional breath-holding 2D cine imaging with a single 3D-
    cine      scan (7, 8) based on recent developments in acquisition and reconstruction
    techniques (9-12), which require only 1-2 breath-holds and result in 80-90% savings in
    scan time compared to 2D acquisition. We further evaluated the effects of different
    imaging acquisition strategies on image quality and resulting clinical measurements in
    volunteer scans.
    CMR blood flow imaging is essential in certain applications, e.g. in valvular and
    congenital heart diseases. It also provides important information about hemodynamic
                                                                        4

    patterns, diastolic function, and vessel wall stiffness in different cardiovascular
    diseases. Typically, 2D phase-contrast (PC) sequences are used for flow imaging,
    where each slice is imaged in a separate breath-hold, which results in long scan time
    with the possibility of scan repetitions to adjust slice positioning as accurate plane
    prescription is necessary for quantitative flow analysis. In the proposed exam, 2D PC
    flow imaging was replaced by an advanced 4D-flow imaging (13, 14) based on recent
    developments in acquisition and reconstruction techniques (9, 12), which allows for
    free-breathing acquisition, whole-chest coverage, and inline image reconstruction in ~10
    minutes, independent of the patient’s breathing pattern. This approach significantly
    reduces scan time and allows for measuring flow and other derivative parameters at any
    location in the acquired volume without the need to repeat scans. In this study, we
    compared flow measurements from 4D-flow acquisition to those from conventional 2D
    PC flow imaging at different locations.
    Measuring regional cardiac function parameters, e.g. myocardial strain, showed to be
    valuable for early detection of subclinical cardiac dysfunction before global function, e.g.
    EF, is affected (15, 16). CMR tagging is typically used for strain imaging (17, 18).
    Nevertheless, the tagging sequence requires a separate breath-hold for each acquired
    slice, which makes it time consuming. Further, the resulting tagged images have limited
    spatial resolution, depending on tags separation, and requires specialized analysis
    software. In the proposed exam, CMR tagging was replaced by fast strain-encoding
    (SENC) imaging (19, 20), which has been previously validated against conventional
    tagging in several studies (21). Compared to CMR tagging, SENC imaging has the
                                                                        5

    following advantages: 1) real-time (one slice per heartbeat) acquisition; 2) high spatial
    resolution on the pixel level; 3) instant, simple post-processing that results in color-
    coded strain maps. Replacing tagging with SENC results in significant saving in scan
    time.
    Finally, the proposed exam includes T1 and T2 mapping (22, 23) sequences for
    myocardial tissue characterization. The advantages of these techniques are that they
    provide quantitative measurements of myocardial T1 and T2 relaxation parameters
    without the need for a contrast agent. Elevated T1 and T2 values have been previously
    shown to be associated with the presence of tissue fibrosis and edema, respectively
    (22, 24).
    Methods
    Human studies were conducted with approval of our Institutional Review Board. Two
    healthy subjects were scanned using both the proposed rapid exam and conventional
    CMR sequences on a GE 3T Premier MRI scanner (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI)
    equipped with 32-channel phased-array coil. The proposed rapid CMR exam included
    the following sequences: 3D-cine (full heart coverage in 1-2 breath-holds), navigator-
    echo-free 4D-flow (whole-chest coverage in ~10 minutes of free-breathing), SENC (3
    SAX and 3 LAX slices obtained in 6 heartbeats without breathing holding), and T1
    (Modified Look-Locker (MOLLI)) (25) and T2 (multi-echo fast spin echo (MEFSE))
    mappings, with same coverage as in SENC imaging.

    The implemented 3D cine imaging technique included a number of acquisition and
    reconstruction developments, including variable-density k-t sampling (12) and kat ARC
    acceleration (Autocalibrating Reconstruction for Cartesian Sampling with k- & Adaptive-
    t-space data synthesis; a spatiotemporal correlation-based auto-calibrating parallel
    imaging method) (9-11). The technique allows for achieving an acceleration factor of 9
    and whole-heart imaging in 1-2 breath-holds. The following whole-heart coverage
    acquisition strategies were implemented: 1) CONV: conventional 2D cine acquisition
    with SAX slices acquired in separate breath-holds; 2) 2-SAX: two overlapping 3D-cine
    slabs acquired in the SAX direction in two breath-holds; 3) 1-SAX: one 3D-cine thick
    slab acquired in the SAX direction in a single breath-hold; 4) 2-AXIAL: two overlapping
    3D-cine slabs acquired in the axial direction (with almost isotropic resolution) in two
    breath-holds; and 5) 1-AXIAL: one 3D-cine thick slab acquired in the axial direction (with
    almost isotropic resolution) in a single breath-hold. The imaging parameters for 2D cine
    imaging were: repetition time (TR) = 3.6 ms, echo time (TE) = 1.3 ms, flip angle = 55°,
    views per segment = 14. The imaging parameters for 3D-cine sequence were: TR = 3
    ms, TE = 1.2 ms, flip angle = 40°, views per segment = 20. Both 2D cine and 3D-cine
    sequences were obtained with Fast Imaging Employing Steady-state Acquisition
    (FIESTA) acquisition, number of averages = 1, and readout bandwidth = 488 Hz/pixel.
    Additional information about spatial and temporal resolutions of different acquisitions is
    shown in Table 1.

    myocardium contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was measured as the ratio between the
    mean blood-to-myocardial signal intensity difference and background SD. The cine
    images were processed using the cvi42 software (Circle Cardiovascular Imaging,
    Calgary, Canada). The AXIAL datasets were reformatted to generate a stack of SAX
    and LAX slices. The SAX and LAX images from different acquisition scenarios were
    semi-automatically processed to measure left ventricular (LV) volumes, mass, EF, and
    wall thickness of different heart segments based on the American Heart Association
    (AHA) 17-segment model.
    The implemented 4D-flow imaging technique included a number of acquisition and
    reconstruction developments, including variable-density k-t sampling (increasing signal
    averaging at the k-space center) for acquisition-efficient motion suppression (12), kat
    ARC acceleration (9), and overlapping multi-slab acquisition for inflow blood signal
    enhancement without using a contrast agent. The technique allows for achieving an
    acceleration factor of 8, which allows for navigator-echo-free, whole-chest coverage in
    ~10 minutes. The 4D-flow imaging parameters were as follows: 3D time-resolved
    gradient echo sequence, 3 slabs with 32 location per slab and 5 overlapping locations
    between adjacent slabs, matrix = 180x180, field of view (FOV) = 360x360 mm2, spatial
    resolution = 2x2x2.4 mm3, views per segment = 4, number of heart phases = 20, flip
    angle = 8°, readout bandwidth = 488 Hz/pixel, acceleration factor = 8, velocity-encoding
    (venc) = 160 cm/s, and number of reconstructed images ~12,500. Conventional 2D PC
    flow images were acquired at seven locations (for comparison with 4D-flow): ascending
    aorta, proximal and distal descending aorta, main and right pulmonary arteries, and
                                                                        8

    mitral and tricuspid valves. The 2D PC flow imaging parameters were as follows:
    gradient echo sequence, TR = 6 ms, TE = 3.8 ms, matrix = 192x160, FOV = 360x360
    mm2, slice thickness = 6 mm, readout bandwidth = 488 Hz/pixel, flip angle = 25°, views
    per segment = 6, venc = 160 cm/s, number of heart phases = 30, and breath-holding
    time (not including recovery time in-between repeated breath-holds) = 15 s per slice.
    The 2D PC and 4D-flow images were processed using the cvi42 software, where the 4D-
    flow images were analyzed to measure blood flow at the same planes acquired with the
    2D PC flow imaging sequence. The 4D-flow images were analyzed on a DELL Precision
    7540 mobile workstation (laptop) equipped with 8-core Xeon processor, 128 GB RAM,
    and NVIDIA Quadro RTX 3000 card, which resulted in streamlined analysis without
    noticeable time lags. The following parameters were measured at different locations:
    blood flow, velocity, volume, vascular pressure gradient, valvular regurgitation fraction,
    forward flow time, and ventricular early-to-atrial filling ratio (E/A) in the left and right
    ventricles.
    SENC imaging is based on modulating the magnetization in the through-plane (slice
    selection) direction and then acquiring two sets of time-resolved images with different
    demodulation frequencies, from which tissue strain in the through-plane direction can be
    measured (19). The implemented SENC sequence included a number of techniques
    that allowed for reducing scan time to one slice per heartbeat, including: localized
    excitation, spiral readout, and interleaved image acquisition (20). Localized excitation is
    implemented by replacing one of the modulation hard radiofrequency (RF) pulses by a
                                                                        9

    slice-selective pulse in the phase-encoding direction in order to reduce the excited FOV,
    and thus use a smaller acquisition FOV (and matrix) to accelerate acquisition without
    introducing aliasing artifacts. Interleaved spiral acquisition is implemented for data
    readout, where 4 interleaved spirals, each is 8ms long, are used instead of conventional
    cartesian readout. Finally, the two sets of demodulated images (called low-tuning (LT)
    and high-tuning (HT) images, which acquire data at low-frequency and high-frequency,
    respectively) are acquired in an interleaved fashion in a single heartbeat. The SENC
    imaging parameters were as follows: TR = 8 ms, TE = 4 ms, flip angle = 20°, slice
    thickness = 8 mm, matrix = 64×64, reduced FOV = 250×250 mm2, number of averages
    = 1, readout bandwidth = 977 Hz/pixel, temporal resolution = 32 ms. The SENC images
    were processed using the MyoStrain software (Myocardial Solutions, Inc, Morristown,
    NC) to measure circumferential (Ecc) and longitudinal (Ell) strains. Conventional tagging
    images were acquired for reference with the following imaging parameters: TR = 5.7
    ms, TE = 3.1 ms, flip angle = 8°, slice thickness = 7 mm, matrix = 212×192, FOV =
    360×360 mm2, number of averages = 1, readout bandwidth = 391 Hz/pixel, tag spacing
    = 7 mm, # heart phases = 30.
    The imaging parameters of the MOLLI T1 mapping sequence were as follows: 8 images
    acquired using the 5(3s)3 acquisition pattern, FIESTA sequence, TR = 2.9 ms, TE = 1.3
    ms, flip angle = 35°, slice thickness = 8 mm, matrix = 160×148, FOV = 360×360 mm2,
    number of averages = 1, and readout bandwidth = 977 Hz/pixel. The imaging
    parameters of the MEFSE T2 mapping sequence were as follows: TR = 895 ms, TE =
    11-77 ms (4 echoes with 22ms increments), echo train length (ETL) = 16, flip angle =
                                                                        10

    90°, slice thickness = 8 mm, matrix = 180×180, FOV = 360×360 mm2,                                                         number
    averages = 1, readout bandwidth = 651 Hz/pixel. Both MOLLI and MEFSE images were
    analyzed using the cvi42 software to generate T1 and T2 maps, respectively.
    Statistical t-test analysis was conducted to evaluate the significance of the
    measurements’ differences between different acquisition techniques (P < .001
    considered significant). Further, Bland-Altman (26) analysis was conducted to assess
    inter-method variability between different flow imaging sequences.
    Results
    Scanning times of the proposed rapid exam and conventional exam were less than 20
    minutes and greater than 1 hour, respectively. The results from conventional 2D cine
    and different 3D cine acquisitions (Figures 1-3) showed good agreement between the
    images obtained in the same subject using different acquisition strategies. Table 1
    summarizes scan time, SNR, and CNR results of different cine acquisitions. The 2-SAX,
    1-SAX, 2-AXIAL, and 1-AXIAL 3D cine acquisitions resulted in 82%, 93%, 82%, and
    92% savings in scan time, respectively, compared to conventional 2D cine acquisition.
    SNR increased by 86% in the 2-SAX 3D cine acquisition compared to conventional 2D
    cine acquisition, while it decreased by 37.5%, 49.5%, and 29% in the 1-SAX, 2-AXIAL,
    and 1-AXIAL 3D cine acquisitions, respectively. CNR increased by 24% in the 2-SAX
    3D cine acquisition compared to conventional 2D cine acquisition, while it decreased by
    26.5%, 78%, and 77.9% in the 1-SAX, 2-AXIAL, and 1-AXIAL 3D cine acquisitions,
    respectively.

    Conventional 2D cine and AXIAL and SAX 3D cine acquisitions had similar global
    cardiac function results. Conventional 2D cine acquisition resulted in LV EF of 60% and
    61%, and mass of 129g and 125g for the first and second subjects, respectively.
    Average differences in LV EF, compared to conventional 2D cine acquisition, were -8%,
    -4%, -7%, and -7% for the 2-SAX, 1-SAX, 2-AXIAL, and 1-AXIAL 3D cine acquisitions,
    respectively, while average difference in mass, compared to 2D cine acquisition, were
    5g, 2g, 3g, and 1g for the 2-SAX, 1-SAX, 2-AXIAL, and 1-AXIAL 3D cine acquisitions,
    respectively. Average end-diastolic (end-systolic) percentage differences in segmental
    wall thickness, compared to 2D cine acquisition, were 1.6%, -0.7%, -5.3%, and 6.4% (-
    7.9%, 4.1%, -1.1%, and -8.9%) for the 2-SAX, 1-SAX, 2-AXIAL, and 1-AXIAL 3D cine
    acquisitions, respectively. All measurement differences were statistically insignificant.
    Figures 4 and 5 show 2D PC flow results and the corresponding 4D flow maps and flow
    curves at different measurement sites of large arteries (aorta and pulmonary artery) and
    atrioventricular valves (mitral and tricuspid), respectively. The measurements among all
    imaged locations and studied subjects are summarized in Table 2. All scans were
    successfully           completed             without       motion         or   other       imaging      artifacts.        Various
    measurements were within normal ranges reported in the literature. Among all imaged
    locations and studied subjects, the measurements mean ± SD were as follows from 2D
    PC flow (4D-Flow) imaging: max flow = 301.5±97.2 (299.6±88.7) ml/s, forward volume =
    68.1±20.8 (62.5±15) ml3, max velocity = 55.2±26.6 (48.9±22.5) cm/s, forward flow time
    = 368±29.5 (341.5±25.2) ms, maximum pressure gradient = 2.9±1.9 (3.1±1.9) mmHG,
                                                                        12

    mean pressure gradient = 0.6±0.3 (0.6±0.3) mmHG, and E/A ratio = 2.2±0.3 (2.1±0.5).
    The differences between paired measurements from both techniques were statistically
    insignificant. Bland-Altman plots showed that all measurement differences lying within
    the 2-standard deviation difference limit (except for a single point in the maximum
    pressure gradient plot), as shown in Figure 6.
    Figure 7 shows representative SENC images and generated strain curves. The results
    showed normal strain values in the imaged subjects: Ecc = -23.5±2.1% and Ell = -
    19.7±1.9%. Corresponding tagged images are shown in the figure for reference. Figure
    8 shows resulting T1 and T2 maps, where the T1 and T2 values were within normal
    range in the imaged subjects: average T1 = 1233±221 ms and T2 = 48.5±1.7 ms.
    Discussion
    The proposed rapid CMR exam lasts for less than 20 minutes, does not require
    contrast, and results in comprehensive and accurate measurements of global and
    regional cardiac functions, hemodynamic parameters in the heart and large arteries,
    and T1 and T2 maps. The proposed exam makes the scan tolerable by sick patients
    and cost-effective and valuable from a clinical perspective.
    The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed rapid,
    comprehensive CMR exam based on advanced imaging techniques. Despite the limited
    number of imaged subjects, preliminary results from this study show the capability of
    advanced 3D-cine imaging with the proposed acquisition strategies of significantly
                                                                        13

    reducing cine scan time by 80-90%. Despite encountered reduction in spatial/temporal
    resolutions, SNR, and CNR, sufficient image quality was maintained such that the
    resulting clinical measurements were not significantly different from those obtained
    using conventional 2D cine acquisition. The single breath-hold 3D-cine acquisition,
    which is more feasible for smaller patients, further reduces total scan time and avoids
    slice mis-registration errors. Nevertheless, in patients with limited breath-holding
    capability, the single breath-hold can be split in 2 shorter breath-holds for 2 slabs
    acquisition. AXIAL 3D acquisitions save more scan time, as no additional LAX slices
    need to be acquired (they are rather reformatted from the acquired semi-isotropic 3D
    dataset) and no experience is needed for slice prescription (the operator only needs to
    place an axial box covering the heart). Nevertheless, it should be noted that AXIAL 3D
    acquisition has reduced blood-to-myocardium CNR compared to SAX 3D acquisition
    due to the time-of-flight effect in the latter when fresh unsaturated blood spins flow
    perpendicular to and into the SAX slab, resulting in brighter blood signal and therefore
    higher blood-to-myocardium CNR. Furthermore, switching from two (overlapping)
    thinner slabs acquisition to one thicker slab acquisition causes more reduction in CNR
    due to the reduced time-of-flight effect as blood travels a larger distance through the
    thicker slab, and thus becomes more saturated and has lower signal. It should be noted
    that compressed-sensing-based single-heartbeat cine imaging has been recently
    introduced by some MRI vendors (27), which could have been used in place of
    conventional 2D segmented cine acquisition with significant saving in cine scan time as
    well.

    The implemented accelerated 4D-flow technique allows for acquiring detailed whole-
    chest hemodynamic information in ~10 minutes. Measurements from accelerated 4D-
    flow were in good agreement with conventional 2D PC flow imaging. As motion
    correction is not based on navigator-echo tracking (12), the imaging time is known in
    advance and is not dependent on the patient’s breathing pattern, which allows for
    efficient use of the scan time and the capability of adjusting the imaging parameters to
    reduce the 4D-flow scan time to a specified time duration. 4D-flow imaging has several
    advantages compared to 2D PC flow imaging. Besides reduction in total scan time and
    alleviating the need for repeated breath-holds and possible scan repetitions,
    prescription of the 4D-flow scan is quite simple (only placing a box around the heart),
    and therefore, compared to 2D PC flow imaging, no cardiac-specialist scanner operator
    is needed to run the 4D-flow sequence. Further, post-processing and image analysis
    can be done at any plane of interest and is not restricted to the slices acquired during
    the CMR exam as in 2D PC flow imaging. Besides its short acquisition time, the short
    reconstruction time (~12,500 images are reconstructed inline within a couple of minutes)
    makes the scan feasible for clinical adoption as other sequences can be run on the
    scanner after the 4D-flow data acquisition without congesting the reconstruction
    pipeline. Finally, with recently available computers with large computational powers and
    cloud computing options, analysis of 4D-flow dataset can be done in realtime without
    experiencing time lags, as done in this study.
    One key advantage of the proposed rapid exam is using SENC for fast strain
    measurements in only 6 seconds. A large body of literature showed the value of
                                                                        15

    myocardial strain analysis for early detection of subclinical cardiac dysfunction in
    different cardiovascular diseases before global heart function is affected or symptoms of
    cardiovascular diseases are observed (28-30), especially in coronary artery disease
    (31) and heart failure (32), which would allow for early intervention and better outcomes.
    Further, besides providing strain measurements, SENC showed the capability of
    producing reproducible global function measurements that are in close agreement with
    those obtained from cine images (33-35). Therefore, for further reduction of scan time,
    more SENC images (a total of 6 SAX and 6 LAX slices) could be acquired to provide
    volumes and mass measurements in lieu of using cine imaging.
    It should be noted that other fast and valuable CMR sequences have been recently
    developed, which could be added to the proposed rapid CMR exam to provide more
    information with only slight increases in scan time. One example of these sequences is
    myocardial blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)-based imaging (36, 37), which
    can provide useful information about perfusion and myocardial vasodilation after
    hyperventilation maneuvers and without the need for exogeneous contrast agent or
    pharmaceutical stress agents (36). Therefore, adding the BOLD sequence to the
    proposed exam would add one more dimension, in addition to T1 and T2 mappings, for
    tissue characterization.
    One limitation of the proposed rapid exam is that it does not include perfusion or late
    gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequences for ischemia and viability imaging,
    respectively. Nevertheless, both perfusion and LGE imaging require contrast
                                                                        16

    administration and increase the scan time, especially with the delay time post contrast
    injection and before LGE imaging. Furthermore, with recent concerns about gadolinium
    side effects and accumulation in different body organs, more efforts are being made
    towards more adoption of contrast-free CMR sequences in clinical practice (38). It
    should be noted that some non-contrast-enhanced sequences showed the capability of
    identifying different tissue types, which could help for tissue characterization. For
    example, strain imaging showed the capability of differentiating between viable and
    infarcted myocardium (39-41) as well as identifying ischemic defects (42, 43) with
    results in agreement with LGE and perfusion images, respectively. Furthermore, fibrosis
    and myocardial infarction have higher T1 values compared to normal myocardium (22,
    24); therefore, the combination of functional and T1 and T2 mappings (23) could allow
    for tissue characterization without the need for gadolinium. Although in this work we
    showed the feasibility of the proposed rapid CMR exam and its advantages compared
    to conventional CMR sequences, larger studies on different patient populations would
    be valuable to further illustrate the clinical usefulness of the proposed exam.
    Conclusions
    In conclusion, the proposed CMR exam is rapid, contrast-free, and provides
    comprehensive                information           about      the     cardiovascular           system,      including         early
    development of subclinical cardiac dysfunction. Furthermore, as advanced free-
    breathing, real-time, and 3D sequences are used in the proposed rapid exam, no
    repeated breath-holds nor specific planes prescription is needed, which increases
    patient comfort and allows non-cardiac-experienced scanner operators to run the exam.

    These features are essential for improving cost-effectiveness of CMR and increasing its
    adoption in clinical practice, especially in asymptomatic patients with cardiovascular risk
    factors or patients at-risk of developing heart failure who cannot withstand a long CMR
    exam.
