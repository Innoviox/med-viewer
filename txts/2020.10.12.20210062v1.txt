  Abstract
  The state of intermediate hyperglycemia is indicative of elevated risk of developing
  type 2 diabetes1. However, the current definition of prediabetes neither reflects
  subphenotypes of pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes nor is it predictive of future
  metabolic trajectories. We used partitioning on variables derived from oral glucose
  tolerance tests, MRI measured body fat distribution, liver fat content, and genetic risk
  in a cohort of extensively phenotyped individuals who are at increased risk for type 2
  diabetes2,3 to identify six distinct clusters of subphenotypes. Three of the identified
  subphenotypes have increased glycemia (clusters 3, 5 and 6), but only individuals in
  clusters 5 and 3 have immanent diabetes risks. By contrast, those in cluster 6 have
  moderate risk of type 2 diabetes, but an increased risk of kidney disease and all-cause
  mortality. Findings were replicated in an independent cohort using simple
  anthropomorphic and glycemic constructs4. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates
  that pathophysiological heterogeneity exists before diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and
  highlights a group of individuals who have an increased risk of complications without
  rapid progression to overt type 2 diabetes.

  Introduction
  Type 2 diabetes occurs when insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells cannot
  sufficiently be increased to compensate for insulin resistance. Causes of beta-cell
  dysfunction and insulin resistance are heterogeneous, as are individual trajectories of
  hyperglycemia and subsequent manifestation of diabetes complications5. The currently
  used binary definition of type 2 diabetes is based solely on blood glucose and cannot
  differentiate between patients with mild or more aggressive disease, the latter of which
  is prone to early development of complications. In addition to blood glucose, new
  proposed diabetes classifications6,7 introduced additional variables, such as insulin
  secretion and insulin sensitivity, to sub-classify the type 2 diabetes spectrum with the
  primary aim of a better prediction of metabolic dysfunction and complications.
  The development of type 2 diabetes is a slow process, and its manifestation is
  preceded by a phase of prediabetes which often remains undiagnosed. Some diabetes
  complications, such as the unexpectedly frequent early diabetic kidney disease in the
  newly identified severe insulin resistant diabetes cluster6, might require preventive
  actions prior to the clinical manifestation of type 2 diabetes. The assessment of insulin
  secretion and insulin sensitivity could be hindered by secondary gluco-lipotoxicity,
  once diabetes has developed and glucose levels are continuously elevated8.
  Determination of prediabetes subphenotypes prior to the manifestation of diabetes
  could improve detection of individuals at risk for diabetes and complications.
  Using accurate measurements of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion based on oral
  glucose tolerance test (OGTT)-derived variables, as well as variables linked to
  diabetes pathogenesis, we describe a novel subphenotyping approach of metabolic risk
  before diabetes manifestation. Variables include HDL-cholesterol, which has been
  causally linked to type 2 diabetes9, MR-imaging-derived measures of metabolically
  unfavorable and favorable fat compartments10 and liver fat content measured with 1H-
  MR-spectroscopy. To assess genetic liability, we also incorporated a type 2 diabetes
  polygenic risk score11 as partitioning variable. The clusters identified by the
  sophisticated phenotypes in the TUEF/TULIP cohort were replicated using simpler
  markers of similar anthropometric and glycemic constructs in a large prospective
  occupational cohort (the Whitehall II study)4. Our results suggest that stratification of
                                                                       3

  Results
  Initial clustering and identification of the subphenotypes was done using data from a
  subset of participants (n=899) from the Tuebingen Family study and Tuebingen
  Lifestyle Program (TUEF/TULIP) study. Analysis was performed on data for
  participants who had no missing values for the preselected phenotyping variables:
  glucose challenge; insulin sensitivity; insulin secretion; HDL-cholesterol; liver fat
  content; subcutaneous fat volume; visceral fat volume; and a polygenic risk score for
  type 2 diabetes risk The clustering was replicated in the Whitehall II cohort (n=6810)
  using conceptually similar variables: glycemia during glucose challenge, insulin
  sensitivity, insulin secretion, fasting insulin, fasting triglycerides, waist circumference,
  hip circumference, BMI and HDL-cholesterol (Extended Data 1; see Methods).
  We identified six clusters with distinctive patterns of the variables in the TUEF/TULIP
  study (Figure 1.A,B), which were replicated in the Whitehall II cohort (Figure 1 C,D).
  Cluster characteristics and comparisons are shown in Table 1, Suppl.Table 1-3 and key
  features of the clusters are reported in Extended Data 2.
  There was a cluster-specific enrichment of the diabetes-related genetic
  variant rs10830963 in MTNR1B (ANOVA p=0.02 after Benjamini-Hochberg
  correction for multiple testing, Suppl.Table 4). Participants in cluster 3 had higher
  frequency of the diabetes-associated G allele compared with those in cluster 1
  (uncorrected p=0.00036 for cluster 3 relative to cluster 1). Using the
  pathophysiological classification of diabetes-related genetic variants proposed by
  Udler et al12, we found differences within the beta-cell group (uncorrected p=0.001,
  p=0.007 after Benjamini-Hochberg correction, Figure 2.A). Pairwise comparisons
  showed significant differences between cluster 6 and each of clusters 1, 2 and 3
  (ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test p<0.05), suggesting a lower abundance of beta-
  cell function related risk alleles in cluster 6.
  In the longitudinal analysis, all participants with available data were followed for the
  development of diabetes, nephropathy, cardiovascular endpoints and all-cause
  mortality (Figure 3). The proportional hazards assessment in Whitehall II is shown in
                                                                       5

  Suppl.Table 5. Diabetes incidence was the highest in cluster 5, followed by cluster 3 in
  both the TUEF/TULIP and Whitehall-II cohorts. Mean follow-up was 4.1 and 16.3
  years, respectively. In TUEF/TULIP, participants in cluster 6 did not demonstrate an
  increased risk for diabetes (Figure 3.A). The diabetes-risk of cluster 6 was only
  moderately elevated in Whitehall II (HR 2.22[CI:1.7-2.89] compared with cluster 1.
  Cluster 3 and 5 showed hazard ratios of 3.45[CI:2.76-4.31] and 6.62[CI:5.06-8.67],
  respectively, compared with cluster 1, (Figure 3.C, Suppl.Table 5). By contrast, cluster
  2 had a significantly lower risk of developing diabetes in the Whitehall II cohort
  compared with cluster 1 (HR 0.4[CI:0.33-0.47]). Current smoking was a risk factor for
  diabetes in Whitehall II, but did not affect the risk of diabetes for participants in
  clusters 3, 5 and 6 (Suppl.Table 6).
  In Whitehall II, there were 201 participants with incident diabetes and a defined
  Ahqlvist diabetes classification6. Relatively few participants developed diabetes in the
  metabolically healthy clusters (cluster 1: 48 of 817 [5.9%], cluster 2: 62 of 2552
  [2.4%], cluster 4: 14 of 314 [4.5%], out of those eligible for computation of the
  Ahlqvist-classes). Of these participants, most (34 of 48 [70.8%], 59 of 62 [95.2%] and
  12 of 14 [85.7%], respectively) transitioned into mild diabetes classes according to the
  Ahlqvist-classification (mild obesity-related diabetes [MOD] and mild age-related
  diabetes [MARD]). 13 of 23 participants (57%) in cluster 6 (13 of 23 [57%])
  developed severe insulin resistant diabetes (SIRD, Suppl.Table 7 and Extended Data
  3).
  We used two approaches to compare our multivariable clustering with glucose-based
  stratification alone. We first tested cumulative diabetes risk for the Hulman classes13
  that are computed from the glucose course during an OGTT (Extended Data 4). Next,
  we stratified the baseline AUC glucose of Whitehall II into 5 quintiles, (Extended Data
  5). In head-to-head comparisons, the cumulative diabetes risk of the high risk clusters
  3 and 5 together was higher than that of Hulman-classes 3 and 4 together (p=0.04,
  TUEF/TULIP) and also higher than that of the top 2 AUC glucose quintiles (p<0.0001,
  Whitehall II, both log-rank tests). Thus, our cluster-based approach was superior to
  both of these approaches in delineating groups with high cumulative risk for
  development of diabetes.

  The overall difference in the Kaplan-Meier curves for microalbuminuria did not reach
  statistical significance in TUEF/TULIP (mean follow-up 4.3 years, number of
  events=71, plog-rank, uncorrected=0.061, Figure 3.B). In the proportional hazard assessment,
  cluster 6 showed a significantly higher risk for microalbuminuria compared with
  cluster 1 (p=0.01). Results were similar but not significant for the Whitehall II
  participants with available baseline urine measurements (n=316, number of events=58,
  uncorrected p=0.058) when adjusting for baseline urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio.
  In Whitehall II, participants in cluster 6 had a significantly higher risk for stage 3
  chronic kidney disease or worse than cluster 1 (uncorrected p=0.0003, mean follow-up
  18.2 years, number of events 1387, Figure 3.D, Extended Data 6). Individuals in the
  diabetes susceptible clusters 3 and 5 also demonstrated higher risks for chronic kidney
  disease relative to cluster 1 in Whitehall II (uncorrected p=0.004 and p=0.02,
  respectively, Suppl.Table 5). The fully adjusted model also controlled for smoking,
  cholesterol and triglycerides is shown in Suppl.Table 8. Given that participants in
  cluster 6 had elevated visceral fat, we hypothesized that this could be associated with
  fat in the renal sinuses, which is a risk factor for exercise-induced microalbuminuria14.
  TUEF/TULIP participants in cluster 6 had the most renal sinus fat compared with
  other clusters (p<0.05 for all pairwise comparisons, Tukey’s post-hoc test, Figure 2.B,
  N=199). It was higher than in cluster 5 after adjusting for potential confounders
  (Suppl.Table 9.A-D).
  In the TUEF/TULIP cohort, we used carotid intima media thickness (IMT) as a proxy
  for cardiovascular end-points due to a lack of a register-based assessment of clinical
  events. IMT was associated with cluster membership (F=14.55, degrees of freedom=5,
  p<0.001). Each of clusters 3, 5 and 6 had higher IMT values than each of clusters 1, 2
  or 4 (Extended Data 7 and Suppl.Table 1, p<0.002). After adjustment for sex, age, age²
  and BMI, cluster 3 and 5 had higher IMT than cluster 1 (p<0.03). In the Whitehall II
  cohort, we evaluated the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD, mean follow-up
  17.2 years, 800 events, see Figure 2.E). As a combined vascular endpoint, we also
  investigated the incidence of CHD and stroke (mean follow-up 22.9 years, 1040
  events, Suppl.Table 5). In the proportional hazard assessment, the elevated
  cardiovascular risk in cluster 5 was not independent from sex, age and BMI, but
                                                                       7

  (Suppl.Table 5). Compared with cluster 1 in Whitehall II, all-cause mortality was by
  about 40% higher for cluster 6 (Figure 3.F), while cluster 2 had a lower mortality rate,
  even after adjustments for covariates (Suppl.Table 5). The elevated mortality risk in
  cluster 6 (relative to cluster 1) was not affected by adjustment for smoking and lipids
  (full model in Suppl.Table 10).

  Discussion
  The applied variable-based partitioning of individuals without type 2 diabetes yielded
  groups differing in risk for type 2 diabetes and its complications. We validated these
  findings using simple measures of the same pathophysiological constructs in a large
  occupational cohort.
  Cluster 5 was identified as the subpopulation of the highest risk of type 2 diabetes,
  renal and vascular disease and all-cause mortality. Individuals in this cluster had
  obesity, insulin resistance, high levels of fatty liver and low insulin secretion. Cluster 6
  represented an insulin resistant phenotype, in which participants had high amounts of
  visceral fat, but less liver fat and higher insulin secretion compared with cluster 5.
  About half of the participants in cluster 6 had prediabetes on enrollment in the
  TUEF/TULIP study. However, mean glycemia (AUC glucose) was lower than in
  cluster 5, and the risk of type 2 diabetes was considered to be moderate. Nonetheless,
  participants in cluster 6 had high risk for microalbuminuria and chronic kidney
  disease. Cardiovascular risk was not elevated in this cluster; however, overall
  mortality was about 40% higher than in the reference cluster 1 even after adjustment
  for confounders. Thus, clusters 5 and 6 both constitute obese, high-risk subpopulations
  with different glycemic, renal, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk profiles.
  Glucose does not seem to be the major driver of clinical events in cluster 6. Previous
  observations of an association of insulin resistance with diabetic nephropathy15–17
  highlight insulin resistance as a probable underlying factor. The discrepancy between
  moderate type 2 diabetes and high nephropathy risk for cluster 6 is not dependent from
  baseline blood pressure. However, individuals in cluster 6 had elevated renal sinus fat,
  which could contribute to manifestation of nephropathy. We previously showed an
  association between renal sinus fat and exercise-induced albuminuria in a cross-
  sectional cohort and an association of microalbuminuria with renal sinus fat in
  individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease14,18. In renal sinus fat and renal cell
  co-culture experiments, the combination of renal sinus fat and Fetuin-A induced
  inflammation indicate a combination of an insulin resistant metabolic milieu and
  adverse fat accumulation as a likely cause of organ damage18. This finding is
  consistent with the phenotypes of insulin resistance, moderately high liver fat and high
                                                                       9

  renal sinus fat in cluster 6. Cluster 6, in which participants had moderate or delayed
  risk of diabetes, showed a relatively low genetic risk for type 2 diabetes and a low
  abundance of genetic variants from the beta-cell class in the Udler classification12.
  This result implies an effective compensation of insulin resistance through excellent
  beta-cell function. We speculate that hyperinsulinemia associated with the
  combination of good beta-cell function and insulin resistance contributes to renal
  disease and mortality19–21. Smoking was a risk factor both for diabetes and chronic
  kidney disease22–24, but did not explain the differences among clusters.
  Contrast to the three high-risk clusters 3, 5 and 6, cluster 4 comprises participants with
  obesity but low glycemic deterioration. Phenotypic traits of individuals in this cluster
  are compatible with the concept of metabolically healthy obesity25. Cluster 4 was also
  associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes, independently from sex, age, and BMI.
  Individuals in this cluster had body fat predominantly stored in subcutaneous rather
  than visceral depots, a pattern known to be metabolically more favorable26.
  In cluster 3, the partitioning identified a phenotype characterized by elevated genetic
  risk and low insulin secretion, which might explain the high diabetes incidence seen in
  this group. The moderately elevated visceral fat compartment correlates with
  pancreatic fat, which has been associated with disturbed insulin secretion in a
  prediabetic environment18,27,28. Cluster 3 with a disposition index as low as cluster 5,
  but higher insulin sensitivity could correspond to beta-cell dysfunction subphenotypes
  identified in previous studies6,7,29. Cluster 3 had high IMT, independent from sex, age
  and BMI. Increased cardiovascular risk was not replicated for this cluster in Whitehall
  II, but individuals in this cluster had a moderately elevated risk of chronic kidney
  disease.
  Our clustering approach is not designed to provide definitive subphenotypes for
  individual patients in a clinical setting; however, the approach can be helpful for
  characterizing the metabolic heterogeneity prior to clinical manifestation of type 2
  diabetes. The identification of such subphenotypes suggests some potential therapeutic
  implications. Individuals in cluster 5 are at imminent risk for diabetes and could
  benefit from high intensity dietary and/or lifestyle interventions aimed at weight loss
  and liver fat reduction. Individuals with the characteristics of cluster 3 might benefit
                                                                       10

  from a standard aerobic exercise and dietary caloric restriction via reduction of
  visceral fat. Although clusters 3 and 5 have elevated genetic risk as non-modifiable
  risk factor, genetic predisposition might be protective against development of type 2
  diabetes for individuals with a cluster 6 phenotype. This group could be easily
  overlooked when risk-stratification focuses on established diabetes-related glycemic
  cut-offs. Insulin resistance with or without prevalent prediabetes associates with renal
  disease and elevated mortality in cluster 6, which should motivate consideration of
  preventive measures even with low glycemic progression.
  Our subphenotyping was performed in persons who did not yet suffer from diabetes,
  but who are at potentially increased risk, as demonstrated by the newly diagnosed
  cases in the follow-up period. The classification emerges partly from variables that
  require an OGTT. OGTT-derived glycemic traits can reasonably assess insulin
  sensitivity and secretion, particularly in the absence of diabetes. An elegant metabolic
  clustering of glycemic courses during OGTT has been proposed by Hulman et al13. We
  have applied an alternative approach with a broad set of variables in addition to
  OGTT. Our data complement other clustering approaches targeting the
  disentanglement of the heterogeneity of adult-onset diabetes6,7,12. We show that cluster
  6 most strongly connects to the SIRD cluster of the Ahlqvist-classification6,30. Cluster
  6 and SIRD bear similarities, such as an elevated risk of nephropathy in the absence of
  marked glucose elevation. Thus, accumulating data indicate that the pathogenesis of
  kidney damage in type 2 diabetes appears to be different from that of type 1 diabetes,
  with only a minor contribution of glycaemia in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Of
  note, by contrast with the Ahlqvist-classification, our work analyzed screen-detected
  diabetes cases as outcomes during the follow-up periods. These cases probably have
  milder phenotypes than clinically detected type 2 diabetes cases.
  Our results are demonstrated in two independent study groups: a cohort by design
  enriched in diabetes-prone persons and a UK occupational cohort. This most likely
  contributes to the observed differences between the Kaplan-Meier plots in the two
  cohorts, especially for diabetes incidence. Given the lack of ethnic diversity of the
  investigated populations leveraged in our study, our findings might only be applicable
  to white European populations. We also acknowledge the limitations of the
  partitioning approach: there is uncertainty with regard to variable selection, the
                                                                       11

  optimal number of clusters and whether these approaches are inferior to conventional
  predictions from multivariable modeling29. Additional specific limitations of our work
  are the different feature variable set and the moderate reassignment rate (63%) of the
  original clusters to the feature set of Whitehall II. Given the sophisticated nature of the
  variables in TUEF/TULIP cohort, the clinical utility of these features for metabolic
  classification could be limited. Further, in the TUEF/TULIP cohort, only about half of
  the population was available for follow-up visits. This high attrition rate could lead to
  a potential underestimation of the risk for diabetes and nephropathy in the
  TUEF/TULIP cohort. A final limitation is that the nephropathy models in Whitehall II
  are not adjusted for baseline eGFR due to a lack of baseline measurements and the
  absolute risks being low.
  In summary, we show the feasibility of multi-variable subphenotyping in individuals
  without diabetes to disentangle metabolic heterogeneity prior to diagnosis of type 2
  diabetes. The metabolic clusters identified here associate with future complications
  related to prediabetes, insulin resistance, future risk of type 2 diabetes and mortality.
  These subphenotypes likely reflect key pathologic features potentially underlying
  different fates of metabolic complications but are not aimed at classifying single
  patients in clinical practice; however, with further development and validation, such
  approaches could guide prevention and treatment strategies for cardiovascular and
  renal disease as well as type 2 diabetes.

  Figure 1. Distribution of the cluster feature variables
  Partitioning of participants into 6 clusters along 8 variables in the TUEF/TULIP
  (N=899, Panel a, b) and 9 variables in the Whitehall-II cohort (N=6810, Panel c, d).
  Panel a and c show the number of participants in each cluster with colors indicating
  glycemic categories (NGT = normal glucose tolerance, IFG = impaired fasting
  glycaemia, IGT = impaired glucose tolerance, IFG+IGT concomitant impaired fasting
  glycaemia and impaired glucose tolerance). Panel b and d show the medoids (the
  representative subject, TUEF/TULIP) or the medians (Whitehall-II) of each cluster
  with the corresponding standardized level (Z-scores) of the feature variables. Clusters
  in the Whitehall-II cohort were identified using Euclidean distances from the median
  values of the proxy variables in TUEF/TULIP that have also been assessed in
  Whitehall-II. For the radar-charts (b, d), the Z-scores of insulin sensitivity, insulin
  secretion and HDL were directionally flipped (-1*Z-score) to yield polygon areas
  related to adverse variable effects.

  Figure 2. Characteristics potentially contributing to cluster pathomechanism
  a, Mean pathway-specific genetic scores according to Udler et al across the 6 clusters
  of this work. Genetic scores (n=899 risk scores of individuals in TUEF/TULIP for
  each of the 5 specific pathways) were transformed to Z-scores to eliminate differences
  in absolute levels due to the differing number of genetic variants in each genetic
  pathway. Boxes (hinges) denote the 25th and 75th percentiles with an additional
  horizontal line indicating the median. Whiskers show the highest and lowest data
  points excluding outliers (defined as at least 1.5×interquartile range below the lower or
  above the upper hinge). Outliers are shown as individual data points. Differences were
  tested with one-way ANOVA.
  b, Distribution of renal sinus fat (ratio of sinus fat to kidney area, mean of left and
  right) for n=520 individuals with MRI-assessed renal sinus fat in TUEF/TULIP) across
  clusters (p=1.25×10-26 with one-way ANOVA). Pairwise tests for cluster 6 with

  Kaplan-Meier curves showing cluster-specific probability of not developing diabetes
  (a, c), nephropathy (c, d) in the TUEF/TULIP and Whitehall-II cohorts, respectively.
  Cumulative probability of coronary heart disease (CHD, e) and overall mortality (f)
  are shown for the Whitehall II cohort. For diabetes incidence: n=421, mean follow-up
  4.1 years, number of diabetes events = 40 in TUEF/TULIP and n=6643, mean follow-
  up 16.3 years, number of diabetes events = 828 in Whitehall II. For microalbuminuria
  incidence: n=388, mean follow-up 4.3 years, number of microalbuminuria events = 71
  in TUEF/TULIP. In Whitehall II n=5182 mean follow-up 18.2 years with 1387 Stage 3
  chronic kidney disease or worse (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60
  ml/min/1.73m2) incidences. For CHD, n=6537, mean follow-up 17.2 years, 800

  Methods
  TUEF/TULIP cohort
  Prediabetes subphenotyping was initially performed on a complete cases subset of
  participants of the Tuebingen Family study and Tuebingen Lifestyle Program
  (TUEF/TULIP)2,3, who had no missing values for the preselected phenotyping
  variables (N=899, baseline characteristics for this and the whole cohort are shown in
  the Suppl.Table 11). Participants were recruited from 2003 through 2018. Recruitment
  was mostly performed via newspaper announcements and e-mail bulletins. The studies
  have been designed to phenotype individuals at increased risk of diabetes. Eligibility
  criteria for inclusion comprised either a history of prediabetes, a family history of
  diabetes, a BMI greater than 27 kg/m2 or a history of gestational diabetes2. Participants
  underwent a frequently sampled OGTT and received MR-tomography-based
  measurement of body fat distribution and 1H-MR-spectroscopy-based measurements
  of hepatic fat content. Follow-up data was available for individuals who responded to
  invitations to follow-up appointments or participated in follow-up studies. The follow-
  up measurements were comparable to the initial assessments. Glycemic traits (fasting
  glucose, OGTT or HbA1c) were available for 421 participants, whereas urine sample
  during follow-up, for the determination of microalbuminuria, was available for 388
  participants. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
  University of Tübingen (422/2002). All participants gave written informed consent.
  Whitehall II cohort
  Data from the occupational Whitehall II cohort were accessed by a data sharing
  agreement. Details of the study have been described elsewhere4. In brief, the study was
  established to explore the relationship between socio-economic status, stress and
  cardiovascular disease. All London-based civil servants aged 33-55 years were invited
  in 1985-1988 and 10.308 (73%) participated. Since then, 5 further clinical
  examinations have taken place that are available for data sharing at approximately 5-
  year intervals (phases 3,5, 7, 9 and 11). The study was approved by the Joint
  UCL/UCLH Committees on the Ethics of Human Research (Committee Alpha). For
  the current analysis, the baseline was defined as the first available fasting OGTT (>=8
                                                                       26

  hours of fasting for morning and >=5 hours of fasting after a light fat-free breakfast
  eaten before 8 am for afternoon OGTTs). Participants with prevalent or incident
  diabetes at baseline and those with non-white ethnicities were excluded. From the
  6916 available baseline OGTTs, 6810 were complete cases in regards of the used
  clustering variables und underwent cluster assignments. The cohort characteristics are
  reported in Suppl.Table 12.
  Variable selection and de novo clustering in TUEF/TULIP
  We aimed to identify subphenotypes that reflect differences in pathophysiological
  processes in the natural history of type 2 diabetes. The main paradigm of type 2
  diabetes pathogenesis is an insufficient compensatory increase of insulin secretion in
  response to insulin resistance31. Therefore, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion are
  key variables6,7. We used OGTT-based indices of insulin sensitivity (Matsuda-index)32
  and insulin secretion (AUC0-30 C-peptide/AUC0-30 glucose) that correlate well with
  gold-standard measures and are preferable to static measurements obtained in the
  fasting state33,34. Glycaemia was quantified in the partitioning procedure as AUC0-120
  glucose. Furthermore, we aimed to capture diverse etiologies of insulin resistance by
  accounting for visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue volume (VAT and SCAT),
  that have distinct metabolic characteristics35. We especially focused on elevated liver
  fat content, as it is strongly associated with insulin resistance36. HDL-cholesterol
  levels have been long known as explanatory variables of the metabolic syndrome and
  insulin resistance37. Moreover, causal inference from large genomic datasets provides
  evidence not only for a genetic correlation of HDL-cholesterol levels with type 2
  diabetes, but also for a causal link between HDL-cholesterol levels and type 2
  diabetes9. We also added a genome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) to the analysis to
  better differentiate between genetically determined beta-cell dysfunction and
  environmentally determined beta-cell dysfunction. The correlation of the clustering
  variables is reported in Suppl.Table 13.
  For computation of the PRS, we used the LDpred algorithm of Vilhjalmson et al.38 on
  a combination of BMI-adjusted effect sizes and p-values from a meta-analysis in
  ~900.000 European individuals and genotypes11. After quality control, exclusion of
  multi-allelic and low-frequency variants, we combined 484.788 variants from the two
                                                                       27

  datasets, yielding an estimated genome-wide SNP-heritability of 0.069. Of the top 94
  diabetes-related genetic variants shown in the latest large-scale genome-wide
  association study11, 63 were genotyped in TUEF/TULIP. The association of cluster-
  assignment with the genotype was tested separately for each variant using ANOVA to
  analyze the enrichment of certain genotypes in clusters. A further genetic-
  pathophysiologic classification of clusters was performed according to data from
  Udler et al12. Here, we computed the genetic risk score for every individual and every
  genetic class (beta-cell, proinsulin, obesity, lipodystrophy and liver/lipid) taking only
  weights >= 0.75 into account, as described in the original publication. The
  classification of glucose response curves according to Hulman et al (Hulman-classes)
  was performed with the corresponding web-calculator from 5-point OGTT glucose
  values in the TUEF/TULIP study13.
  Cluster assignment in the Whitehall II cohort
  For assigning participants in the Whitehall II cohort to clusters established in
  TUEF/TULIP, we used proxy variables. Since liver fat, visceral adipose tissue and
  subcutaneous adipose tissue were not available in the Whitehall II cohort, and only
  two-point OGTTs were performed, other anthropometric variables and analytes were
  employed instead of these variables. Variables were selected based on statistical
  consideration (correlation) and pathophysiologic (theoretical) connection to the
  original trait (e.g. liver fat – fasting triglycerides, fasting insulin and waist
  circumference). Transaminase activity was not available during the early phases of the
  Whitehall II study. The final variable set was selected upon the highest agreement in
  re-identification of the original cluster assignments using the new proxy variables in
  TUEF. The variables used in Whitehall II comprised glycemia during glucose
  challenge, insulin sensitivity32, Stumvoll’s first phase insulin secretion index using
  insulin and glucose levels at fasting and at 120 min during OGTT39, fasting insulin,
  fasting triglycerides, waist circumference, hip circumference, BMI and HDL-
  cholesterol. The median values of these variables in TUEF/TULIP were used to assign
  participants to clusters in Whitehall II (Extended data 1) by taking the nearest
  neighbors of the 6 cluster-centers based upon Euclidean distances. Since Whitehall-II
  used a restricted CVD-focused genotyping platform with only 48000 markers and the
  release of full-scale genotyping data was not readily available, we decided to omit the
                                                                       28

  genetic risk score from the re-assignment procedure. Despite these limitations,
  successful re-assignment of the clusters was achieved in 63% of the original TUEF
  cohort.
  OGTT and laboratory analysis
  All participants of TUEF/TULIP received a 75-g glucose solution (Accu-Check
  Dextro, Roche) at 8 a.m. following an overnight fast. Venous blood was obtained
  through an indwelling venous catheter before and 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after
  glucose ingestion. In the Whitehall II cohort, the OGTT procedure has been described
  earlier. In short, venous blood samples were collected after an overnight fast in the
  morning (≥8 hours of fasting) or in the afternoon after no more than a light fat-free
  breakfast eaten before 08.00 h (≥5 hours of fasting) followed by a standard 75g OGTT
  with a venous blood sample taken 2 hours after ingestion of the glucose solution.
  Glucose was analyzed in the Whitehall II study using an YSI glucose analyser (Yellow
  Springs Instruments). Glucose values were measured in TUEF/TULIP directly using a
  bedside glucose analyzer (YSI, Yellow Springs, CO or Biosen C-line, EKF-diagnostic,
  Barleben). In TUEF/TULIP, all other obtained blood samples were put on ice, the
  serum was centrifuged within 2 hours. Plasma insulin and C-peptide were determined
  by an immunoassay with the ADVIA Centaur XP Immunoassay System and HDL was
  measured using the ADVIA XPT clinical chemical analyser (all from Siemens
  Healthineers, Eschborn, Germany), while triglycerides were measured with standard
  colorimetric methods using a Bayer analyzer. In Whitehall II, insulin was measured
  with an in-house human insulin RIA and later with a DAKO ELISA kit (DAKO
  Cytomatin Ltd, Ely, UK). Serum creatinine was measured using a kinetic colorimetric
  (Jaffe) method on a Roche “P” Modular system (phase 9) and on a COBAS 8000
  system (phase 11). Lipid measurements were described previously40 . HbA1c
  measurements were performed using Tosoh glycohemoglobin analyzers in both studies
  (Tosoh Bioscience Tokyo Japan).
  Body fat distribution, liver fat content and renal sinus fat
  Body fat distribution variables, i.e., VAT and SCAT, were determined by whole-body
  T1-weighted MRI as described earlier41. Liver fat content was measured by volume
  selective 1H-MR spectroscopy42. Renal sinus fat was measured with manual
  segmentation from MR image slices specifically in cluster 5 and 6 using a method
                                                                       29

  described previously14. The operator performing the segmentation (JM) was not aware
  of the cluster assignments. The procedure could not be completed in 6 participants
  (2% missing) due to breathing artefacts in the images. Renal sinus fat data for clusters
  1 to 4 were partly available from segmentations for previous projects (mean data
  availability 40% over cluster 1 to 4).
  Outcomes
  For detection of incident diabetes, either of the following was used: clinically
  ascertained diabetes (from patient history, or by the use of a diabetes-medication), an
  elevated fasting glucose (>=7 mmol/l), post-challenge glucose (>=11.1. mmol/l, or
  HbA1c (48 mmol/mol or 6.5%) in both cohorts. To assess the Ahlqvist-classification6
  for the subtypes of diabetes in Whitehall II, we used insulin-based HOMA2-indices,
  because C-peptide was not measured. GAD measurements were not available. HbA1c
  assessment had been introduced beginning with Phase 7. Cluster assignment was
  performed using the lowest Euclidean distances from the published cluster centers in
  the All New Diabetes in Scania (ANDIS) cohort after scaling the variables for the
  means and SDs of the ANDIS cohort. Microalbuminuria was assessed in
  TUEF/TULIP upon the first occurrence from morning spot urine using the albumin-to-
  creatinine ratio (ACR). Measurements with excessive leukocyturia (175 measurements
  out of 3218) were excluded from this analysis. Microalbuminuria was established with
  an ACR>=30 mg/g creatinine. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), which is
  associated with future cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events43, was determined by
  a high-resolution ultrasound of the left and right common carotid artery. A trained
  physician who was unaware of the clinical and laboratory variables of the participants
  performed B-mode ultrasound imaging using a linear ultrasound transducer (10-13
  MHz; AU5 Harmonic, ESAOTE BIOMEDICA, Hallbergmoos, Germany). IMT was
  specified according to the European Mannheim carotid intima-media thickness
  consensus criteria44. To ascertain renal disease, we used estimated glomerular filtration
  rate calculated using the CKD-EPI creatinine equation45. Serum creatinine was
  available from phase 9. Only participants with at least one eGFR value went into these
  analyses. Stages of chronic kidney disease were ascertained with the Kidney Disease:
  Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification46. Ascertainment of coronary
  heart disease and mortality in Whitehall-II has been described earlier47. In brief,
                                                                       30

  incident CHD was defined as CHD death, nonfatal CHD and typical angina
  ascertained from clinical records, without self-reported cases from the Rose angina
  questionnaire. The cases were ascertained from participants' general practitioners,
  information extracted from hospital medical records by study nurses, or data from the
  NHS Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and death register databases obtained after
  linking the participants' unique NHS identification numbers to this national database.
  Mortality data until June 2015 was drawn from the British National Mortality Register
  (National Health Service [NHS] Central Register) using each participants’ NHS
  identification number.
  Statistical analysis
  Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.4.348. In the clustering analysis,
  distances were computed as Gower-distances using standardized variables (scaled to a
  mean of 0 and SD of 1). Participants with outlier variables (absolute standardized
  levels >= 5) were excluded from the clustering procedure. To find the optimal cluster
  count, we evaluated the dendogram and silhouette-widths. The clustering procedure
  was performed with the partitioning around medoids (pam) method in the R-package
  “cluster”, which is a more robust version of k-means clustering49. Using repeated
  subsetting with the clusterboot function from the fpc package, the mean Jaccard-
  similarity measure was 0.74 across all clusters.50 To further validate the stability of
  clusters, we iterated the clustering procedure for each of the 429 participants who had
  repeated measurements comprising all clustering variables (mean number of
  measurements 2.6±0.9, follow-up duration 4.2±3.6 years, also see Extended Data 8).
  We assessed the per-participant agreement of the generated 1112 cluster assignments
  using interrater reliabilities. The ICC2k value for cluster agreement was 0.72 (CI 0.68
  – 0.76). Detailed reports on means and SDs of the clustering variables in both cohorts
  and the cluster medians are provided in Suppl.Tables 14-15.
  Cluster means were compared using ANOVA. Specific outcomes were compared
  using ANCOVA adjusting for covariates such as sex, age and BMI. Post-hoc
  comparisons were performed using Tukey’s honest significant differences procedure.
  Endpoints related to diabetes complications were analyzed in the follow-up data of
  both cohorts using survival analysis and proportional hazard models. Differences in
  cumulative risks for reaching endpoints were tested with log-rank tests. When not
                                                                       31

  indicated otherwise, the uncorrected p-value of a specific cluster’s risk relative to
  cluster 1 is provided in the proportional hazard analysis. Given the relatively low
  number of outcomes in TUEF/TULIP (40 for diabetes and 71 for microalbuminuria),
  assessment of proportional hazards adjusted for potential confounders was performed
  in the Whitehall II cohort only. Proportional hazards assumptions were tested by
  visualization of the Schoenfeld-residuals. The performed statistical tests were two-
  sided.
