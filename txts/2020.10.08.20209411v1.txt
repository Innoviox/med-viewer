25    Introductory paragraph
26    The mechanisms that underpin COVID-19 disease severity, and determine the outcome of infection,
27    are only beginning to be unraveled. The host inflammatory response contributes to lung injury, but
28    circulating mediators levels fall below those in classical ‘cytokine storms’. We analyzed serial plasma
29    samples from 619 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 recruited through the prospective
30    multicenter ISARIC clinical characterization protocol U.K. study and 39 milder community cases not
31    requiring hospitalization. Elevated levels of numerous mediators including angiopoietin-2, CXCL10,
32    and GM-CSF were seen at recruitment in patients who later died. Markers of endothelial injury
33    (angiopoietin-2 and von-Willebrand factor A2) were detected early in some patients, while
34    inflammatory cytokines and markers of lung injury persisted for several weeks in fatal COVID-19
35    despite decreasing antiviral cytokine levels. Overall, markers of myeloid or endothelial cell activation
36    were associated with severe, progressive, and fatal disease indicating a central role for innate
37    immune activation and vascular inflammation in COVID-19.
38    Main text
39    Fatal COVID-19 is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and raised systemic
40    inflammatory markers including IL-6 and C-reactive protein, often accompanied by neutrophilia and
41    lymphopenia 1. The beneficial effect of corticosteroid treatment in severe disease highlights the role
42    of steroid-responsive inflammation in pathogenesis 2, 3, and post-mortem studies report pulmonary
43    vessel vasculitis (most commonly myeloid cells) and microthrombosis in fatal COVID-19 4, 5, 6, 7. The
44    virus-induced inflammatory state has laboratory features that resemble secondary haemophagocytic
45    lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) 8, 9, 10 but the exact pattern and severity of inflammatory responses has
46    been only partially characterized. Levels of some inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, are
47    elevated in COVID-19, but are typically ten times lower than those reported in acute respiratory
48    distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis 11, 12, 13, suggesting that other factors may play a major role in
49    COVID-19 severity. Host genetic factors may also influence disease severity, with polymorphisms in
                                                                                                                                  3

50    several regions, including the interferon pathway genes IFNAR2 and OAS1/2/3 recently associated
51    with enhanced disease severity 14. Identification of such genetic of inflammatory factors may define
52    a ‘treatable trait’ 15, allowing both stratification of patients likely to benefit from therapies such as
53    dexamethasone and targeted biological anti-cytokine therapies, and design of novel therapeutics
54    targeting causative pathways.
55    Early clinical studies of COVID-19 identified elevated neutrophil counts and lymphopenia in
56    peripheral blood 1, 16, predominantly seen in late-stage disease and of limited prognostic value.
57    Peripheral blood neutrophilia is also seen in other severe respiratory viral 17 and bacterial 18
58    infections, suggesting that this is not a unique feature of COVID-19. Elevated levels of D-dimer, a
59    product of fibrin-degradation associated with thrombosis and inflammation, have also been
60    observed in COVID-19 16, consistent with systemic inflammation and the high frequency of
61    macrovascular thrombotic complications in severe cases 7, 19. Post-mortem studies show that
62    thromboses and microthrombi within pulmonary vessels are common in fatal COVID-19 and are
63    associated with endothelial responses distinct from those that occur during fatal influenza A virus
64    infection 4, 5, 7, 20. However, the thrombotic aspects of life-threatening COVID-19, and the interaction
65    of this process with cytokine release have hitherto been described in relatively small groups of cases,
66    from single-center studies, or with a narrow range of disease severities.
67    Within the ISARIC4C study we obtained clinical data and 1,047 plasma samples from 619 hospitalized
68    patients with COVID-19 21, 22. Given the large number of cases, patients from the ISARIC4C database
69    could be stratified into five levels of severity according to their peak illness, in line with the World
70    Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale 23 (Supplementary Table 1): (1) no oxygen requirement
71    (Severity 3, n=169); (2) patients requiring oxygen by face mask (Severity 4, n=143); (3) patients
72    requiring high-flow nasal cannulae, a continuous positive airway pressure mask or other non-
73    invasive ventilation (Severity 5 n=99); (4) patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (Severity
74    6/7, n=113); and (5) fatal COVID-19 (Severity 8, n=95). The median duration of symptoms prior to
                                                                                                                                  4

 75    study enrollment was similar in all groups: Severity 3, 7 days; Severity 4, 9 days; Severity 5, 11 days;
 76    Severity 6/7, 11 days; and Severity 8, 8 days. Some differences in routinely performed clinical
 77    hematology and biochemistry measures were evident between clinical outcome groups at the time
 78    of study enrolment: Lymphopenia was evident in groups 6/7 and 8, relative to 3, alongside
 79    neutrophilia in 6/7 and 8 relative to 3 and 4 (Supplementary Fig. 1a and 1b, respectively). No
 80    differences between groups were observed in ferritin levels, whilst LDH was elevated in groups 5,
 81    6/7, and 8 relative to 3 (Supplementary Fig. 1c and 1d, respectively). Procalcitonin levels were
 82    elevated in group 8 relative to 3 and 4, and in group 6/7 relative to 4 (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Partial
 83    HScores 24 were calculated (fever, cytopenia, ferritin, triglycerides, and AST) but the only significant
 84    difference between groups was between 6/7 and 4, indicating that sHLH is unlikely to be the
 85    predominant pathophysiological mechanism in life-threatening COVID-19 (Supplementary Fig. 1f).
 86    The ISARIC4C mortality scores 25 for these patients demonstrated an elevated risk of mortality,
 87    calculated from admission data, in those that would progress to fatal disease (group 8) relative to all
 88    other groups (Supplementary Fig. 1g), though there was considerable overlap between all groups.
 89    Together, these data indicated limited clinical or biochemical differences between patient outcome
 90    groups at the time of hospital admission.
 91    We hypothesized that differences in the levels of plasma inflammatory mediators would reflect the
 92    nature and scale of immunopathology in COVID-19 and would associate with different disease
 93    outcomes. We therefore quantified 33 mediators in all available plasma samples using panels
 94    designed to study a broad range of mediators that could be broadly categorized as having roles in
 95    antiviral immunity, inflammation, or coagulation 16, 19. Analysis of plasma mediator levels at the time
 96    of enrolment distinguished 3 clusters of patients that were associated with distinct patterns of
 97    mediator levels (Fig. 1). The first of these clusters was enriched in patients from groups 6/7 and 8
 98    and was associated with higher levels of CXCL10, GM-CSF, D-dimer, and vWF-A2. The second cluster
 99    contained a more diverse mixture of severities and had a more pronounced pattern of coagulation
100    factor XIV and angiopoietin-2 containing mediator clusters, but lower levels of the CXCL10 containing
                                                                                                                                   5

101    mediator cluster. The third patient cluster had lower levels of the CXCL10, D-dimer, and coagulation
102    factor XIV containing mediator clusters, but had a more varied pattern of other mediators including
103    IL-6Rα, VEGF-D, and IL-4. Interestingly, this analysis did not indicate any obvious patterns of age,
104    symptom duration (onset), or sex in these plasma mediator levels. This analysis shows that, at the
105    time of enrolment, different COVID-19 outcome groups were already identifiable and associated
106    with distinct patterns of inflammatory mediators and that markers such as D-dimer, EN-RAGE,
107    CXCL10, and GM-CSF were particularly associated with enhanced disease severity. However, entry to
108    the study was determined by hospitalization which will be influenced by predisposing factors; these
109    factors may therefore not be evident in the data that we accumulate.
110    To further explore the relationship between the mediator levels and severity we analyzed plasma
111    from 15 healthy controls (7 males, median age 55, range 45-71) and 39 individuals recruited 7 days
112    after a SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR test who did not require hospitalization (15 males, median age 43,
113    range 27-62, termed group ‘1/2’ as per the WHO scale 23) and related these to hospitalized patients.
114    At the time of enrollment, numerous differences were evident between hospitalized COVID-19
115    patients and the control groups, along with many differences across the clinical outcome groups in
116    hospitalized patients (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). In contrast to other reports 26 we found no
117    evident deficiency in IFN-α levels in those with severe disease (Fig. 2a). IFN-γ was elevated in
118    hospitalized COVID-19 patients relative to both healthy controls (HC) and group 1/2 (Fig. 2b) and was
119    elevated in the most severe outcome groups, relative to lower severity grades. The interferon-
120    induced chemokine CXCL10 was also substantially elevated in all hospitalized COVID-19 cases
121    relative to the control groups, with the most pronounced increases in groups 6/7 and 8 (Fig. 2c).
122    These results are in contrast to the decreased ISG gene expression in peripheral blood samples from
123    patients with severe COVID-19 26, showing that the gene expression pattern from blood does not
124    necessarily reflect the directly measured levels of gene product. We speculate that the abundance of
125    IFN-γ and CXCL10 results from release from the site of disease rather than from circulating cells,
                                                                                                                                   6

126    though anti-IFN autoantibodies 27 and polymorphisms in IFN signaling 14 may influence this pathway
127    in some patients.
128    The fibrin degradation product D-dimer has been reported to be elevated in severe COVID-19 16,
129    implicating thrombosis in disease severity 4, 5, 20. In agreement with these reports, D-dimer was
130    elevated in all hospitalized groups, but little difference was observed between the severity groups at
131    the time of enrolment (Fig. 2d). Given reports of the association between COVID-19 mortality and
132    pulmonary vasculitis 4, we hypothesized that endothelial injury may be a feature of COVID-19,
133    potentially triggering coagulation and the thrombotic complications common in severe disease 19, 28.
134    Indeed, levels of angiopoietin-2, a marker of endothelial injury, were elevated in all hospitalized
135    patients relative to both control groups (Fig. 2e), with levels 5.6-fold higher in the mildest
136    hospitalized patients (group 3, median=1983pg/ml) than HCs (median=352pg/ml). Angiopoetin-2
137    levels were also significantly elevated in groups 6/7 and 8 relative to all other hospitalized COVID-19
138    outcome groups (Fig. 2e). As both angiopoietin-2 and vWF-A2 can enter the blood plasma through
139    exocytosis of endothelial cell Weibel-Palade bodies 29, we also quantified vWF-A2, which was
140    similarly elevated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2f). In line with these markers of
141    endothelial injury and thrombosis, thrombomodulin, vWF-A2, and endothelin-1 were also elevated
142    in COVID-19, predominantly in those most severe patient outcome groups (Supplementary Fig. 2).
143    Elevations in these prothrombotic mediators were not counteracted by levels of the inhibitors
144    angiopoietin-1 or soluble Tie2, which were not significantly different between the tested groups (Fig.
145    S2). These results suggested that endothelial injury and coagulation are common features of patients
146    hospitalized with COVID-19 and that these are most pronounced in severe and fatal COVID-19.
147    In line with other reports 1, 12, we found that IL-6 was also significantly elevated in most hospitalized
148    groups relative to the controls (Fig. 2g), with a stepwise increase in levels with escalating severity. IL-
149    6 levels in groups 6/7 and 8 were significantly elevated above all other groups (all P<0.0001, Fig. 2g).
150    In agreement with the association of a strong inflammatory response with COVID-19 severity, GM-
                                                                                                                                   7

151    CSF was similarly elevated in all hospitalized groups, relative to controls and was most pronounced
152    in the groups 6/7 and 8 (Fig. 2h). Numerous other inflammatory cytokines and chemokines showed
153    similar results including TNF-α, IL-2, GDF-15, G-CSF, and VEGF-D (Supplementary Fig. 2). EN-
154    RAGE/S100A12 has previously been characterized as a marker of respiratory damage in ARDS 30 and
155    indeed was elevated in groups 6/7 and 8 relative to most others (Fig. 2i). The neutrophil chemokine
156    IL-8 (CXCL8) was similarly elevated in severe disease, as was the neutrophil gelatinase associated
157    lipocalin (LCN-2/NGAL) (Supplementary Fig. 2), in line with the reported association between blood
158    neutrophilia and severity 16 also seen in this cohort (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
159    Other immunological mediators (IL-6Rα, IL-13, IL-17) were not significantly different between
160    groups, indicating that only limited aspects of the immune repertoire were active in COVID-19.
161    Interestingly, IL-4 levels were lower in the non-severe disease outcome groups (3, 4, and 5) relative
162    to both the control groups and the severe disease groups 6/7 and 8 (Supplementary Fig. 2),
163    indicating that suppression of the normal levels of type-2 cytokines may be associated with milder
164    COVID-19 disease, and that this mechanism is lost in severe disease. Similarly, IL-12p70, commonly
165    released by antigen presenting cells (APCs) 31, was decreased in all hospitalized cases relative to the
166    HCs and group 1/2 (Figure S2), possibly owing to the trafficking of APCs to the site(s) of viral
167    infection.
168    To determine the strength of the relationships between these individual plasma mediators we
169    performed a hierarchical correlation matrix analysis of mediators from plasma samples collected at
170    the time of study enrolment. This identified a strongly correlated cluster of inflammatory mediators
171    including GM-CSF, CXCL10, vWF-A2, and IL-6 (Fig. 3a); increases in which were commonly associated
172    with the most severe COVID-19 outcome groups. Given the strong association between age and
173    COVID-19 severity 22, and reports of increased inflammatory responses in males relative to females
174    with COVID-19 32 we investigated the influence of these demographic factors on plasma mediators
175    levels in hospitalized patients. As the major effect in our cluster analysis was severity (Fig. 1), we

176    further stratified each of these severity groups by age (≥ or < 70 years of age) and sex, to better
177    account for the influence of disease severity on plasma mediator levels. Following adjustment for
178    multiple testing, no mediator was found to be statistically different between males and females
179    within each outcome group (Supplementary Fig. 3). By contrast, several differences were evident
180    between those aged ≥70 and <70 years, including elevated levels of D-dimer, CXCL10, and GM-CSF in
181    those aged ≥70 years; IFN-γ levels were, by contrast, greater in younger patients within severity
182    group 4 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 3).
183    We next sought to determine the changes in levels of some key plasma mediators from the time of
184    enrolment over the course of disease, by relating data to the patient reported duration of symptoms
185    at the time of each sample collection, including consecutive samples collected from individual
186    patients. This analysis indicated that many mediators were stable over the time-course of
187    hospitalization, supporting the validity of using samples from the time of enrolment to study the
188    immunologic basis of COVID-19. However, some mediators did change over time; for example, there
189    was a gradual decrease in IFN-γ and CXCL10 over time in most groups (Supplementary Fig. 4),
190    including group 8 (Fig. 4a and 4b, respectively). By contrast some other mediators remained
191    elevated or appeared to increase over the duration of symptoms in group 8, including angiopoietin-2
192    and D-dimer (Fig. 4c and 4d, respectively). Similarly, the inflammatory mediators GM-CSF and EN-
193    RAGE remained elevated or increased in group 8 in the latter stages of disease (Fig. 4e and 4f,
194    respectively). Together, these results indicated that the most severe outcomes of COVID-19 disease
195    were associated with persistent coagulation and inflammation, even as IFN levels declined.
196    Finally, we hypothesized that differences in plasma mediator levels between patients with Severe
197    (groups 6/7 and 8) and Non-severe (groups 3, 4, and 5) COVID-19 would be apparent within the first
198    few days of symptoms. Indeed, within the first 4 days of symptoms several mediators were
199    significantly elevated in the Severe group, relative to Non-severe, including IL-2, IL-6, and GM-CSF
200    (all P<0.0001, Fig. 4g-i, respectively), indicating a pronounced inflammatory response early in Severe
                                                                                                                                   9

201    disease. Similarly, many markers of coagulation and endothelial injury were elevated in Severe,
202    relative to Non-severe, including D-dimer and vWF-A2 (P<0.0001, Fig. 4j and 4k, respectively), in
203    addition to angiopoietin-2 and IL-1α (which can be activated by thrombin 33) (Supplementary Fig. 5).
204    By comparison the lung damage-associated marker EN-RAGE 30 was not significantly different
205    between the Severe and Non-severe groups in the first 4 days of symptoms (P=0.098,
206    Supplementary Fig. 5). Together, these data indicated that severe COVID-19 is associated with
207    elevated levels of plasma mediators indicative of coagulation, endothelial activation and a broad
208    inflammatory response including CXCL10, GM-CSF, and IL-6. These differences were apparent within
209    the first days of symptoms, while markers of lung damage may only become elevated later in
210    disease, potentially indicating a pathological role for these processes and a window of opportunity
211    for early immunomodulation to prevent significant lung damage.
212    While markers of fibrinolysis have previously been associated with disease severity 16 and
213    thrombosis is common in severe and fatal COVID-19 4, 5, 20 the causes of this manifestation of severe
214    disease are not known. We demonstrate that increasing disease severity is associated with broad
215    elevations in inflammatory mediator levels, alongside a signature of endothelial injury. This signal
216    was most pronounced in fatal COVID-19 and was apparent even in the early stages of disease.
217    The elevation of angiopoietin-2, thrombomodulin, and vWF-A2 in fatal COVID-19 cases provides
218    evidence for the involvement of endothelial injury in COVID-19 severity. Endothelial injury following
219    inflammatory damage, including the increasingly recognized pulmonary artery vasculitis 4, 20 in
220    COVID-19, may result in the initiation of a pro-coagulant role for these cells 34. Alternatively, this
221    response could be triggered by direct viral infection of vascular cells (though this has yet to be
222    conclusively determined 34 viral replication in non-respiratory tissues is commonly observed at post-
223    mortem 4, 7); or thrombin mediated activation of IL-1α 33. This pro-coagulant role could lead to the
224    deposition of microthrombi, evident in COVID-19 4, the development of features of disseminated
225    intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) and ultimately elevated levels D-dimer through the degradation of
                                                                                                                                  10

226    fibrin rich thrombi 28. Neutrophilic inflammation could have an etiological role in endothelial injury
227    though neutrophilia is predominantly a feature of the later phases of COVID-19 1, while endothelial
228    injury was evident in the first days of symptoms. However, the continued thrombosis in late stage
229    fatal COVID-19 may result from neutrophil mediated coagulation, observed in other settings 35, 36, 37
230    and recently demonstrated in COVID-19 38. Combined, these results indicate a multiplicity of possible
231    pro-coagulant triggers that may contribute to pathology at different stages of disease.
232    We found that the antiviral immune mediator CXCL10 and the myeloid cell growth factor GM-CSF,
233    were strikingly elevated in fatal cases of COVID-19. This is confirmed by a recent report describing
234    the potential utility of CXCL10 as an early prognostic marker of COVID-19 severity 39. An influx of
235    monocytes/macrophages has been described in the lung parenchyma in fatal COVID-19, combined
236    with a mononuclear cell pulmonary artery vasculitis 6, and presence of pro-inflammatory monocyte-
237    derived macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with severe COVID-19 4, 40. The
238    elevation of CXCL10 and GM-CSF in severe disease reported here could contribute to monocyte
239    recruitment and activation leading to this vasculitis, alongside the role of GM-CSF in the recruitment
240    of neutrophils to the pulmonary vasculature 41.
241    Large scale randomized clinical trials for IL-6 signaling antagonists are on-going, though early results
242    of the COVACTA trial of Tocilizumab found no improvement in clinical status or mortality 42. Small
243    scale studies of anti-GM-CSF have shown promising results 43, 44 but require formal testing in a
244    clinical trial. Given the role of GM-CSF in granulopoiesis and enhancement of neutrophil survival,
245    alongside the neutrophil activation observed in late stage fatal COVID-19, these trials may inform
246    our understanding of the importance of this pathway in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis 45. While
247    early studies demonstrated elevated GM-CSF levels in both ICU and non-ICU treated COVID-19
248    patients 1, we now demonstrate a positive association with disease severity and outcome, in
249    agreement with reports of elevated frequencies of GM-CSF+ Th1 cells in patients with COVID-19
250    requiring ICU treatment 46.

251    While many cytokines and other inflammatory mediators were most significantly elevated in fatal
252    and critical COVID-19, these data do not necessarily support the concept of a “cytokine storm” in
253    COVID-19 12, 13. While some elements, such as elevated IL-6 and ferritin levels (reported in other
254    studies, but not seen here) 8, 9, 10, are reminiscent of sHLH, the relatively gradual clinical progression
255    and persistent elevation of some cytokines, even during the early stages of symptomatic disease, are
256    uncommon amongst conditions associated with cytokine storms such as toxic-shock syndrome and
257    bacterial sepsis.
258    To our knowledge, this is to date the largest study of inflammatory responses in COVID-19. The
259    multicenter nature of ISARIC4C adds to the ability to interpret and apply these results to other
260    settings. However, further studies are needed to determine the prognostic value of these key plasma
261    biomarkers, including multivariable analyses of biological data alongside clinical and demographic
262    data. This detailed level of analysis may also enable the phenotyping of patients most likely to
263    respond to individual therapies. Future analyses should focus on the biological features of patients
264    that respond to therapeutic interventions, such as dexamethasone 2, 3, to enable mechanistic insight
265    and targeting of treatment. The clear distinction between patients that would progress to severe
266    COVID-19 and those that would not, even in the earliest stages of disease, indicates that early
267    therapeutic intervention may be crucial to limit mortality. Overall, these data indicate an early
268    inflammatory response in COVID-19, most prominent in those who will later suffer severe or fatal
269    disease. These responses may enable the development of prognostic biomarkers, inform our
270    understanding of immunopathogenesis in COVID-19 and enable novel approaches for therapeutic
271    intervention.

272    Supplementary Methods
273    Study design and setting
274    The ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterization Protocol for Severe Emerging Infections in the UK (CCP-UK)
275    is an ongoing prospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, which is recruiting in
276    258 hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales (National Institute for Health Research Clinical
277    Research Network Central Portfolio Management System ID: 14152) 47. The protocol, revision
278    history, case report form, patient information leaflets, consent forms and details of the Independent
279    Data and Material Access Committee are available online 48 and published previously 22.
280    Participants
281    Hospitalized patients with PCR-proven or high likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited,
282    including both patients with community- and hospital-acquired COVID-19. This study analyzed
283    plasma from blood samples obtained on the day of enrolment to the study (day 1, Tier 1) and
284    additional serial samples obtained following a sampling schedule (Tier 2) harmonized with
285    international investigators to allow meaningful comparison of results between studies 21. Healthy
286    controls were recruited prior to December 2019 under approval from the London – Fulham Research
287    Ethics Committee (REC) (reference 14/LO/1023) or from healthy donors following informed consent
288    from a sub-collection of the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust National Institute for Health
289    Research Imperial Biomedical Research Centre Tissue Bank. Use of the sub-collection was approved
290    by the Tissue Bank Ethics Committee (Approval R12023). Samples from community managed COVID-
291    19 cases were collected through a subproject of Imperial College London Communicable Disease
292    Research Tissue Bank, under approval from the south central Oxford REC (reference 15/SC/0089).

294    To calculate partial HScores 24, ferritin, triglyceride and AST measurements from this study were
295    combined with recorded results from case report forms for temperature and routine hemoglobin,
296    white cell counts, and platelet counts.
297    Immunoassays
298    IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, CXCL8/IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70 and IL-13 were quantified using MSD
299    (Mesoscale Diagnostics, Rockville, Maryland, USA) V-Plex proinflammatory plates on a SQ120
300    Quickplex instrument. IL-1α, IL-1ra, IL-6Rα, angiopoetin-1, angiopoetin-2, endothelin-1, VEGF-D, D-
301    dimer, thrombomodulin, Tie2, von-Willebrand Factor-A2 (vWF-A2), G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-17A,
302    LCN2/NGAL, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 were quantified using a Bio Plex 200
303    instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA) with custom Luminex panel kits from Biotechne
304    (Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) and MilliporeSigma (Burlington, Massachusetts, USA). IFN-α was
305    quantified using Quanterix (Billerica, Massachusetts, USA) IFN-α assay kits on the SIMOA platform.
306    All values at or below the lower limit of detection (LLOD) were replaced with the geometric mean of
307    the lower limits of detection across plates for each assay.
308    Statistical analyses
309    Statistical analyses used GraphPad Prism v8.3.0 (GraphPad, La Jolla, California, USA) R version 3.6.1
310    and Python 3.7.3 with Pandas 1.0.3 and Seaborn 0.10.0. Non-parametric mediator data (as
311    determined by D’Agostino and Pearson normality test) were analyzed by ANOVA using Kruskal-Wallis
312    tests with Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons of patient groups within in time group. Non-
313    parametric two-way analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney U tests. Correlation matrix
314    analysis was performed using the R packages ggplot2 and ggcorrplot and Spearman’s test for
315    correlation of non-parametric data, after P-value adjustment for multiple testing. The false discovery
316    rate, or expected proportion of discoveries which are falsely rejected, was controlled using the
317    methods of Benjamini and Hochberg. Heatmaps of scaled plasma mediator data were generated
318    using the ComplexHeatmap package in R with rows and columns split by K-means clustering and
                                                                                                                                  14
