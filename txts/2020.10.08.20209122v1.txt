    ABSTRACT
    Aim: To estimate time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy and identify predictors among
    COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
    Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted among 244 consecutively admitted
    COVID-19 patients from July to September, 2020. Frequency tables, KM plots, median survival
    times and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival distribution
    between groups. Cox proportional hazard survival model was used to assess the presence of a
    statistically significant association between time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy and
    the independent variables, where hazard ratio, P-value and 95% CI for hazard ratio were used for
    testing significance and interpretation of results.
    Results: Median time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy among the studied population
    was 6 days. Factors that affect time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy were age group
    (HR= 0.522, 95% CI= 0.323, 0.844, p-value=0.008 for ≥ 70 years) and shortness of breath (HR=
    0.705, 95% CI= 0.519, 0.959, p-value=0.026).
    Conclusions: Average duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement among COVID-19
    patients was 6 days and being 70 years and older and having shortness of breath were found to be
    associated with prolonged duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement. This result can
    be used as a guide in planning institutional resource allocation and patient management to
    provide a well equipped care to prevent complications and death from the disease.
                                                                                                                                               1

    INTRODUCTION
    The 2019 corona virus disease was first identified in China on December 2019 and later spread
    to the entire world and declared to be a pandemic by world health organization on March 11,
    20201. In Ethiopia the first case was identified on March 13, 2020, two days after the pandemic
    was declared. According to the national report, as of October 5, 2020, 79,437 cases were
    identified with 34,016 recovered and 1230 deaths. Since the disease transmission dynamic
    shifted to a community transmission, the number of new cases, those who need critical care and
    daily deaths are increasing, with 292 cases on critical care at different treatment centers in the
    country on the same day 2. Considering the countries over burdened health care system,
    providing adequate care for COVID-19 patients who need hospitalization and especially
    supplemental oxygen therapy might be challenging if the pandemic continues.
    To halt the transmission of the dynamics and because of limited knowledge on the disease
    progression and outcome, at first every patient who tested positive for SARS-COV-2 used to be
    quarantined and observed till recovery (declared by two consecutive negative RT-PCR results
    which are done 24 hours apart). But eventually as the number of case increases the admission
    and discharge criteria changed in order to accommodate the service to those who needs it most,
    this was also applied in our country 3,4.
    Assessing the resources needed for admitted patients can be guided by the length of hospital stay
    or time needed to get biochemically or clinically improved. Assessing the later provides better
    detail about the disease effect on the patient and its burden on the health care system compared
    to assessing the length of stay per se as it also tells us the associated resource requirement during
    the hospital stay. In other words, a patient staying at a mild ward with no need of oxygen therapy
    or expensive antibiotics and someone on intensive care doesn’t cost the same to the institution.
    This implies that, hospital length of stay could be influenced by not only the clinical condition of
    the patient but also because of the existing policies that differ with time and place that is set to
    control the pandemic better. Therefore, using length of stay as a clinical parameter may be biased
    and should not be used as an end point to assess clinical improvement from the disease.
    Different studies are conducted that assessed the length of hospital stay of COVID-19 patients
    with a wide difference in reported values5-12. A systematic review that analyzed 45 studies
    conducted in different countries shows that the median length of hospital stay ranges from 4-53
    days in China and 4-21 days outside China 13. As explained above, these studies are influenced
    by the above changing criteria in admission and discharge that results in a different implication
    of length of hospital stay at different time of the pandemic and at different countries, one might
                                                                                                                                       2

    imply duration from getting diagnosed to getting negative and another might imply from time of
    becoming symptomatic to a week or two after getting symptom free.
    In addition, studies concerning biochemical recovery are conducted measuring the time from
    getting positive up to negative viral shedding as declared by two consecutive laboratory result of
    a RT-PCR that is done at least 24 hours apart14-18. Such kind of studies can provide an input in
    terms of understanding the viral shedding pattern so that decision about quarantine and self
    isolation can be made so that infection transmission can be minimized. Because of the change in
    the practice, being positive by itself is no more a criteria to guide patient admission and
    discharge. Thereby, its current cost implication to the health care system is minimal.
    Since the current hospitalization policy focused on those who are symptomatic and need
    medication or supplemental oxygen therapy, understanding the oxygen requirement of severe
    COVID-19 patients and what predicts it is important. Knowing average duration of supplemental
    oxygen requirement helps not only in identifying who is at most risk and should be protected but
    it also assists in deciding on building hospitals capacity in terms of oxygen facility arrangement
    and organizing ICU and wards with inbuilt supplemental oxygen system. To the best of our
    knowledge, there is no such study conducted yet in both Ethiopia and outside.
    Therefore, in this study we aimed to assess severe COVID-19 patients’ clinical improvement by
    measuring the time needed from admission and being on supplemental oxygen therapy to getting
    off supplemental oxygen therapy and its predictors among patients admitted to Millennium
    COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.
    METHODS AND MATERIALS
    Study setting and period
    The study was conducted at Millennium COVID-19 Care Center (MCCC), a makeshift hospital
    in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia.
    Study Design
    The study design was hospital based prospective observational design. The observation was
    made from July to September, 2020.
    Source and Study Population
    The source population was all severe cases of COVID-19 admitted at MCCC with a confirmed
    diagnosis of COVID-19 using RT-PCR, as reported by a laboratory given mandate to test such
    patients by the Ministry of Health and who were on follow up from July to September, 2020 3.
                                                                                                                                       3

    During this interval a total of 244 COVID-19 patients were admitted to the Center. All the 244
    patients were studied.
    Sample size Determination and Sampling Technique
    All consecutively admitted Severe COVID-19 patients during the follow up period were included
    in the study.
    Eligibility criteria
    All Severe COVID-19 patients who were on treatment and follow up at the MCCC from July to
    September, 2020 were included.
    Operational Definitions
    Event: Getting off supplemental oxygen therapy
    Censoring: Includes patients lost to follow-up, transferred out, died or completed the follow-up
    period before getting off supplemental oxygen therapy.
    Time to event or censoring: time between initiations of supplemental oxygen therapy to getting
    off oxygen supplement (in days).
    Data Collection Procedures and Quality Assurance
    An interviewer administered pretested questionnaire that consists of the variables of interest was
    developed from the patient registration and follow up form and used to collect the necessary data
    from the patients and their medical charts.
    Training on the basics of the questionnaire and data collection tool was given for ten data
    collectors (Bsc nurses and General practitioners) and two supervisors (General practitioner and
    public health specialist) for one day.
    Data consistency and completeness was checked before an attempt was made to enter the code
    and analyze the data.
    Data Management and Data Analysis
    The collected data was coded and entered into Epi-Info version 7.2.1.0, cleaned and stored and
    exported into SPSS version 23 for analysis. Frequency tables, Kaplan Meier (KM) plots and
    median survival times were used to describe the data. Survival experience of different groups
    was compared using KM survival curves. Log-rank test was used to assess significant difference
    among survival distributions of groups for equality.
    Univariate analysis was performed to calculate an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) and to screen out
    potentially significant independent variables at 25% level of significance. Association between
    the most relevant independent variables and the time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy
                                                                                                                                       4

    was assesses using multivariable Cox proportional hazard survival model. Adjusted HR, P-value
    and 95% CI for HR were used to test significance and interpretation of results. Variables with p-
    value ≤ 0.05 were considered as statistically associated with time to getting off supplemental
    oxygen therapy in days. The basic assumptions of Cox Proportional Hazard model was tested
    using log minus log function.
    RESULT
    Censoring status and median time to getting off oxygen
    Among the 244 patients, 191 (78.3%) of the patients achieved the event (getting off
    supplemental oxygen therapy) while 53 (21.7%) were censored.
    The median time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy was 6 days and it ranges from 2 to
    35 days.
    Socio-demographic, Co-morbid illness and drug use history, censoring status and survival
    experience
    Equal proportions (21.7%) of patients were included in the study in the age groups; below 40
    years, 60 to 69 years and ≥ 70 years. A smaller proportion was in 50 to 59 years. Two third
    (67.6%) of the patients were males. More than half (56.9%) had a history of one or more co-
    morbid illness. The greater proportion of the study participants were hypertensive (33.6%),
    followed by diabetes mellitus (28.7%), cardiac illness (11.9%) and asthma (6.1%). Thirty three
    (13.5%) had a history of ACEIs and/or ARBs and/or NSAID use within 14 days of admission to
    the center.
    In all of the variable categories, the number of event achieved is greater than the censored
    observation. The proportion of censored observation is relatively larger as age increases, for
    males, for those patients with one or more pre-existing comorbid illness history and Khat
    chewers. On the other, those with a history of drug use had a relatively less censored observation
    than those with no drug use history.
    The log rank test result shows that, there was a significant difference in the survival time among
    the patients based on age group, history of pre-existing co-morbid illness, hypertension and
    diabetes mellitus. Accordingly, the median duration of oxygen requirement is significantly
    longer for those patients ≥ 70 years (22 days) followed by 50 to 69 years (8 days) and then < 50
    years (6 days) (X2(4)= 15.162, P-value= 0.004). Having a history of one or more pre-existing
    comorbid illness (7 Vs 8 days, X2(4)= 4.449, P-value= 0.035), hypertension (7 Vs 9 days, X2(1)=
    5.204, P-value= 0.023) and diabetes mellitus (7 Vs 8 days, X2(1)= 6.773, P-value= 0.009) resulted
    in a prolonged oxygen therapy requirement compared to those with no such illness.
                                                                                                                                       5

    On the other hand, the survival time did not show statistically significant difference among the

    As shown in Figures 1 the KM survival function graph also showed that patients in the younger
    age group have a favorable survival experience compared to those who are in the immediate
    older age group. Similarly, both the survival and hazard function graphs showed that a favorable
    survival experience is observed among patients with no history of pre-existing co-morbid illness
    compared to those with one or more co-morbid illness/s.

    Two hundred thirty two (95.1%) of the patients were symptomatic at presentation. The most
    frequent complaint was cough (80.7%) followed by Shortness of breath (64.3%), Cough with
    sputum (47.5%), Fatigue (47.5%), Fever (34.8%), Chest pain (34.1%), Headache (24.6%),

    Arthralgia (19.7%), Myagia (16.8%), Sore throat (16.4%), Nausea/ vomiting (7.8%) and
    Diarrhea (5.7%).
    The proportion of patients who achieved the event was greater than the censored observation in
    all of the patients with the above symptom categories.
    According to the log rank test result, a significantly longer duration of oxygen therapy was
    needed among patients with a complaint of shortness of breath (8 days) compared to those with
    no such complaint (6 days) (X2(4)= 4.494, P-value= 0.034). On the contrary, the log rank test
    didn’t show any significant difference in the survival time among the other symptom groups (all
    p-values >0.05). (Table 2)

    As shown in Figures 2 the KM survival function graph also showed that those with no symptom
    of shortness of breath at admission have a favorable survival experience (time to getting off
    supplemental oxygen therapy) compared to those with such symptom. The hazard function also
    shows that, for those patients with no shortness of breath the instantaneous chance of getting off
    supplemental oxygen therapy increases as the duration of treatment increases.

    lines between groups indicate proportionality 19. Figures 3 shows that throughout the study time
    the survival curves seems to be parallel among the groups classified by age group and the
    presence of shortness of breath. Therefore, these plots show reasonable fit to the proportional
    hazard assumption.
                      Figure 3: Log minus Log function for age group and shortness of breath
    Univariate analysis of each independent variable with the dependent variable was run. From
    univariate analysis at 25% level of significance; age group, sex, cardiac illness, hypertension,
    diabetes and Shortness of breath were significantly associated with duration of supplemental
    oxygen therapy requirement among COVID-19 patients.
    However; only age group and a complaint of shortness of breath were found to be significantly
    associated with duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement in the multivariable Cox
    proportional hazard model at 5% level of significance.
    Accordingly, after adjusting for other covariates, the rate of getting off supplemental oxygen
    therapy among patients ≥ 70 years was 47.8% lower than patients < 40 years old (HR= 0.522,
    95% CI= 0.323, 0.844, p-value=0.008). This implies that the time needed to get off supplemental
    oxygen therapy was significantly longer among older patients compared with the younger
    patients.
    Having a complaint of shortness of breath at admission was associated with a 29.5% lower rate
    of achieving target of off oxygen therapy compared to those patients with no such complaint on
    admission (HR= 0.705, 95% CI= 0.519, 0.959, p-value=0.026). (Table 3)

    DISCUSSION
    The median time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy among the studied population was 6
    days. Previous studies that focused on length of hospital stay are conducted but there is no study
    that assessed duration of oxygen requirement5-13. Our study assessed this outcome as an indicator
    of clinical improvement from the disease as duration of stay is affected by national and
    international recommendations which varies from time to time based on admission and discharge
    criteria that might result in delayed discharge of patients till becoming non infectious even after
    clinical improvement. Knowing median duration of oxygen requirement assists in deciding on
    building hospitals capacity in terms of oxygen facility arrangement and organizing ICU and
    wards with inbuilt supplemental oxygen system so that maximum capacity can be used to
    provide better care to patients in the country.

    On the univariate analysis, age group, sex, cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and
    shortness of breath were found to be independent predictors of duration of oxygen requirement
    among COVID-19 patients. But on the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model, after
    adjusting for other covariates, only age group and shortness of breath were found to be
    significant predictors of duration of supplemental oxygen requirement among COVID-19
    patients.
    Accordingly, after adjusting for other covariates, the rate of getting off supplemental oxygen
    therapy among patients 70 years and above was 47.8% lower than patients less than 40 years old.
    This implies that the time needed to get off supplemental oxygen therapy was significantly
    longer among older patients compared with the younger patients. This could be because of the
    increased risk of having concomitant comorbid illness and the normal aging process that
    diminishes body’s defense mechanism. These factors result in a more severe disease progression
    with delayed recovery or death. Studies also support this finding showing that old age is
    associated with high risk of developing symptomatic disease, severe disease category and death
    from COVID-19 as compared to younger age group. Especially the patients 70 years and above
    were found to be vulnerable to much worse disease progression and outcome than other age
    groups20-23.
    Having a complaint of shortness of breath at admission was found to be associated with a
    significantly prolonged duration of supplemental oxygen requirement. The rate of getting off
    supplemental oxygen therapy among patients with shortness of breath was 29.5% lower
    compared to those patients with no such complaint on admission. Shortness of breath is a sign of
    lung disease. SARS-COV-2 can affect any part of the body system but the lungs are said to be
    more susceptible because the virus entry in to the body is made through the airways. The other
    reason is the abundance of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in the lungs that is used as a
    receptor by the SARS-COV-2 to enter in to the body cells. Also, if the individual develops
    pneumonia, it is usually going to affect both lungs compromising the lungs capacity and
    resulting in a drop in blood oxygen level. Because of these reasons, if the lungs got hit by the
    virus, it results in a more severe disease especially among those with underlying pulmonary
    disease resulting in a severe disease presentation and delayed recovery causing a prolonged
    oxygen requirement.
    On the other hand, the result shows that the duration of oxygen requirement doesn’t significantly
    differ based on sex and co-morbid illness/s history.
    CONCLUSION
    Average duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement among COVID-19 patients was 6
    days. This can be used as a guide in planning institutional oxygen requirement, bed demand at
    Intensive care unit and wards with inbuilt oxygen supply system, and in predicting patient turn
                                                                                                                                     12

    over at these units. This in turn can be used to predict institutional capacity to admit and treat
    patients who require oxygen therapy.
    Age group of 70 years and above and having shortness of breath were found to be associated
    with prolonged duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement. This implies that, earlier
    identification of disease progression is advised to identify these groups of patients so that early
    intervention and maximum care can be provided to prevent complication from the disease and
    the supplemental oxygen therapy itself.
