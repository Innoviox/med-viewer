   Key messages:
   What is already known on this topic?
   People with rare diseases often suffer worse health outcomes than people with more
   common diseases. Little is known about the risks to people with rare diseases during
   COVID-19. The OPENSAFELY study found people with common autoimmune diseases
   were at little increased risk due to COVID-19.
   What this study adds:
   This is the first study to quantify the risk of death among people with rare autoimmune
   rheumatic diseases (RAIRD) during COVID-19.

        •    When compared to before COVID-19, the risk of dying during COVID-19 for people
             with a rare autoimmune rheumatic disease increased from age 35 years onwards,
             whereas in the general population it increased from the age of 55 onwards.
        •    When adjusted for age, the risk of dying during COVID-19 was similar for men and
             women with a rare autoimmune rheumatic disease, whereas before COVID-19
             women with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases had a lower risk of death. This
             means women had a greater increase in their risk of death during COVID-19
             compared to men.
        •    For people of working age with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases, the risk of
             dying during the COVID-19 pandemic was similar to that of someone 20 years older
             in the general population.
   We urgently need to quantify how much risk is due to COVID-19 infection and how much
   due to disruption to healthcare services to inform better shielding advice, prioritisation of
   healthcare services, and vaccine priorities for people with rare diseases.

   Abstract (316 words)
   Objectives To quantify the risk of death among people with rare autoimmune rheumatic
   diseases (RAIRD) during the UK 2020 COVID-19 epidemic compared with baseline risk and
   the risk of death in the general population during COVID-19.
   Design A cohort study using data from the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease
   Registration Service (NCARDRS). We used ONS published data for general population
   mortality rates.
   Setting Hospital Episode Statistics for England 2003 onwards, and linked data from the
   NHS Personal Demographics Service.
   Participants 168,691 people with RAIRD who were alive on 1 March 2020. Their median
   age was 61.7 (IQR 41.5-75.4) years, and 118,379 (70.2%) were female. Our case
   ascertainment methods had a positive predictive value >85%.
   Main outcome measure Age-standardised mortality rates for all-cause death. Secondary
   outcome measures were age-sex standardised mortality rates, and age-stratified mortality
   rates.
   Results 1,815 (1.1%) participants died during March and April 2020. The age-standardised
   mortality rate (ASMR) among people with RAIRD (3669.3, 95% CI 3500.4-3838.1 per
   100,000 person-years) was 1.44 (95% CI 1.42-1.45) times higher than the average ASMR
   during the same months of the previous 5 years, whereas in the general population of
   England it was 1.38 times higher. Compared to the general population, the age-specific
   mortality rates in people with RAIRD compared to the pre-COVID rates were higher from the
   age of 35 upwards, whereas in the general population the increased risk began from age 55
   upwards. Sex-specific mortality rates were similar in males and females, whereas pre-
   COVID women with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases had lower mortality rates. This
   means women had a greater increase in mortality rates during COVID-19 compared to men.
   Conclusions The risk of all-cause death is more prominently raised during COVID-19
   among people with RAIRD than among the general population. We urgently need to quantify
   how much risk is due to COVID-19 infection and how much is due to disruption to healthcare
   services, in order to inform better guidance about shielding, access to healthcare and
   vaccine priorities for people with rare diseases.

   Introduction
   There are limited data, and no whole population studies, on the impact of COVID 19 on
   people with rare diseases. This is important to inform shielding advice for people with rare
   diseases, and also to communicate realistic levels of risk as they apply to different groups
   and allow informed personal choices (1). There is also a risk that the known discrepancy in
   outcomes and access to treatment between rare and common diseases will widen, leading
   to more health inequality.
   We have studied the risk of death during the 2020 UK COVID-19 epidemic across rare
   autoimmune rheumatic diseases (RAIRD) because they are an exemplar group of non-
   genetic conditions that share similar clinical features and treatments. People with these
   conditions have slightly increased mortality compared to the general population, and many
   are treated with immunosuppression, meaning that they may be at increased risk both due to
   COVID-19 infection and from their disease when healthcare services are disrupted.
   However, their risk during COVID-19 has not been quantified. Using linked national health
   records for the whole population of England we have estimated the risk of death among
   people with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases during March and April 2020, at the
   beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, and compared this to 1) their risk before
   COVID-19 and 2) the risk of death in the general population during COVID-19.


   Methods
   The Registration of Complex Rare Diseases Exemplars in Rheumatology (RECORDER)
   project is a collaboration between the University of Nottingham, and the National Congenital
   Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) within Public Health England.
   NCARDRS registers people with congenital abnormalities and rare diseases across the
   whole of England. Currently there is no routine notification to NCARDRS by healthcare
   providers of people with rare diseases that are non-genetic and occur after infancy(2,3).
   RECORDER has established the methodologies for identification, validation and registration
   with NCARDRS of people who have later onset, non-genetic rare diseases, using rare
   autoimmune rheumatic diseases as an exemplar group of conditions. This has been enabled
   through NCARDRS access to national routinely collected healthcare datasets, such as
   Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). HES contains every episode of admitted NHS patient care
   in England (in-patient and day-case), with all prevalent diagnoses coded according to ICD-
   10. Importantly, each of the rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases maps to a unique ICD-10
   code that does not also include other conditions, and patients with these conditions also
   have frequent in-patient or day-case activity, making them ideal for identification in HES.
   We have previously validated ascertaining diagnoses of vasculitis (ANCA-associated
   vasculitis, Takayasu arteritis and Kawasaki disease) in HES, with positive predictive values
   (PPV) over 85%(4). For this study we have used NCARDRS legal permissions and data
   sharing agreements with NHS Trusts in England to validate additional diagnoses, confirming
   diagnoses in two hospital Trusts using hospital notes of 430 randomly selected people with
   coded diagnoses of systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, idiopathic inflammatory
   myositis, Behcet’s disease, giant cell arteritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (see code list in
   data annex).
   We included people who had a diagnostic code for a rare autoimmune rheumatic disease in
   in-patient HES from 2003 onwards, were resident in England, and who were alive on 1
   March 2020. We used data from the NHS Personal Demographics Service, linked by NHS
   number and date of birth, to ascertain whether people were alive or dead, and their date of
   death(5). Authors extracted data from the whole HES dataset themselves. A data flow

   diagram is shown in figure 1. The data did not require further cleaning after building the
   cohort. We calculated the mortality rate during March and April 2020, using the cohort of
   people with rare autoimmune rheumatic conditions as the denominator population. We
   repeated the calculation for mortality rates during March and April for each of the 5 previous
   years for comparison. We converted all rates into age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs)
   per 100,000 population, standardised to the 2013 European Standard Population. We
   calculated sex-specific mortality rates, including ASMRs however it should be noted that the
   European standard population is not disaggregated by sex, meaning it assumes equal
   numbers of males and females, and identical distributions by age for males and for females.
   The World Health Organisation and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) therefore advise
   focusing on age-standardised rates rather than age-sex standardised rates for headline
   measures. Age-specific mortality rates per 100,000 people were calculated in 10-year age
   bands for comparison to data on the whole population of England.
   We accessed publicly available data from the ONS statistical bulletin on “Deaths involving
   COVID-19, UK: deaths occurring between 1 March and 30 April 2020” to compare our crude,
   age-standardised and age-specific mortality rates to the whole population of England during
   the same time period(6).
   This study received a favourable opinion from the Camden and Kings Cross Research
   Ethics Committee, study reference 20/HRA/2076, on 18 June 2020. Data were accessed
   and processed under section 251 permission granted to NCARDRS CAG 10-02(d)/2015).
   For quality assurance the data extraction and analysis were re-conducted by an independent
   analyst from the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS).
   Patient and public involvement: This project was discussed with and the aims supported by
   the Rare Autoimmune Rheumatic Disease Alliance of patient charities(7). A lay summary is
   available as an online supplement, and the results are being discussed with patients and
   representatives of the RAIRDA charities and disseminated to patients via their networks.
   Data access: NCARDRS data are available to all who have a legal basis to access them.
   Further information is available at by application to Public Health England’s Office for data
   release(8).

   Results
   We identified 168,691 people with RAIRD diagnoses in HES who were alive on 1 March
   2020 (figure 1). Validation of 430 cases found that our methods correctly identified 368
   people with RAIRD, giving a PPV 85.63% (95% CI 81.9-88.8%). The characteristics of the
   cohort are shown in table 1.

   During March and April 2020 1,815 (1.1%) of people with a RAIRD died (of any cause).
   Crude and age-standardised mortality rates are shown in table 2. The crude mortality rate
   was 6481.4 (95% CI 6190.0-6786.5) per 100,000 person-years, and the age-standardised
   mortality rate (ASMR) was 3669.3 (3500.4-3838.1) per 100,000 person-years. The mortality
   rate in March and April 2020 was higher than during March and April over the previous 5
   years (Mean ASMR for March and April 2015-2019 was 2554.2). The ratio of the ASMR in
   March and April 2020 compared to the mean ASMR in March and April 2015-2019 was 1.44
   (95% CI 1.42-1.45).
   In the whole population of England, the ASMR reported by the ONS for the UK during March
   and April 2020 was 1361.1 (1353.6- 1368.7) per 100,000 people, compared to 3669.3
   (3500.4-3838.1) per 100,000 person-years among people with RAIRD. The 5-year average
   for March and April 2015-2019 in England was 983.3 (980.3-986.3) per 100,000. The ratio of
   the 2020 value to the 5-year average was 1.38. The ratio of the ASMR in 2020 to the
   average of the previous 5 years was a little higher in people with RAIRD (1.44; 95% CI 1.42-
   1.45) compared to the whole population (1.38) and 2.7 times higher than the ASMR for the
   general population of England during March and April 2020, compared to 2.6 times higher on
   average over the previous 5 years.

   Methodological note: Applying the European standard population which is not disaggregated
   by sex, (meaning it assumes equal numbers of males and females, and identical
   distributions by age for males and for females) means the age-sex standardised mortality
   rates are higher than the age-standardised mortality rate for this distribution of data.

   Age-specific mortality rates
   Age-specific mortality rates during March and April 2020 in people with RAIRD compared to
   the whole population of the UK (data for England were not available) are shown in Figure 2
   and Table 4. The rates of death among people with RAIRD were higher at each age-group
   than in the general population, and higher during COVID-19 than in 2019. The 20-29 years
   age-group was the youngest age-group we could report on due to small numbers in the
   younger groups.

   Discussion
       • Statement of principal findings
   We provide the first evidence of the risk of death during COVID-19 in people with rare
   autoimmune rheumatic conditions compared to the risk not during COVID-19, as well as
   compared to the general population. The increased risk of death compared to the pre-
   COVID risk among people with RAIRD was slightly higher than in the general population.
   The risk was similar in males and females, in contrast to the risk in the general population
   where it is higher in males. When comparing risks of death during COVID-19 to pre-COVID-
   19, people with RAIRD had an increased risk of death from age 35 upwards, whereas in the
   general population the increased risk occurred from around age 55 upwards. Because the
   protective effect of being female is not seen in RAIRD, the group at the largest increase of
   risk compared to their pre-COVID-19 risk were women aged 35 upwards.
   The absolute risk of all-cause death for someone aged 20-29 with RAIRD was similar to
   someone in the general population aged >20 years older, and 40-49 years with RAIRD
   similar to someone in the general population 20 years older, and someone aged 60-69 with
   RAIRD was similar to someone in the general population aged >10 years older.
   • Strengths and weaknesses of the study
   One key strength of this study is our ability to use a validated method of population-based
   case ascertainment in the whole English population of 55 million. Rare diseases are difficult
   to study, because not many people are affected by each disease(9). The best way to study
   risk in rare diseases is in whole population-based studies, enabled now in England by the
   unique capability of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service
   within Public Health England.
   We ascertained cases from HES, which has been shown to have high coding accuracy for
   diagnostic ICD codes(10). Our validation work confirms this methodology is robust, with
   PPV>85%. Although some of our cases (less than 15%) may not therefore have a rare
   disease, as a result they are likely to be at lower risk of poor outcome. This may attenuate
   any effect we detected, so our results should be seen as a lower limit/underestimate. Other
   weaknesses are that by identifying cases using in-patient data we may miss patients only
   treated as outpatients, which are not routinely coded in HES. We have included primary and
   co-morbid diagnoses to maximise sensitivity, and prevalence estimates based on our
   findings for AAV, systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma, are similar to reported
   population estimates(11–13).
   • Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies, discussing important differences in
   results
   Recently the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) reported “no evidence that
   people with rheumatic musculoskeletal disorders face more risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2
   than individuals without rheumatic musculoskeletal disorders, nor that they have a worse
   prognosis when they contract it.” (14) No evidence was presented on the risk to people with
   RAIRD compared to the general population. Our study provides the first evidence of this risk,
   and suggests that people with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases are at higher risk of
   death during COVID-19 than the general population.
   The recent OPENSAFELY study, reported on the risk of in-hospital death due to COVID-19
   among >17 million community based adults(15). The analysis included “common
   autoimmune diseases” reporting the combined risk for people with rheumatoid arthritis, lupus
   or psoriasis. However, because it does not have whole population coverage, even the large
   OPENSAFELY study does not have a sufficiently large cohort to study rare diseases. The

                                                                                                                              11

   adjusted hazard ratio for common autoimmune diseases was 1.23 (95% CI 1.12-1.35)
   compared to our overall ASMR for RAIRD which was 2.7 times higher than the ASMR for the
   general population of England. OPENSAFELY report in hospital deaths due to COVID-19,
   whereas we report all-cause deaths, and OPENSAFELY included a wider group of people
   with autoimmune diseases, which are likely to confer a lower risk than the rare autoimmune
   rheumatic diseases.
   • Meaning of the study: possible explanations and implications for clinicians and
   policymakers
   People with RAIRD have an excess risk of death during COVID 19 which starts at a younger
   age than in the general population, and is particularly prominent in young females. It is
   possible that this increased risk relates to both specific COVID infection risks but also could
   be due to the effects of change in consulting behaviour, and disruption to NHS services for
   rare diseases. For newly diagnosed patients their long “diagnostic odyssey” is likely to have
   been prolonged even further by closure of departments to routine referrals and they may be
   more unwell at diagnosis. Barriers to ongoing care because of strict social distancing policies
   might also be particularly relevant, as this population has a high prevalence of shielding
   (16,17).
   This work supports the prioritisation of RAIRD highlighted in NHS England guidance for
   primary and secondary care, principles that need to continue during service restoration to
   reduce risk of avoidable harm to this group (18,19).
   There are implications for future risk assessments. At present COVID-age, the most
   frequently used workplace risk assessment tool for COVID and does not include rare
   disease risks, and so would underestimate the risks particularly to young and/or female
   people with RAIRD(20). The planned COVID-19 risk prediction model commissioned by
   Office of the Chief Medical Officer for England to NERVTAG has published their protocol
   which includes common and rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases grouped together with
   non-immune diseases such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome which will underestimate the risk in
   RAIRD. In addition this group are often treated with immunosuppression or high cost biologic
   drugs prescribed or administered in hospital which will not be available in their datasets. The
   protocol also excludes a large group of young people with the RAIRD diagnoses of juvenile
   idiopathic arthritis and Takayasu’s arteritis; and other vasculitides such as granulomatosis
   with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis(21).
   These results also highlight the unique capability of the National Congenital Anomaly and
   Rare Disease Registration Service to inform population level strategies to support and
   protect the health of people with rare diseases (22,23). Current risk stratifications broadly
   assume that young people are not at increased risk of poor outcome from COVID-19 and do
   not need to “shield”. Our initial results challenge this and also have implications for
   prioritisation of vaccination in at-risk groups. (24,25).
   • Unanswered questions and future research
   This study looks at all-cause mortality. Further research is urgently needed on the causes of
   death to understand the how many people are dying of COVID-19 and how many due to
   other causes, as well as the effect of ethnicity, immunosuppression and steroid usage on
   risks for people with RAIRD.
   Conclusion: The excess risk of all-cause death during COVID-19 occurs at a younger age
   among people with RAIRD than among the general population and particularly affects
   females. We urgently need to quantify how much risk is due to COVID-19 infection and how

                                                                                                                              12
