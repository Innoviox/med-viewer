    35       Abstract:
    36       The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 vary broadly, ranging from asymptomatic
    37       infection to acute respiratory failure and death. But the predictive biomarkers for
    38       characterizing the variability are still lacking. Since emerging evidence indicates that
    39       extracellular vesicles (EVs) and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) are functionally involved
    40       in a number of pathological processes, we hypothesize that these extracellular
    41       components may be key determinants and/or predictors of COVID-19 severity. To test
    42       our hypothesis, we collected serum samples from 31 patients with mild COVID-19
    43       symptoms at the time of their admission. After standard therapy without corticosteroids,
    44       9 of the 31 patients developed severe COVID-19 symptoms. We analyzed EV protein
    45       and exRNA profiles to look for correlations between these profiles and COVID-19
    46       severity. Strikingly, we identified three distinct groups of markers (antiviral
    47       response-related EV proteins, coagulation-related markers, and liver damage-related
    48       exRNAs) with the potential to serve as early predictive biomarkers for COVID-19
    49       severity. Among these markers, EV COPB2 has the best predictive value for severe
    50       deterioration of COVID-19 patients in this cohort. This type of information concerning
    51       functional extracellular component profiles could have great value for patient
                                                                       3

    55       Introduction
    56                      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is
    57       responsible for a rapidly-unfolding pandemic that is overwhelming health care systems
    58       worldwide 1. The majority of Coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients exhibit
    59       mild clinical symptoms, including fever, cough, and sputum. In some cases, more
    60       severe symptoms such as dyspnea and/or hypoxemia occur after 1 week, with 50% of
    61       these severely-affected patients quickly progressing to systemic, life-threatening
    62       disorders, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock,
    63       refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulation disorders, and multiple organ failure 2. These
    64       problems lead to both mild and severe respiratory manifestations, the latter being
    65       prominent in the elderly and in those with underlying medical conditions such as
    66       cardiovascular and chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, and cancer 2. The main clinical
    67       feature of severe COVID-19 is the onset of ARDS 3. It has been reported that the rate of
    68       occurrence of ARDS in patients with severe COVID-19 is 15.9%-29% 2,4. The immune
    69       response that is vital for the control and resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infections can also
    70       lead to cellular damage in association with systemic deteriorations. Recent studies
    71       suggest that an exaggerated inflammatory response known as cytokine storm may play a
                                                                       5

    72       key role in this process 5. The variability of patient responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection
    73       makes it difficult to identify individuals who may be most at-risk for severe responses
    74       to the disease and to create early strategies for treating the disease. Although PCR-based
    75       detection of SARS-CoV-2 is useful for accurately diagnosing the disease, there is no
    76       available tool for effectively predicting disease severity or likely trajectories of illness
    77       progression 6.
    78                      Early identification of COVID-19 patients who may experience severe disease
    79       deterioration is of great significance for improving clinical approaches that will result in
    80       reduced mortality. Accordingly, the purpose of our study has been to identify
    81       extracellular components that can serve as useful biomarkers for predicting disease
    82       progression in COVID-19 patients. Toward this end we have focused on identifying the
    83       profiles of extracellular vesicle (EV) proteins and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) in
    84       serum samples taken from COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms at the time of their
    85       admission for medical treatment.
    86                      Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, contain
    87       numerous and diverse bio-molecules such as RNAs and proteins within the vesicleâ€™s
    88       lipid bilayer 7. This stable bilayer construction enables intact EVs to circulate through
                                                                       6

    89       body fluids. Thus, EVs can transfer their cargo to target cells as a means of regulating
    90       target cell participation in both physiological and pathological processes, including host
    91       immune responses. EVs are characterized by a number of exosomal markers, including
    92       members of the tetraspanin family (CD9, CD63, CD81), components of the endosomal
    93       sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) (TSG101, Alix), heat shock proteins
    94       (Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsp90), and RAB proteins (RAB27a/b)8. Accumulating evidence
    95       suggests that the size, membrane composition, and contents of EVs are highly
    96       heterogeneous, depending on the cellular source. Furthermore, EV cargoes can be
    97       dynamically altered by microenvironmental stimuli including viral infection. The EVs
    98       produced by both immune and non-immune cells can be responsible for regulating the
    99       nature of the immune response as it relates to inflammation, autoimmunity, and
   100       infectious disease pathology 9. EVs derived from virus-infected cells have been shown
   101       not only to modulate immune cell responses, but also to spread the viral infection via
                                                                                                     10

   103       have receptors for coronavirus entry such as CD9 11 and angiotensin-converting enzyme

   105       SARS-CoV-2 infection. For these reasons, evaluating the molecular profiles of
                                                                       7

   106       circulating EVs in COVID-19 patients may provide clues for understanding the host
   107       antiviral immune response and the mechanisms that determine disease trajectory and
   108       patient deterioration.
   109                      Studies of extracellular RNA (exRNA) have recently broadened into an
   110       important area of research with relevance to disease biomarker discovery and
                                  13
   111       therapeutics            . Most exRNAs are protected from degradation in biofluids via
   112       incorporation into EVs or into complexes with lipids and proteins. The variety of
   113       exRNA species that have been identified include messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and
   114       non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs), small nuclear RNAs, transfer RNAs,
   115       and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). During the early stages of viral infection, host
   116       non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs are produced and released as a part of the antiviral
   117       response that is aimed either directly or indirectly at targeting viral transcription,
                                                       14
   118       translation, and replication                . ExRNAs mediate a complex network of interactions
   119       between the virus and infected host cells, representing a pivotal role in modulating the
                                                        15
   120       host innate immune system                     . These findings suggest that exRNAs may have the
   121       potential to serve as biomarkers for evaluating the antiviral responses mounted by
   122       COVID-19 patients.

   124       Results
   125       Baseline clinical characteristics of the patient cohort
   126                      For this retrospective, single-center study, 31 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients
   127       and 10 uninfected healthy donors were included in the patient cohort. At the time of
   128       patient admission for treatment, serum samples were taken from all 41 individuals as a
   129       source of material for identifying biomarkers (Table S1). The severity of COVID-19
   130       disease in each patient was graded using the WHO ordinal outcome scale of clinical
   131       improvement (Table S2). At the time of admission, all COVID-19 patients were scored
   132       as having a mild status (WHO score                     =  3). Based on the clinical course of disease
   133       progression after admission, we divided the 31 COVID-19 patients into two groups:
   134       Group 1 included patients who retained their mild status (WHO score â‰¦ 4), and Group 2
   135       included patients who progressed to severe status (WHO score                        â‰§ 5) (Figure S1a). All
   136       patients in Group 1 were subsequently discharged in good health from the hospital or
   137       transferred to the local medical facility for further observation. In Group 2, two patients
   138       (22.2%) died from COVID-19 complications (pulmonary embolism (n=1) or ARDS
   139       (n=1)), and two patients (22.2%) remained hospitalized at the time of writing. All other
   140       patients in Group 2 were discharged in good health from the hospital following
                                                                      10

   141       treatment (Table S1). Clinical parameters were comparable among the groups (Table
   142       S3). Healthy donors and COVID-19 patients (Group 1 & 2) did not differ with respect
   143       to age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking index, levels of blood urea nitrogen
   144       (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), history of hypertension,
   145       diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease (P>0.05). Significant
   146       differences were observed in white blood cell (WBC) count and levels of C-reactive
   147       protein (CRP) (P <0.05). Comparison of COVID-19 patients in Group 1 and Group 2
   148       revealed no significant difference in sex, BMI, WBC count, BUN, Cr, creatine kinase
   149       (CK), D-dimer, and fibrinogen, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia,
   150       and coronary heart disease (P >0.05). However, significant differences were observed
   151       with respect to age, smoking index, and levels of CRP and ALT (P <0.05). We selected
   152       these 4 parameters for Pearsonâ€™s correlation analysis to identify correlations between
   153       the three groups in terms of age, smoking index, CRP, and ALT (Figure S1b). There

   158                      We performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis on combined
   159       Group1 and Group 2 to provide a robust test of sensitivity, specificity, and area under
   160       the curve (AUC) for our set of four predictive parameters (Figure S1c). The AUC
   161       values for the four factors (age, smoking index, CRP, and ALT) were 0.90 (95% CI:

   163       0.51-0.94), respectively. These findings suggest that at the time of admission to the
   164       hospital, age and CRP, having AUC values > 0.75, can provide the greatest
   165       discrimination between patients who will develop mild versus severe COVID-19.
   166                      Based on the ROC analysis, optimal cutoffs for the 4 parameters were
   167       identified via use of the Youden index (Table S6). For further analysis, we used these
   168       cutoffs to separate COVID-19 patients into low and high groups for comparing the
   169       incidence of severe COVID-19 related events. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed
   170       for each of the four parameters to compare the high and low groups for time-to-onset of
   171       a severe event (beginning with the day of admission) (Figure S1d). The
   172       progression-free times for age and CRP were significantly shorter in the high group than
   173       in the low group (P=3.9Ã—10-6; P=0.014, respectively). These findings suggest that the
   174       parameters of patient age and CRP can be useful at the time of admission to predict the
                                                                      12

   180       LC-MS analysis of proteome profiles from EVs in serum samples from COVID-19
   181       patients and uninfected controls
   182       In clinical settings, analysis of EVs from liquid biopsies has gained attention as a
   183       potential means of identifying diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for various
   184       diseases. However, this strategy has not yet been widely used due to a lack of
   185       standardized methods for isolating EVs from patients. To improve on this situation, we
   186       have employed an immunoprecipitation (IP) based method that targets surface marker
   187       proteins for rapid and specific isolation of EVs. The use of IP in the presence of a
   188       chelating reagent improves the yield and purity of CD9+ or CD63+ positive EVs from
   189       serum samples. The resulting EV preparations are suitable for subsequent EV proteome
   190       analysis by LC-MS (Figure 1a). From our total of 41 serum samples, LC-MS analysis
   191       identified 1676 proteins, following exclusion of proteins that were not present in all
                                                                      13

   192       samples. Of these 1676 proteins, a total 723 proteins were present at different levels
   193       between the three groups (P<0.05; one-way ANOVA). To compare the pattern of
   194       expression of these 723 EV proteins among the three patient cohorts, we used
   195       unsupervised multivariate statistics based on principal component analysis (PCA)
   196       mapping. PCA plots the first and second principal components (PC1 and PC2) using all
   197       the term frequency from the LC-MS data, showing a certain degree of separated trends
   198       between the three groups (Figure 1b). This differentiation could be described by the
   199       first PC1, which accounted for 28.1% of the variance. The second PC2 accounted for
   200       14.5% of the variance. This observation indicated that the EV proteome profiles of
   201       serum in COVID-19 patients deviated considerably from those uninfected donors.
   202       Although a little overlap or dispersity was demonstrated, we found obvious EV
   203       proteomic differences between Group 1 and Group 2 in the PCA scores plot.

   207       analysis for each of the selected proteins. From the candidate proteins, we have listed 91
   208       proteins with cross-validation scores >0.75 (Table S4). Further, we show the abundance
                                                                      14

   209       of the top 9 proteins with cross-validation scores >0.85 between the three patient groups
   210       (Figure 1c). Among these most-abundant proteins, four proteins [COPI coat complex
   211       subunit beta 2 (COPB2), KRAS proto-oncogene (KRAS), protein kinase C beta
   212       (PRKCB), and ras homolog family member C (RHOC)] are significantly more abundant
   213       in Group 1 than in Group 2 or in uninfected controls (P trend >0.05). Furthermore,
   214       CD147, calpain 2 (CAPN2), extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1), fibrinogen gamma
   215       chain (FGG) were significantly more abundant in Group 2 than in uninfected controls or
   216       in Group 1 (P trend <0.05). Only microfibril associated protein 4 (MFAP4) was less
   217       abundant in Group 1 than in uninfected controls or in Group 2 (P trend >0.05).

   219       Predictive value of 9 EV proteins for COVID-19 severity
   220                      We performed ROC analysis for combined Group1 and Group 2 to provide a
   221       robust test of sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for our set of nine predictive markers
   222       (Figure 1d). The AUC values for the four markers with enhanced abundance in Group
   223       1, COPB2, KRAS, PRKCM, and RHOC, were 1.00 (95% CI: 1.00-1.00), 0.93 (95% CI:
   224       0.85-1.00), 0.93 (95% CI: 0.83-1.00), and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.89-1.00), respectively. AUC
   225       values for the other five markers, CD147, CAPN2, ECM1, FGG, and MFAP4, were
                                                                      15

   227       (95% CI: 0.73-1.00), and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.52-0.97), respectively. Our analysis suggests
   228       that this set of markers, examined at the time of patient admission to the hospital,
   229       provides a significant degree of separation between patients that will develop mild
   230       versus severe COVID-19.
   231                      Additional ROC curves were generated to identify optimal cutoff values for
   232       the 9 marker proteins according to the Youden index (Table S6). For further analysis,
   233       we used the cutoff values to separate COVID-19 patients into low and high groups for
   234       comparing the onset of severe COVID-19 related events. Kaplan-Meier curves for the
   235       time-to-onset of a severe event were constructed for each of the 9 proteins (Figure 1e).
   236       Progression-free times for COPB2, KRAS, PRKCM, and RHOC, proteins with
   237       enhanced abundance in Group 1, were significantly shorter in the low group than in the
   238       high group (P=9.8Ã—10-10; P=1.0Ã—10-5; P=5.1Ã—10-7; P=4.2Ã—10-8, respectively).
   239       Conversely, the progression-free times for CD147, CAPN2, ECM1, FGG, and MFAP4,
   240       proteins with enhanced abundance in Group 2, were significant shorter in the high
   241       group than in the low group (P=7.0Ã—10-5; P=0.00060; P=2.2Ã—10-5; P=1.9Ã—10-7;
   242       P=2.0Ã—10-6, respectively). These results reinforce the concept that this set of markers
                                                                      16

   246       NGS determination of ExRNA profiles in serum samples from COVID-19 patients
   247       and uninfected controls
   248                      Circulating exRNAs have the potential to serve as biomarkers for a wide
   249       range of diseases. ExRNAs consist of diverse RNA subpopulations that are protected
   250       from degradation by incorporation into EVs or by association with lipids and/or proteins.
   251       ExRNA profiles in blood samples are dynamic and include mRNAs, miRNAs, piRNAs,
                                    18
   252       and lncRNAs              . Here we have used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze
   253       exRNAs present in patient serum samples (Figure 2a). From our 41 serum samples,
   254       NGS analysis identified 408 transcripts, excluding transcripts with fewer than 50 reads
   255       in all samples. Of these exRNAs, 43 transcripts were differentially expressed between
   256       the three patient groups (P<0.05; one-way ANOVA). To identify patterns of expression
   257       for these 43 transcripts among the three groups, we performed unsupervised
   258       multivariate statistics based on PCA mapping. PCA plots from the NGS data revealed a
   259       trend toward separation between the three groups (Figure 2b). This separation could be
                                                                       17

   260       described by the first PC1, which accounted for 28.1% of the variance. The second PC2
   261       accounted for 14.5% of the variance. These observations indicate that the serum exRNA
   262       profiles in COVID-19 patients deviate considerably from those in uninfected donors.
   263       Moreover, despite some overlap or dispersity, the PCA plots allow us to detect obvious
   264       differences in exRNA profiles between Group 1 and Group 2.
   265                      For discrimination between Group 1 and Group 2, a cross-validation score
   266       was calculated for each of the selected transcripts on the basis of Fisher linear
   267       discriminant analysis, much as described for our analysis of EV proteomes. From the
   268       candidate transcripts, we chose 14 transcripts with cross-validation scores >0.75 (Table
   269       S5). Figure 2c compares the three patient groups for expression of the top 6 transcripts
   270       with cross-validation scores>0.80. These species include miR-122-5p, small nucleolar
   271       RNA C/D Box 33 (SNORD33), AL732437.2, RNA U2 small nuclear 29 Pseudogene
   272       (RNU2-29P), CDKN2B antisense RNA1 (CDKN2B-AS1), and AL365184.1 (this
   273       transcript has 5 different transcript IDs). Notably, the four transcripts SNORD33,
   274       AL732437.2, CDKN2B-AS1, and AL365184.1 exhibit significantly higher levels of
   275       expression in Group 2 than in uninfected controls or Group 1 (P trend <0.05).

   277       Predictive value of 6 exRNAs for COVID-19 severity
   278                      Next, we constructed ROC curves for Group1 and Group 2 to provide a robust
   279       test of sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values for our set of 6 predictive exRNA
   280       markers (Figure 2d). AUC values for the transcripts miR-122-5p, SNORD33,
   281       AL732437.2, RNU2-29P, CDKN2B-AS1, and AL365184.1 were 0.81 (95% CI:
   282       0.64-0.99), 0.89 (95% CI: 0.78-1.00), 0.80 (95% CI: 0.60-1.00), 0.70 (95% CI:
   283       0.49-1.92), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.71-1.00), and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.78-1.00), respectively. This
   284       AUC analysis indicates that these exRNAs can provide a good basis for discriminating
   285       between mild and severe COVID-19 cases at the time of patient admission.
   286                      Additional ROC curves were generated to identify optimal cutoff values for
   287       the 6 transcripts according to the Youden index (Table S6). Using these cutoff values,
   288       we separated COVID-19 patients into low and high groups for determining the
   289       incidence of severe COVID-19 related events. Kaplan-Meier curves for time-to-onset of
   290       a severe event after admission were analyzed for each of the 6 transcripts (Figure 2e).
   291       The progression-free times for miR-122-5p, SNORD33, AL732437.2, RNU2-29P,
   292       CDKN2B-AS1, and AL365184.1 were all significantly faster in the high group than in
   293       the low group (P=2.1Ã—10-5; P=0.00022; P=0.0067; P=3.8Ã—10-5; P=3.3Ã—10-6; P=0.0009,

   295       the incidence of severe COVID-19 related events at the time of patient admission to the
   296       hospital.
   297
   298       The correlation between the selected markers for predicting disease severity values
   299                      Next we used univariate Cox regression analysis to calculate the hazard ratio
   300       (HR) for each of the EV and exRNA markers. Notably, the HR for COBP2 low was
   301       statistically incalculable using the optimal cut-off value, suggesting that EV COPB2 has
   302       the best predictive value among the two sets of markers. Furthermore, age high (HR
   303       28.1; 95% CI 3.4-231.9; P=0.0019), CRP high (HR 8.4; 95% CI 1-67.5; P=0.045),
   304       PRKCB low (HR 32.1; 95% CI 3.9-261.9; P=0.0012), RHOC low (HR 23.6; 95% CI
   305       4.7-118; P=0.00012), CD147 high (HR 10.7; 95% CI 2.5-45.1; P=0.0013), CAPN2
   306       high (HR 15.5; 95% CI 1.9-125.9; P=0.010), ECM1 high (HR 11.6; 95% CI 2.8-48.4;
   307       P=0.00079), FGG high (HR 21.4; 95% CI 4.2-110.4; P=0.00025), MFAP4 high (HR
   308       12.7; 95% CI 3.3-48.6; P=0.00022), miR-122-5p high (HR 10.5; 95% CI 2.7-40.4;
   309       P=0.00063), AL732437.2 high (HR 9.9; 95% CI 1.2-79.9; P=0.031), RNU2-29P high
   310       (HR 10.4; 95% CI 2.6-40.8; P=0.00081), CDKN2B-AS1 high (HR 14.4; 95% CI
                                                                      20

   311       3.4-61.3; P=0.00031), and AL365184.1 high (HR 14.2; 95% CI 1.8-114.4; P=0.013)
   312       were statistically significant (Table S6).
   313                      To investigate potential relationships between the selected markers,
   314       Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficients were calculated based on marker levels. A
   315       correlation plot was constructed to visualize the correlation coefficients of the 19
   316       markers (Figure 3). This allowed identification of four hierarchical clusters of markers
   317       that share strong positive correlations within the groups to which they belong. Each
   318       marker appears to fit into one of the four well defined clusters (namely, cluster 1, 2, 3,
   319       and 4). Notably, we observe that cluster 1 (PRKCB, RHOC, COPB2, and KRAS) is
   320       negatively correlated with the other clusters. Clusters 2, 3, and 4 have substantially
   321       strong positive correlations with each other.
   322                      All 4 EV proteins in cluster 1 exhibit significantly higher abundance in Group
   323       1 than in Group 2 COVID-19 patients. This is consistent with the idea that cluster 1
   324       might represent a group of antiviral response-related EV proteins. Although the
   325       functions of RHOC or KRAS during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unknown, there are
   326       some reports that implicate PRKCB or COPB2 in antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2.
   327       PRKCB can regulate metabolic and mitochondrial aspects of reprogramming
                                                                      21

   328       responsible for B cell fate               . A recent bioinformatics-based report has revealed that
   329       PRKCB is one of the target genes activated by vitamin A that may have antiviral
   330       potential against SARS-CoV-2 20. COPB2 is a subunit of the Golgi Coatomer complex
   331       (COPI) that is necessary for retrograde trafficking from the Golgi to the endoplasmic
   332       reticulum (ER). Many viruses, including RNA viruses, DNA viruses, and retroviruses,
   333       hijack or adapt COPI-related proteins for their own benefit. Indeed, the gene is required
   334       for replication of SARS-CoV-1, which is closely genetically related (79% identity) to
                                   21
   335       SARS-CoV-2              . Depletion of COPB2 has a strong antiviral effect, based on reduced
   336       SARS-CoV-1 protein expression 22. Although the precise functions of COPB2 positive
   337       EVs still remain unknown, we hypothesize that secretion of these EVs reflects the
   338       development of patient antiviral responses against SARS-CoV-2, potentially mitigating
   339       the severity of COVID-19 progression.
   340                      Cluster 2 includes smoking, age, and MFPA4. MFAP4 is an extracellular

   341       matrix protein belonging to the fibrinogen-related protein superfamily                            . Levels of
   342       MFAP4 are not significantly correlated with either smoking or age. On the other hand,
   343       cluster 3 includes ECM1, CDKN2B.AS1, AL365184.1, CAPN2, CRP, FGG, and
   344       CD147. Based on previous evidence, we considered that ECM1, CDKN2B.AS1,

   353       transmembrane glycoprotein considered to be a binding partner for the SARS-CoV-2
   354       spike protein, with obvious functional implications for viral infection 27. Furthermore,
   355       the role of CD147 in matrix metalloproteinase regulation is important for tumor

   362       have been rapidly increasing in number. Recent reports show that D-dimer elevation at
   363       the time of admission is predictive of bleeding, thrombosis, critical illness, and death in
   364       COVID-19 patients 29. Unfortunately, as our study includes only one COVID-19 patient
   365       with complications from thrombosis, we are unable to make correlations between
   366       D-dimer elevation and predicted disease severity. With regard to the relationship
   367       between cluster 2 and 3, the levels of markers in cluster 3 are correlated with age, which
                                                                                                           30

   369       function of non-coding RNA AL365184.1 is unknown, the bulk of our data suggest that
   370       cluster 2 and 3 represent groups of coagulation-related markers.
   371                       The Cluster 4 components ALT, RNU2-29P, SNORD33, miR-122-5p, and
   372       AL732437.2 may at least partly reflect phenomena related to liver damage. Levels of
   373       ALT, a representative transaminase mainly associated with liver dysfunction, correlate
   374       with levels of the three exRNA species (P<0.05). miRNA-122-5p in particular is a
   375       promising exploratory biomarker for detecting liver injury in preclinical and clinical
                         31

   379       EVs         . Recent data indicate that deranged expression of liver enzymes is one
   380       manifestation of COVID-19 pathology, and that liver injury is more prevalent in severe
                                                                    34,35

   382       RNAs RNU2-29P and AL732437.2 are unknown, our data at least partially support the
   383       idea that exRNAs associated with liver damage can serve as biomarkers for predicting
   384       the severity of COVID-19 in patients at the time of admission.

   386       Discussion
   387                      As a single center study with a small sample size, our work has several
   388       limitations, and caution should be exercised in utilizing the predictive value of the
   389       markers we have identified. An expanded random sample across all genders and ages
   390       should be more representative of the general population, and larger clinical studies are
   391       required to validate the potential of these biomarkers for predicting the severity of
   392       COVID-19 progression. Nevertheless, our research has implications that go beyond the
   393       simple investigation of biomarkers, since the results also provide important clues
   394       regarding the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the development of therapies for the
   395       disease. Indeed, biomarkers such as PRKCB, COPB2, and CD147 may be involved in
                                                                       25

   396       SARS-CoV-2 infection or replication. Furthermore, 6 markers (MFAP4, ECM1,
   397       CDKN2B.AS1, CAPN2, FGG, and CD147) and 2 exRNAs (SNORD33 and
   398       miR-122-5p) are involved in thrombosis or liver injury, which are serious complications
   399       in patients with severe COVID-19. These findings indicate that the profiles of EV
   400       proteins and exRNAs in patient sera clearly reflect specific host reactions to
   401       SARS-CoV-2 infection and progression of the disease. Although the pathological
   402       significance of some markers is unknown, understanding the profiles of functional
   403       extracellular components in patient sera may help clarify various aspects of COVID-19
   404       pathogenesis. With regard to therapy, biomarkers may provide information concerning
   405       potential therapeutic targets for mitigating the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For
   406       instance, our finding that 4 EV proteins in cluster 1 are significantly more abundant in
   407       Group 1 than in Group 2 suggests that these proteins could have antiviral effects.
   408       Supplementation with these EVs could protect patients against COVID-19 progression
   409       and the associated complications. In addition, a recent study showed that antibody
                                                                                                                          27
   410       against the spike protein receptor CD147 could block infection by SARS-CoV-2                                    .
   411       Similarly, neutralization or manipulation of other markers with higher abundance in
                                                                      26

   412       Group 2 than in Group 1 might also have antiviral effects or provide protection against
   413       severe consequences of COVID-19 progression.
   414                      In summary, our comprehensive evaluation identifies 3 distinct groups of
   415       components (antiviral response-related EV proteins, coagulation-related markers, and
   416       liver damage-related exRNAs) capable of serving as early predictive biomarkers for the
   417       severity of COVID-19 progression. Among these markers, EV COPB2 has the best
   418       predictive value for severe deterioration of COVID-19 patients in our cohort.
   419       COVID-19 patients with high levels of EV COPB2 at the time of admission might be
   420       able to overcome the disease without experiencing severe events. It might be
   421       worthwhile to consider whether these markers have greater predictive power than
   422       simpler factors like age and CRP levels. This study for the first time provides potential
   423       resources for early discrimination between COVID-19 patients that may be resistant to
   424       disease progression and patients that are likely to experience severe COVID-19 related
   425       deterioration. Our results also suggest that, in addition to their predictive value,
   426       functional extracellular components can also be potential contributors and mitigators of
   427       pathogenesis during COVID-19 deterioration. These ideas should be validated and
   428       expanded in future studies.

Figure 3. Upper triangular correlation plot of the associations between 4 clinical factors, 9
EV proteins, and 6 transcripts. Colors represent Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficients. Positive
correlations are represented in purple, while negative correlations are represented in brown in the
upper triangle. Color intensity and ovalization of the circle are proportional to the correlation
coefficients. The lower triangular correlation matrix displays actual correlation values, with pink
highlights representing P<0.05. Cluster 1 (PRKCB, RHOC, COPB2, and KRAS) contains a group
of antiviral response-related EV proteins. Clusters 2 (smoking, age, and MFPA4) and 3 (CM1,
CDKN2B.AS1, AL365184.1, CAPN2, CRP, FGG, and CD147) contain groups of coagulation-
related markers. Cluster 4 (ALT, RNU2-29P, SNORD33, miR-122-5p, and AL732437.2) contains
a group of liver damage-related exRNAs.
