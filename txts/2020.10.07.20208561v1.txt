    Abstract 299 words
   Background: Several Intensive Care Units (ICU) have been overwhelmed by the surge of COVID-19
   patients thus necessitating to extend ventilation capacity outside the ICU where air and oxygen
   pressure are not always available. Transport ventilators requiring only O2 source may be used to deliver
   volume-controlled ventilation.
   Objective: To evaluate the performances of four transport ventilators compared to an ICU ventilator
   simulating severe respiratory conditions.
   Materials and methods: Two pneumatic transport ventilators, (Oxylog 3000, Draeger; Osiris 3, Air
   Liquide Medical Systems) and two turbine transport ventilators (Elisee 350, ResMed; Monnal T60, Air
   Liquide Medical Systems) were compared to an ICU ventilator (Engström Carestation – GE Healthcare)
   using a Michigan training test lung. We tested each ventilator with different set volumes Vt s et (350,
   450, 550 ml) and different compliances (20 or 50 ml/cmH 2 O) and a resistance of 15 cmH 2 0/L/sec based
   on values recently described in COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Volume error was
   measured, as well as the trigger time delay during assist-control ventilation simulating spontaneous
   breathing activity with a P0.1 of 4 cmH2 0.
   Results: Grouping all conditions, the volume error was 2.9 ± 2.2 % for Engström Carestation; 3.6 ± 3.9
   % for Osiris 3; 2.5 ± 2.1 % for Oxylog 3000; 5.4 ± 2.7 % for Monnal T60 and 8.8 ± 4.8 % for Elisee 350.
   Grouping all conditions, trigger delay was 42 ± 4 ms, 65 ± 5 ms, 151 ± 14 ms, 51 ± 6 and 64 ± 5 ms for
   Engström Carestation, Osiris 3, Oxylog 3000, Monnal T60 and Elisee 350, respectively.
   Conclusions: In special surge situations such as COVID-19 pandemic, most transport ventilators may
   be used to safely deliver volume-controlled ventilation in locations where only oxygen pressure supply
   is available with acceptable volume accuracy. Performances regarding triggering function are generally
   acceptable but vary across ventilators.

   Introduction
   During the COVID 19 pandemic, some hospitals experienced the greatest shortage of ventilators ever
   seen since the heroic times of the polio epidemic in the 1950s. In this context, different alternative
   solutions including ventilator sharing and use of anesthesia ventilators have been considered to
   manage intubated patients with severe lung failure outside the walls of the ICU [1,2]. For this purpose,
   ventilators must be relatively easy for the users, able to deliver reliable volume-controlled ventilation
   in difficult mechanical conditions adapted to the principles of protective lung ventilation. Importantly,
   they must allow to vary FiO2 without requiring two pressurized sources of gas, (i.e. wall air and oxygen
   at 50 psi). Several transport ventilators are based on pneumatic systems and Venturi systems for gas
   mixing; others use an internal turbine for pressurization; in this case, a low pressure source of oxygen
   is needed for increasing oxygen concentration, but not as a pressure source. They all represent
   interesting solutions in this context and could fulfill the requirements mentioned. Pneumatic transport
   ventilators have been used for decades both for in- and out-of-hospital transport. Their robustness
   and their relative technological simplicity could potentially facilitate massive industrial production. The
   general view on these ventilators is, however, that their limitations make them acceptable for a short
   period like transport but make them incompatible with the safe delivery of difficult ventilation for very
   sick patients over prolonged periods. Undoubtedly, they have limited capacities regarding ventilation
   modes and monitoring, but we questioned whether their performance for delivering lung protective
   ventilation in patients with ARDS merited to be tested again with these objectives in mind. Indeed,
   discarding their use in a context of surge could limit the extension of offering ICU beds possibilities for
   mechanically ventilated patients. The performance and limits of these ventilators have not been
   specifically tested with the appropriate settings and realistic conditions simulating the respiratory
   mechanics of patients with COVID-19 induced ARDS [3-6].

   provided by these different technologies in simulated bench conditions of severe respiratory
   mechanics mimicking patients with COVID-19 induced ARDS.

   Materials and Methods
        1. Ventilators
   Brands
   Four portable ventilators necessitating only one O2 pressurized gas source were included in the study.
   Two pneumatic transport ventilators using Venturi systems to mix air to oxygen were tested: the
   Oxylog 3000 (Draeger, Lubeck, Germany) and the Osiris 3 (Air Liquide Medical Systems, Antony,
   France). Two turbine transport ventilators necessitating additional oxygen only to increase FiO2 were
   also tested: the Elisee 350 (ResMed, San-Diego, USA) and the Monnal T60 (Air Liquide Medical Systems,
   Antony France). The objective was to assess their capability to deliver acceptable ventilation by
   comparing their performances to a standard ICU ventilator: Engström Carestation (GE healthcare,
   Madison, USA). The characteristics of the five ventilators are given in Table 1.
   Working principle and settings
   In the two pneumatic transport ventilators tested (Oxylog 3000 and Osiris 3), the working pressure
   that generates ventilation comes from the high-pressure oxygen supply. These ventilators based on
   “Venturi-distributor” technology work as flow generator.
   With the Oxylog 3000, the air-O2 mixing is regulated from 40% to 100% via a Venturi system coupled
   with a proportional inspiratory valve that also permits to directly set the volume (Vt set). The inspiratory
   flow depends on both the respiratory rate (RR) and the Inspiratory:Expiratory (I:E) ratio. In other
   words, for a given set volume, changing RR and/or I:E ratio keep the set Vt but affects inspiratory flow.
   The monitoring of the expired Vt is available via a specific flow sensor inserted between the
   endotracheal tube and the patient circuit.
   With the Osiris 3, the pneumatic system is based on the Venturi effect to entrain ambient air into the
   ventilator for FiO2 management coupled with a distributor for inspiratory flow setting. Only two

   positions are available for FiO2 : 100% or an FiO2 around 70%. For a given combination of I:E ratio and
   respiratory rate, the Vt is set by directly adjusting a Vt knob that regulates the inspiratory flow. The
   monitoring of the expired Vt is available via a specific flow sensor inserted between the endotracheal
   tube and the patient circuit.
   The Elisee 350 and T60 are two turbine-based ventilators which need oxygen only to adjust FiO2 . On
   those ventilators, the Vt and the inspiratory flow are directly set. Changing the respiratory rate does
   not affect neither Vt nor inspiratory flow.
   The Engström Carestation is a classical high-quality ICU ventilator requiring two sources of pressurized
   gas for oxygen and air (usually wall pressure at 50-55 psi).
   Performances during volume control (VC) ventilation and assist volume control ventilation (ACV) were
   evaluated with different conditions of simulated respiratory mechanics reproducing patients with
   COVID-19 induced ARDS. All experiments have been performed in the Ventilatory Laboratory (Vent-
   Lab) of the Angers Hospital, medical ICU.
        2. Volume delivered and PEEP with different respiratory mechanics
   We assessed the volume effectively delivered (Vte measured) by the ventilators in different conditions of
   respiratory mechanics simulated on a Michigan test lung (Michigan Instruments, Kentwood, MI, USA).
   A linear pneumotachograph (PNT 3700 series, Shawnee, USA) and a pressure transducer (SD160 series:
   Biopac systems, Goleta, CA, USA) were used to measure flow and airway pressure. Signals were
   converted with an analog digital converter (MP150; Biopac systems, Goleta, CA, USA) at a sample rate
   of 200Hz, and stored in a laptop using a dedicated software (Acknowledge, Biopac Systems). Volume
   was obtained from numerical integration of the flow signal.
   Three set volumes (Vt s et) were tested: 350 mL, 450 mL and 550 mL, which approximately cover 6ml/kg
   of Predicted Body Weight (PBW) for most adult patients. The different respiratory mechanics

   conditions tested were: compliance of 50 ml/cmH 2 O and 20 ml/cmH 2 O, both combined with a
   resistance of 15 cmH 2 O/L/s. The combinations of compliance and resistance tested were based on
   recently described COVID-19 respiratory mechanics [3-6].
   Assist Control Ventilation (ACV) mode was selected and similar ventilator settings were applied for
   each ventilator (respiratory rate 30 cycles/min).
   The pneumatic transport ventilators were set with an Inspiratory:Expiratory ratio of 1:3 (I:E) whereas
   a flow of 60L/min was adjusted on the Engström Carestation, Elisee 350 and Monnal T60.
   The three set volumes were tested with FiO2 100% and 70% (air-O2 mix for Osiris 3) as follows: FiO2
   was selected, Vt set was adjusted on the ventilator and Vte measured was recorded and averaged over 5
   cycles after stabilization. FiO2 was measured on Osiris 3 when air-O2 mix was selected with a PF300 gas
   analyzer (IMT Medical, Buchs, Switzerland) in different conditions (Vt = 350 - 450 - 550 mL and
   Compliance = 20 - 50 mL/cmH2 O).
   The performances of Venturi-based ventilation in terms of volume delivery could be altered by set
   inspiratory flow values [7]. To assess the impact of the inspiratory flow, Vte error was calculated on the
   Osiris 3 ventilator. We set a volume of 450 ml using a wide range of inspiratory flows achieved by
   changing respiratory rate (RR). ACV mode with air-O2 mix was selected, a resistance of 15 cmH 2 O/L/s
   and a compliance of 20ml/cmH 2 O were applied and we set a I:E ratio of 1:3. The lowest RR (6
   cycles/min) was chosen and was progressively increased by 4 cycles/min until reaching the maximum
   RR of 40 cycles/min. Vteset had to be adjusted in consequence at each RR increment to keep its value
   at 450 ml. Vteerror was estimated at each step.
   Two levels of PEEP were applied (10 cmH 2 O and 15 cmH 2 O) and the accuracy of the effective PEEP
   (PEEPmeasured) was assessed.

   Volume error and PEEP end-points:
   The relative volume error (Vte error), which is the difference between the effective expired volume
   (Vtemeasured) and the set volume (Vteset) was calculated and averaged as previously described over the
   four different conditions [8,9]:
        ● Resistance = 15 cmH 2 O/L/s, Compliance = 20 or 50 ml/cmH2 O, PEEP = 10 or 15 cmH2 O
   The relative volume error was expressed in percentage and defined as follows:
                                                      |𝑉𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 − 𝑉𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑡 |
                                 𝑉𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 =                                              × 100
                                                                  𝑉𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑡
   End-point for VTerror: The three tidal volumes tested were chosen to cover theoretical “6 ml/kg PBW”
   in adult male or female patients (350, 450 and 550 ml correspond to 6ml/kg PBW for respectively 58,
   75 and 92 kg PBW).
   Ventilation was considered safe and acceptable when Vte measured was within ± 0.5 ml/kg PBW, which
   covers a volume between 5.5 and 6.5 ml/kg PBW. This corresponds to an 8% difference between set
   and measured Vt.
   End-point for PEEP: a difference between measured PEEP and set PEEP was acceptable when less than
   2 cmH2 O.
        3. Synchronization and trigger performances
   Assist control ventilation (ACV) with the inspiratory trigger function “on” was tested by connecting
   ventilators to a double chamber Michigan test lung (Michigan Instruments, Kentwood, MI, USA) to
   simulate spontaneous breathing. One chamber of the test lung was defined as the driving lung while
   the other chamber was connected to the ventilator being tested. A lung -coupling clip allowed a

   connection between the two chambers, so that a positive pressure created in the driving lung induced
   a negative pressure in the experimental lung, leading to trigger the ventilator tested.
   The driving lung was connected to an Evita XL ventilator (Draeger, Lubeck, Germany) and set in volume-
   controlled mode with constant flow. The respiratory rate was set at 25 breaths/ min. The ventilatory
   settings were chosen to achieve a decrease in airway pressure 100 ms after occlusion (P 0;1 ) of 4 cmH20
   (consistent with P0;1 values recently described in COVID patients [10]), measured at the airway opening
   of the lung model [11]. A level of PEEP was applied to the driving lung to obtain a perfect contact of
   the lung-coupling clip between the two chambers at the end of expiration.
   For each ventilator tested, volume assist-control ventilation (ACV) mode was selected, with a tidal
   volume of 450 mL, a respiratory rate of 20 cycles/min and a PEEP of 10 cmH 2 O. I:E ratio was set at 1:3
   for Osiris 3 and Oxylog 3000, while a flow of 60L/min was set on Elisee 350, Monnal T60 and the
   Engström Carestation ICU ventilator. We selected air O 2 -mix for Osiris 3, and FiO2 of 70% on the other
   ventilators. Inspiratory triggers were set at their most responsive position while avoiding auto-
   triggering. The trigger of the Osiris 3 was set at -0.5 cmH2 O. Flow-triggered ventilators were set at 1
   L/min for Engström Carestation and Oxylog 3000 and 2 L/min for Monnal T60 and Elisee 350.
   For each configuration, trigger performance was assessed by measuring airway pressure changes using
   the flow trace to determine the start of inspiration [9,12]. Negative pressure drop (∆P, cmH2 0),
   Triggering Delay (TD, ms) and Pressurization Delay (PD, ms) as defined on figure 1 were computed. The
   overall Inspiratory Delay (ID) corresponds to the addition of TD and PD.
   End-point: triggering function was considered as “safe and acceptable” when TD was less than 100 ms.
        4. Statistical analysis
   Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± SD values averaged from 5 consecutive breaths. These
   variables were compared using an ANOVA test. The type I significance level was set at 0.05. When the

   correction, which sets the level of significance for pairwise differences between the five ventilators at
   0.005.

   Results
        1. Volume delivered and PEEP measured with different respiratory mechanics
   Results are displayed in figure 2 and mean volume errors (Vteerror) for each ventilator are shown in
   Table 2. When all conditions and set volumes were included, the Engström Carestation was the most
   precise ventilator, and the Oxylog 3000 was comparable. Each ventilator performance was considered
   as acceptable (delta Vt ± 0.5ml/kg PBW) except for one turbine ventilator (Elisee 350). The impact of
   FiO2 selection (FiO2 100% or 70%) on volume error was significant considering all ventilators (p < 0.05),
   reaching a maximum of 11.9 % for Elisee 350 with FiO2 100% (changes for each ventilator are available
   on table 2). The impact of compliance on volume error was not significant considering all ventilators
   (p > 0.05) and changes for each ventilator are available on table 2. FiO2 measured on Osiris 3 reached
   72.3 ± 1.7% regarding all the conditions tested.
   When all conditions were put together, differences between measured PEEP and set PEEP were less
   than 2 cmH2 O as shown on table 2.
        2. Impact of inspiratory flow on pneumatic ventilators
   The effect of inspiratory flow rates on Vte error for Osiris 3 is shown on figure 3. The lowest values of
   inspiratory flow are associated with a Vte error above 8% (delta Vt ± 0.5ml/kg PBW). Performances are
   acceptable when inspiratory flow (resulting from the combination of Vt, I:E ratio and respiratory rate)
   was strictly above 30 L/min, which corresponds to a respiratory rate higher than 20 cycles/min.
        3. Synchronization and trigger performances during ACV
   Inspiratory trigger was evaluated for each ventilator and results are displayed on figure 4. All simulated
   efforts triggered a ventilatory cycle. The Triggering Delay was 42 ± 4 ms, 65 ± 5 ms, 151 ± 14 ms, 51 ±
   6 ms and 64 ± 5 ms for Engström Carestation, Osiris 3, Oxylog 3000, Monnal T60 and Elisee 350,

   respectively (all conditions grouped). Each ventilator performance was considered as acceptable (TD <
   100ms) except for one pneumatic ventilator (Oxylog 3000).
   The Inspiratory Delay (ID) was measured at 54 ± 5 ms for Engström Carestation, 95 ± 5 ms for Osiris 3,
   217 ± 21 ms for Oxylog 3000, 72 ± 6 ms for Monnal T60 and 85 ± 7 ms for Elisee 350 and (p < 0.05;
   pairwise differences between ventilators were all significant with a p-value < 0.005). A similar trend
   was observed for triggering delay.
   The airway pressure drop was much larger for Oxylog 3000 (- 4.1 ± 0.3 cmH2 O), than for the others:-
   0.9 ± 0.3 cmH2 O for Engström Carestation, - 1.9 ± 0.1 cmH2 0 for Osiris 3, , - 0.6 ± 0.1 cmH2 O for Monnal
   T60 and - 0.9 ± 0.1 for Elisee 350 (p < 0.05; pairwise differences between ventilators were all significant
   with a p-value < 0.005 , except between Osiris 3 and Elisee 350).

   Discussion
   The results of the present bench test study comparing turbine and pneumatic transport ventilators to
   an ICU ventilator, can be summarized as follows: 1. Turbine ventilators show performance in VC and
   ACV very close to the ICU ventilator tested for most of the settings. 2. In severe respiratory mechanics
   conditions, the volume error exceeds 0.5 ml/kg PBW only for one turbine ventilator. 3. Inspiratory
   trigger reactivity is less than 100 ms except for one pneumatic transport ventilator. 4. Volume error
   delivered by the simplest pneumatic ventilator significantly increases when inspiratory flow is less than
   30 L/min indicating a technological limit of the Venturi system.
   The increasing number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the context of the COVID -19
   worldwide crisis, and the ventilators shortage reported in some severely affected countries, has led to
   discuss the possibilities to manage intubated patients outside the walls of the ICU [2]. According to this
   dire scenario, simple and easy to set ventilators that only require one oxygen pressure source to
   function and able to deliver lung protective ventilation could be considered. In addition, an assisted
   volume mode that ensures the set Vt with PEEP up to 15 cmH 2 O and FiO2 up to 100% is required to
   manage high elastic load and severe shunt that characterize potentially severe COVID -19 ARDS [1,2].
   Recent turbine transport and emergency ventilators have performances which are very close to
   conventional ICU ventilators [13,14]. In the context of “mass casualty”, as experienced with the COVID-
   19 crisis, pneumatic transport ventilators could be used to extend the possibility to manage intubated
   patients in case of ICU beds shortage. The working principle of these pneumatic ventilators is based on
   a “Venturi system” which is a simple technological solution that permits to manage ventilation
   generated by the oxygen pressurized source when a position called air-O2 mix is selected. Interestingly,
   the simplicity of such pneumatic systems permits to consider massive industrialization faster and at a
   lower cost. On the opposite, the Venturi system explains the limits observed with low inspiratory flow
   previously described with this technology [7].

   Performances during controlled ventilation:
   In case of high impedance, a low inspiratory flow may increase significantly volume error when the O 2
   air mix position is selected “on”. In turn, manipulating I:E ratio, respiratory rate and increasing
   inspiratory flow above 30 L/min permits to reverse the Vt error that is directly explained by the working
   principle of this ventilator (see figure 3). The technological adaptations available on Oxylog 3000
   (Venturi coupled with proportional inspiratory valve) solve this problem while expired Vt monitoring
   available on Osiris 3 simplifies settings adaptation if required. Previous bench test studies have
   reported a Vt error with pneumatic basic transport ventilators that reached 20% of set Vt with resistive
   load [7,15]. These experiments were performed with very low set inspiratory flow thus explaining the
   Vt reduction observed. For this purpose, an essential recommendation is to set the I:E ratio at 1:3
   (minimal available value), and set the RR above 20 /min before adjusting the knob (that controls the
   inspiratory flow) to reach the set Vt as indicated on the ventilator. With these recommendations,
   volume error measured on pneumatic transport ventilators at low compliance are closed from turbine
   performances and acceptable since it did not exceed 0.5 ml/kg PBW.
   Of note, only the ICU and turbine ventilators tested compensate for the loss in Vt due to the
   compression of gas inside the circuit. Nevertheless, this effect previously quantified in ICU ventilators
   with inspiratory-expiratory circuits is significantly less in basic transport ventilators since they are
   equipped with a single limb circuit [8]. Of note, an HEPA filter can be easily adjusted on the expiratory
   limb and they should not expose to higher risks of viral contamination.
   Performances during assisted ventilation:
   Recent experience with COVID-19 induced ARDS reports that these patients often exhibit high
   respiratory drive and asynchrony that may require deep sedation and sometimes paralysis [4]. We
   therefore evaluated the behavior of these two pneumatic transport ventilators during triggered
   breaths since performances of their trigger have been questioned [14,15]. The synchronization was
   overall respected except for the Oxylog 3000 exhibiting the poorest triggering performances. The

   triggering time delay was consistently longer in pneumatic ventilators but acceptable except on the
   Oxylog 3000, compared to the ICU ventilator [14].
   Limitations
   The results obtained in vitro necessitate some caution to be translated to the clinical practice, but
   previous studies showed that this type of simulation predicts the results observed in clinical situations
   with a high fidelity [8,16,17]. The lung model gives the unique opportunity to compare ventilator
   performances according to several simulated but standardized clinical conditions. Bench experiment
   also permits to accurately depict and understand advantages and limits of the different ventilator’s
   technologies as previously done [7]. Our experiment reported performances of only two pneumatic
   and two turbine ventilators while several other ventilators with similar technology are available
   worldwide. We did not evaluate pressure support ventilation while this approach can be useful to
   manage weaning of COVID-19 patients. Previous studies already showed that turbine-based ventilator
   significantly outperform pneumatic transport ventilators during pressure mode ventilation [13,14].
   Conclusion
   The present bench study suggests that turbine technologies may replace ICU ventilators to extend ICU
   beds where only oxygen pressure supply is available, in special surge situations such as COVID -19 crisis.
   Pneumatic transport ventilators provide acceptable volume accuracy even in severe simulated
   conditions. For this purpose, attention is required to maintain sufficient inspiratory flow in the Osiris 3
   (or any other pneumatic ventilator using a venturi system). A monitoring of expired Vt available on the
   two pneumatic transport ventilators tested greatly facilitates settings. Performances regarding
   triggering function are non-acceptable in one of the pneumatic transport ventilator thus rendering
   hazardous its use in assist control ventilation.

The figure illustrates ventilator triggering assessment. Airway pressure (Paw) and flow are displayed. Triggering delay (TD) is the delay between the
onset of airway pressure drop (“patient” effort) and flow delivery by the ventilator. Pressurization delay (PD) is defined by the time at which the
airway pressure comes back to the level of PEEP. The addition of TD and PD gives the inspiratory delay (ID). The drop of airway pressure (∆P) due to
patient effort is also shown on the figure.

Panel A. The histogram represents the mean expired volumes measured for each ventilator according to the three Vt set in 100% FiO2. The average was
computed over the four conditions of resistance (15 cmH2O/L/sec), compliance (20 - 50 ml/cmH2O) and PEEP (10 - 15 cmH2O). The three tidal volumes
tested were chosen to cover 6 ml/kg PBW, with 350, 450 and 550 ml corresponding to 6ml/kg PBW for respectively 58, 75 and 92 kg PBW. Limits of
acceptable ventilation are displayed with dotted lines and defined as a volume change within ± 0.5 ml/kg PBW, which corresponds to a Vt between 5.5
and 6.5 ml/kg PBW.
Panel B. The histogram represents the mean expired volumes measured for each ventilator according to the three Vt set in 70% FiO2. The average was
computed over the four conditions of resistance (15 cmH2O/L/sec), compliance (20 - 50 ml/cmH2O) and PEEP (10 - 15 cmH2O) .

Figure 3.
This figure shows the volume error of the Osiris 3 expressed in % of Vt set according to different inspiratory flows obtained at a constant 450 ml Vt set.
Compliance, resistance and PEEP were set at 20 ml/cmH2O, 15 cmH2O/L/sec and 10 cmH2O respectively. Black circles were obtained with 100% FiO2
while the white circles were obtained with 70% FiO2. Respiratory rate associated with each point is also displayed. This figure illustrates that for an
inspiratory flow below 30 L/min, the Vt error is substantial with 70% FiO2. The Vt error is within ± 0.5 ml/kg PBW (which corresponds to an 8%
difference between set and measured Vt) whatever the inspiratory flow when 100% FiO2 is selected.

The figure illustrates the triggering efficiency for each ventilator tested during assist-control ventilation using the Michigan test lung to simulate
spontaneous breathing. A PEEP of 10 cmH2O, a compliance of 20 and 50 ml/cmH2O and a resistance of 15 cmH2O/L/sec were selected. Triggering Delay
(TD, ms) and Pressurization Delay (PD, ms) were computed. A definition of TD and PD is available on figure 1. Triggering function was considered safe
and acceptable when TD was less than 100 ms.
