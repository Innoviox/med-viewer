Abstract
Importance: Few studies have measured the effect of genetic factors on dementia and cognitive
decline in a population of healthy older individuals followed prospectively.
Objective: To examine the effect of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes and a polygenic risk score
(PRS) on incident dementia and cognitive decline in a longitudinal cohort of healthy older people.
Design, Setting and Participants: Post-hoc genetic analysis of a randomized clinical trial population
- the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial. At enrollment, participants had no
history of diagnosed dementia, atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease, or permanent physical
disability and were without cognitive impairment.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Dementia (adjudicated trial endpoint) and cognitive decline,
defined as a >1.5 standard deviation decline in test score for either global cognition, episodic memory,
language/executive function or psychomotor speed, versus baseline scores. Cumulative incidence
curves for all-cause dementia and cognitive decline were calculated with mortality as a competing
event, stratified by APOE genotypes and tertiles of a PRS based on 23 common non-APOE variants.
Results: 12,978 participants with European ancestry were included; 54.8% were female, and average
age at baseline was 75 years (range 70 to 96). During a median 4.5 years of follow-up, 324 (2.5%)
participants developed dementia and 503 (3.8%) died. Cumulative incidence of dementia to age 85
years was estimated to be 7.4% in all participants, 12.6% in APOE ε4 heterozygotes, 26.6% in ε4
homozygotes, 9.6% in the high PRS tertile, and 7.3% in the low PRS tertile. APOE ε4
heterozygosity/homozygosity was associated with a 2.5/6.3-fold increased risk of dementia and a
1.4/1.8-fold increased risk of cognitive decline, versus ε3/ε3 (P<0.001 for both). A high PRS (top
tertile) was associated with a 1.4-fold increase risk of dementia, versus the low tertile (CI 1.04-1.76,
P=0.02), but was not associated with cognitive decline risk (CI 0.96-1.22, P = 0.18).
Conclusions and Relevance: Incidence of dementia among healthy older individuals is low across
all genotypes; however, APOE ε4 and high PRS increase relative risk. APOE ε4 is associated with
cognitive decline, but PRS is not.

KEY POINTS



Question: How do genetic factors influence the risk of dementia and cognitive decline among healthy

older individuals?



Findings: We studied cumulative incidence of dementia and cognitive decline in 12,978 healthy older

individuals without cardiovascular disease or cognitive impairment at enrollment, stratified by APOE

genotype and a polygenic risk score (PRS). APOE ε4 and PRS increased the relative risk of dementia,

but cumulative incidence was low across all genotypes. APOE genotypes were associated with

cognitive decline, but PRS was not.



Meaning: Incidence of dementia is low among healthy older individuals; however, genetic factors

still increase relative risk.

 1   INTRODUCTION

 2   Few studies have measured the effect of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes and polygenic risk

 3   scores (PRS) on incident dementia and cognitive decline in healthy older people. The ASPREE

 4   (ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) cohort offers the opportunity to measure these effects,

 5   as recruited participants had no history of cardiovascular disease, dementia or significant physical

 6   disability at enrollment. The ASPREE study was a randomised, placebo-controlled trial to determine

 7   whether daily low dose aspirin increased survival, free of dementia or persistent physical disability,

 8   in 19,114 healthy community-dwelling older people(1). In 2018, ASPREE reported that over an

 9   average 4.5 year follow-up, aspirin did not prolong disability-free survival(2-4) or reduce the risk of

10   dementia or cognitive decline(5).


11   The APOE gene is the strongest genetic determinant of all-cause dementia, especially Alzheimer’s

12   disease (AD), with the ε4 allele elevating risk and accelerating age of onset(6-9). The ε4 allele is also

13   associated with cognitive impairment (dysfunction in episodic memory, processing speed, executive

14   function or global cognition) in people without a dementia diagnosis(10-13). Beyond APOE, common

15   disease-associated variants identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS)(14-18) also

16   modify dementia risk, and can be used to calculate a polygenic risk score (PRS)(9, 19-24).

17   Individually, these common genetic variants have low effect sizes, yet when combined into a PRS

18   can enable risk-stratification for dementia indications beyond APOE genotype. There is varying

19   evidence for whether a PRS for dementia can also predict cognitive decline(25-28). Incorporating

20   both APOE genotypes and PRS, alongside conventional risk factors, may enable more accurate risk

21   prediction(29, 30). This may aid development of therapeutic strategies or prevention, and advance

22   our understanding of the genetic differences between (diagnosed) dementia, and cognitive decline.


23   The predictive performance of PRSs for dementia requires further investigation in well-characterised

24   prospective studies. Predictive performance can be influenced by factors such as ethnicity, age, study


                                                                      5

25   recruitment criteria, clinical diagnostic criteria, neuropsychological assessments used, genotyping

26   platform, and genetic variants included(6-9, 19-24, 29-31). More studies of cognitively healthy

27   elderly individuals followed prospectively are required to assess variability and predictive accuracy.

28   Here, we report the effects of APOE and PRS on incident dementia and cognitive decline among

29   12,978 ASPREE participants, where dementia was an exclusionary criterion at entry and adjudicated

30   as a primary trial endpoint.

32   METHODS


33   Study population

34   Consistent with the ASPREE inclusion criteria(1), participants had no previous history or current

35   diagnosis of atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease, dementia, loss of independence with basic

36   activities of daily living, or life-threatening illness. Participants passed a global cognition screen at

37   enrollment (>77 on the Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) Examination). Informed consent for

38   genetic analysis was obtained, with ethical approval from the Alfred Hospital Human Research Ethics

39   Committee (390/15) and site-specific Institutional Review Boards (US).


40   Incident Dementia Diagnosis

41   After standardized cognition and functional measures, participants reporting memory or cognitive

42   problems were assessed by specialists or prescribed dementia medication (Australia). Following

43   identification of dementia triggers (3MS<78 or a drop of >10.15 points from the participant’s baseline

44   3MS score, accounting for age and education), additional assessments were conducted, with brain

45   imaging and laboratory analyses collected for adjudication. Each dementia trigger case was reviewed

46   according to the ASPREE protocol for clinical adjudication(4, 5) by an adjudication committee

47   consisting of geriatricians, neurologists and neuropsychologists. Dementia was diagnosed using

48   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria. Diagnosis date was

49   recorded as date of trigger.


50   Cognitive Decline

51   The ASPREE cognitive battery included the 3MS for general cognition, the Hopkins Verbal Learning

52   Test-Revised (HVLT-R) for episodic memory, the single letter Controlled Oral World Association

53   Test (COWAT) for language and executive function, and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)

54   to measure psychomotor speed. Accredited professionals administered assessments at baseline and

                                                                      7

     preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in
                                                                    perpetuity.

55   year 1, followed biennially during follow-up. As reported previously(5), cognitive decline in

56   participants without a dementia diagnosis was defined as a 1.5 standard deviation decline in

57   3MS/HVLT-R/SDMT/COWAT compared with baseline scores, sustained over ≥2 timepoints.


58   Genotyping and variant analysis

59   14,052 samples were genotyped using the Axiom 2.0 Precision Medicine Diversity Research Array

60   following standard protocols. 12,978 samples passed quality control (12,343 Australian, 635 US)

61   based on sex, relatedness and ancestry (Non-Finnish Europeans). To estimate population structure,

62   we performed principal component analysis using the 1000 Genomes reference population (Figure

63   S1)(32, 33). Imputation was performed using the haplotype reference consortium European

64   panel(34). Post-imputation quality control removed variants r2<0.3. APOE genotype was measured

65   using two directly genotyped variants (rs7412, rs429358) extracted using plink v1.9(35).


66   Polygenic risk score

67   PRS was calculated using 23 common variants (15 genotyped, 8 imputed) associated with AD at

68   genome-wide significance, that affect risk independently of APOE(17, 24, 36). PRS calculations,

69   using plink v1.9(35), were based on dosage (0,1,2) of SNP effect allele reported from GWAS,

70   multiplied by effect sizes, followed by the sum of products to generate a PRS per participant (Table

71   S1). PRS distribution was divided into low/middle/high tertiles; with mean values of; low -0.56 (range

72   -1.43 to -0.34), middle -0.20 (-0.34 to -0.06), high 0.16 (-0.06 to 1.86)(Figure S2).


73   Statistical analysis

74   To determine whether APOE genotype frequencies were under selective pressure due to age and/or

75   trial inclusion/exclusion criteria, we performed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) testing. This

76   compared observed genotype frequencies with those expected in a population under no selective

77   pressure, using chi-squared tests. We examined the cumulative incidence of dementia (CID) and

                                                                      8

78   cognitive decline, stratified by APOE genotype and PRS tertiles. We used ε3 homozygotes as a

79   reference group for APOE-stratified analysis, and the low-risk tertile for PRS-stratified analysis.

80   Consistent with other studies(9, 24) we combined APOE ε3/ε4:ε2/ε4 into a single group, and

81   ε2/ε2:ε2/ε3 into a single group.

82   We estimated cumulative incidence of all-cause dementia and cognitive decline during an average of

83   4.5 years of follow-up, using the Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF) of the etm package(37, 38) in

84   R version 3.6.0(39). Data were censored by date of dementia diagnosis, cognitive decline, last contact

85   or death. The age on censored date was used as a time scale in CIF model. Cumulative incidence was

86   calculated up to 95 years, then stratified by APOE genotype and PRS tertiles. Dementia and cognitive

87   decline between PRS tertiles was compared for the whole cohort and further stratified by APOE

88   genotypes. The dementia and cognitive decline models were estimated independently.

89   We used the Fine and Gray (F&G) method of accounting for competing risk of death, and Cox

90   proportional hazard regression model to calculate dementia hazard ratio of both models, for APOE,

91   PRS and their interaction, adjusted for age at enrollment (continuous, allowing a quadratic function)

92   and sex(9, 37). We used age on censored date as a time scale in both F&G and Cox models. Hazard

93   ratios for cognitive decline were measured the same way. To test association of APOE genotypes and

94   PRS with cohort characteristics, we used a multivariable regression model with variables; age, sex,

95   follow-up time, education, alcohol use, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression (Center

96   for     Epidemiological            Studies-Depression-10               scale),       family        history       of      dementia

97   (father/mother/sibling), body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides. Bonferroni

98   multiple test correction at P=0.002 significance was applied (0.05/17=0.002).

 99   RESULTS

100   Characteristics of the 12,978 genotyped participants are shown in Table 1. Overall, 54.8% were

101   female, 47% had educational attainment <12 years, 3% were current smokers, and 25% reported a

102   family history of dementia at enrollment.

103   Associations of cohort characteristics with APOE genotypes and PRS tertiles are also shown in Table

104   1. The only associations to survive multiple testing correction was family history of dementia in ε4

105   heterozygotes/homozygotes, with no cohort characteristics differing between PRS tertiles (Table 1).

106   We found that APOE genotype frequencies had deviated from HWE (chi-square=38,

107   P=<0.001)(Table S2), with fewer ε3/ε4 heterozygotes (N=2665 observed, N=2723 expected) and

108   fewer ε4/ε4 homozygotes (N=200 observed, N=239 expected) than expected under HWE.

109   During mean 4.5 years of follow-up (interquartile range 2.1 to 5.7 years, 2779 person-years), we

110   observed 324 (2.5%) incident all-cause dementia cases and 503 (3.8%) deaths (Table 2). For

111   cumulative incidence of dementia (CID), we describe results up to age 85 years, representing an

112   approximate centre point between lower and upper age ranges of the ASPREE population at baseline

113   (70 to 96 years). CID in ASPREE was estimated at 7.4% (CI 6.5 to 8.5).

114   In APOE genotype-stratified analysis of CID, after adjusting for covariates and death as a competing

115   event, ε4/ε4 genotype was significantly associated with dementia risk (HR 6.38 [CI 3.8-10.7]

116   P=2.0x10-12) compared with ε3/ε3 (Table 3a). Individuals with ε3/ε4 heterozygosity were also at

117   higher risk of dementia (HR 2.51 [CI 1.9-3.1], P=1.5x10-14) compared with ε3/ε3. CID was 26.6%

118   (CI 16.2-42.0) for ε4/ε4 homozygotes, 12.6% (CI 10.2-15.5) for ε3/ε4 heterozygotes, 5.9% (CI 4.8-

119   7.2) for the common ε3/ε3 genotype group, and 4.0% (CI 2.4-6.5) for the lower-risk ε2/ε2:ε2/ε3 group

120   (Figure 1a). For all APOE genotype-stratified results see Table S3.

121   Dementia risk was higher for participants in the high-risk PRS tertile than the low (HR 1.36 [CI 1.0-

122   1.7], P=0.02)(Table 3a). CID in the high-risk tertile was 9.6% (CI 7.8-11.8) compared with the low
                                                                      10

123   tertile 7.3% (CI 5.7-9.3)(Figure 1b; Table S4). At age 95 years, the effect of PRS was more prominent

124   with CID increasing from 17.6% (13.4-23.0) in the low PRS tertile to 30.6% (21.9-41.9) in the high

125   (Table S4).

126   In sub-group analysis, among APOE ε3/ε4 heterozygotes, PRS modified dementia risk, with CID

127   increasing from 10.8% (CI 7.2-16.3) in the low PRS tertile to 17.8% (CI 13.2-23.8) in the high (Table

128   S5). Among APOE ε4/ε4 homozygotes with high PRS (the highest genetic risk category), CID was

129   32.2% (CI 11.3-71.6). In ε4/ε4 homozygotes with low PRS, CID was lower at 24.6% (CI 11.2-48.8).

130   For ε3/ε3 homozygotes, CID in the low-risk PRS tertile was 5.7% (CI 3.9-8.3) and in the high-risk

131   7.6% (CI 5.5-10.5)(Table S5).

132   We compared CID between the highest genetic risk group at age 80 (ε4 carriers with high PRS) and

133   the lowest genetic risk group at age 90 (ε2 carriers with low PRS). CID in the highest genetic risk

134   group at age 80 was 6.1% (CI 4.1-9.0) and in the lowest genetic risk at age 90 was 8.8% (CI 4.5-16.7)

135   (Table S5). This corresponded to an approximately 10-year delay in age-of-onset between these two

136   extreme groups. In sensitivity analysis, we examined interaction between APOE/PRS, and found no

137   significant association with incident dementia (P>0.05).

138   A total of 1598 (12.6%) participants had cognitive decline (Table 1). The cumulative incidence of

139   cognitive decline to age 85 years was estimated to be 37.2% (CI 36.4-41.0) in APOE ε3/ε3

140   homozygotes, 35.3% (CI 30.5-39.6) in ε2/ε2 homozygotes, 45.7% (CI 46.5-53.9) in ε3/ε4

141   heterozygotes, and 52.9% (CI 46.1-76.2) in ε4/ε4 homozygotes (Figure 2a, Table S6). Compared with

142   the ε3/ε3 reference group, cognitive decline risk was significantly higher in ε3/ε4 heterozygotes

143   (HR=1.35 [1.20-1.51], P<0.001) and ε4 homozygotes (HR=1.75 [CI 1.24-2.46]), P<0.001)(Table 3b).

144   PRS was not associated with cognitive decline. Risk of cognitive decline did not significantly increase

145   between low and high PRS tertiles (HR=1.08 [0.96-1.22], P=0.18)(Figure 2b, Table S7-S8). In

148   DISCUSSION

149   In this study, we examined the effect of APOE genotypes and PRS on incident dementia and cognitive

150   decline among 12,978 initially healthy older participants. We found that APOE ε4 and high PRS were

151   associated with increased relative risk of dementia, but overall, cumulative incidence of dementia was

152   low across all genotype groups. PRS effect on dementia risk was modest and delayed compared with

153   APOE ε4, mostly affecting risk after 85 years of age. APOE ε4 was associated with cognitive decline,

154   but PRS was not, suggesting that APOE genotype has a stronger effect than PRS on both dementia

155   and cognitive decline. We observe that the absence of co-morbidities, atherothrombotic

156   cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment to age 70 years contributed to the attenuation of

157   incident dementia across all genotypes.

158   The unique ascertainment of the ASPREE population is an important factor in the interpretation of

159   our results. The eligibility criteria excluded individuals with dementia diagnoses and cognitive

160   impairment at enrollment, and individuals with any history or diagnosis of atherothrombotic

161   cardiovascular disease events, major physical disability or life-threatening cancer(1). This produced

162   a highly selected population of healthy older individuals, who at the time of study entry, benefited

163   from the absence of several important dementia risk factors. This selective pressure resulted in

164   deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, with fewer deleterious APOE ε4 alleles observed

165   than expected. Selection against ε4 was driven by the age cut-off (>70 years), as well as the strict

166   inclusion/exclusion criteria of the trial.

167   We accordingly observed a low cumulative incidence of all-cause dementia, estimated to be 7.4% to

168   age 85 across all participants. This estimate was approximately half that reported in the community-

169   based Rotterdam study to the same age (15.6%)(9). While acknowledging potential issues with

170   comparing dementia risk between different studies, including differences in population demography,

171   recruitment criteria, diagnostic definitions, and duration of follow-up(7, 9, 24), we consider


                                                                      13

172   comparisons between ASPREE and the Rotterdam study warranted. The studies had similar sample

173   sizes, age ranges, sex percentages, diabetes, hypertension, BMI, blood lipids, genetic ancestry and

174   adjudicated dementia cases. Further, both analyses used the same PRS calculations(17, 24, 36).

175   The lower risk of dementia in ASPREE is likely influenced by the selection of healthy participants,

176   depletion of deleterious APOE ε4 alleles, and a relatively short follow-up period where healthy

177   selection effects have not yet dissipated. The estimated CID in ASPREE was 26.6% for ε4/ε4

178   homozygotes, compared with approximately 60% in the Rotterdam study, and 5.9% for ε3/ε4

179   heterozygotes, compared with approximately 25% in the Rotterdam study(9). These differences in

180   CID are substantial, unlikely to be attributable to confounding factors alone between the studies.

181   Further, in a recent meta-analysis of three population-based cohorts of cognitively normal subjects

182   aged 60-75 years (total N=11,771), the risk of dementia in APOE ε4/ε4 homozygotes (N=134) to age

183   70-75 years was 11.2%(7). In ASPREE, however, the risk of dementia to age 75 in ε4/ε4 (N=200)

184   was only 3.7%. Risk of dementia among ε4/ε4 homozygotes to age 85 years in the Framingham Heart

185   Study (37.6%, N=67) was also considerably higher than ASPREE (26.6% N=200)(7).

186   PRS is more challenging to interpret across studies, given the different PRSs used(7, 9, 21-24).

187   However, we also observed an attenuated effect of PRS on dementia in ASPREE compared with other

188   studies. We observed only a 2.6% difference in CID between low (7.3%) and high (9.6%) PRS

189   tertiles. In the Rotterdam study, the observed difference was 9.0% between low (11.6%) and high

190   (20.4%) tertiles to the same age.

191   In ASPREE, the effect of PRS was more pronounced in APOE ε4 carriers, compared with the

192   reference ε3/ε3 group. However, the PRS effect was attenuated and delayed in age-of-onset compared

193   with other studies(9, 40). The PRS effect on dementia risk in ASPREE mostly occurred after the age

194   of 85 years (Figure 2a). We found no significant interaction effect between APOE and PRS in

195   ASPREE, unlike the Rotterdam study(9). This again may reflect the attenuation of genetic effects on

                                                                      14

196   dementia risk in ASPREE. A recent analysis of the Framingham cohort also reported no significant

197   interaction between APOE and PRS while evaluating dementia risk(40). Further studies with large

198   populations and longer follow-up are required to understand interactions between APOE and PRS in

199   modifying dementia risk.

200   Considering the attenuated genetic risk of dementia observed in ASPREE, we query whether other

201   factors further modified risk, beyond the low vascular risk, cognitive screening and absence of

202   cardiovascular disease at baseline. Such factors could include a favourable lifestyle, characterized by

203   healthy diet, regular exercise and high socialisation levels(29, 30). Alternatively, the attenuation

204   could be related to the relatively short follow-up period, during which healthy selection effects had

205   not yet dissipated.

206   Protective genetic loci not included in the PRS may also have contributed to risk modification,

207   including common variants yet to be identified by GWAS, and/or rare high-effect protective variants,

208   including loss-of-function variants in biologically associated genes. There is growing evidence that

209   protection from dementia risk can be conferred by both common and rare genetic variants, especially

210   in the high-risk APOE ε4/ε4 group(41, 42). Further studies are required to examine the effect of

211   protective genetic variants for dementia in ASPREE.

212   APOE ε4 carrier status was significantly associated with cognitive decline in ASPREE, but PRS was

213   not. This reflects the more modest effect of PRS on cognitive aging, and/or a divergent genetic

214   aetiology versus APOE genotype(26). The association between APOE ε4 and cognitive decline in

215   non-demented individuals has been reported by several studies using comparable cognitive

216   testing(10-13, 28). However, few studies have reported a significant effect of PRS on cognitive

217   decline alone(25-28). It appears that PRS derived from GWAS of diagnosed dementia/AD cases are

218   not strong predictors of cognitive decline without dementia during aging. However, our approach to

219   quantifying cognitive decline may be insensitive, or might reflect a different biological process.


                                                                      15

220   Alternatively, PRS derived from a GWAS of dementia/AD cases may reflect the functional

221   impairment required for dementia diagnosis, rather than the cognitive aspects.

222   Strengths of the study include a well-characterized longitudinal cohort with repeated cognitive

223   assessments and dementia adjudication, genetic data for both APOE and PRS variants, longitudinal

224   follow-up to enable survival analysis for dementia and cognition, data available on covariates,

225   adjudicated reports of causes of death to control for competing events, and a large number of initially

226   healthy elderly participants.

227   Limitations of the study include a shorter duration of follow-up compared with other studies(7, 9)

228   (possibly insufficient to overcome a healthy volunteer effect) and limited event numbers in some rarer

229   APOE genotype groups. Dementia events were not stratified into AD versus other dementia types.

230   However, very few dementia cases were classified as non-AD in ASPREE (1.2%), with the majority

231   of dementia classified as probable/possible-AD(5).

232   In conclusion, our study found that APOE genotypes and PRS effect the relative risk of dementia in

233   a population of healthy older individuals followed prospectively. However, overall CID in the

234   population was low across all genotype groups, reflecting the healthy nature of the population at

235   enrollment. APOE ε4 had a stronger effect than PRS on dementia risk. APOE genotypes affected

236   cognitive decline, whereas PRS did not. Prospective studies of initially healthy older participants with

237   longer follow-up periods are required to further understand the genetic risk of dementia and cognitive

238   decline during aging, and examine the predictive performance and clinical utility of PRS.
