 Abstract
    Objective: Markup of generalized interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) on EEG is an important
 step in the diagnosis and characterization of epilepsy. However, manual EEG markup is a time-
 consuming, subjective, and highly specialized task where the human reviewer needs to visually
 inspect a large amount of data to facilitate accurate clinical decisions. The objective of this study was
 to develop a framework for automated detection of generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA),
 which is a characteristic type of generalized IED seen in scalp EEG recordings of patients with
 Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a severe form of drug-resistant generalized epilepsy.
    Methods: We studied 13 children with LGS who had GPFA events in their interictal EEG
 recordings. Time-frequency information derived from manually marked IEDs across multiple EEG
 channels was used to automatically detect similar events in each patient’s interictal EEG. We
 validated true positives and false positives of the proposed spike detection approach using both
 standalone scalp EEG and simultaneous EEG-functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) recordings.
    Results: GPFA events displayed a consistent low-high frequency arrangement in the time-
 frequency domain. This ‘bimodal’ spectral feature was most prominent over frontal EEG channels.
 Our automatic detection approach using this feature identified likely epileptic events with similar
 time-frequency properties to the manually marked GPFAs. Brain maps of EEG-fMRI signal change
 during these automatically detected IEDs were comparable to the EEG-fMRI brain maps derived
 from manual IED markup.
    Conclusion: GPFA events have a characteristic bimodal time-frequency feature that can be
 automatically detected from scalp EEG recordings in patients with LGS. Validity of this time-
 frequency feature is demonstrated by EEG-fMRI analysis of automatically detected events, which
 recapitulates the brain maps we have previously shown to underlie generalized IEDs in LGS.
    Significance: This study provides a novel methodology that paves the way for quick, automated,
 and objective inspection of generalized IEDs in LGS. The proposed framework may be extendable to
 a wider range of epilepsy syndromes in which monitoring the burden of epileptic activity can aid
 clinical decision-making. For example, automated quantification of generalized discharges may
 permit faster assessment of treatment response and estimation of future seizure risk.

1     Introduction
    Generalized interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are a characteristic feature of the interictal
(i.e., ‘between seizures’) scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) in multiple forms of epilepsy.
Generalized IEDs are typically seen across bilaterally distributed scalp electrodes and show a time-
varying morphology. The precise temporo-spatial appearance of these IEDs depends on the extent
and location of the underlying epileptic brain network. These complex dynamics make generalized
IEDs challenging to differentiate from ‘normal’ background activity, even for experienced human
reviewers. Characterization of generalized IEDs in the time-frequency domain is a potential method
to aid manual markup, and may assist with the development of automatic IED detection approaches.
    Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is one form of epilepsy where generalized IEDs are frequent.
LGS is a severe, childhood-onset epilepsy associated with drug-resistant seizures, characteristic scalp
EEG patterns, and disabling cognitive and behavioural impairments that worsen over time [Archer et
al., 2014b; Intusoma et al., 2013]. Onset of LGS is typically heralded by a plateauing of cognitive
development or loss of previously acquired cognitive skills, in part due to the impact of frequent
epileptic activity on the developing brain [Halász et al., 2004; Warren et al., 2016].
   ~8-20 Hz generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA) is a characteristic of the interictal EEG in
LGS. Clinical assessment of these events is currently performed manually by human experts who are
required to carefully review each page of EEG over a recording that may last 24 hours or more.
Although clinically informative, this process is subjective, time-consuming, and often impractical.
Due to time constraints, careful manual review of the entire recording is rarely performed, with human
reviewers instead ‘estimating’ the IED burden from only a sample of the total recording.
   A small number of commercial ‘automated spike detection’ software programs are beginning to
be used in epilepsy monitoring units (examples of such programs include ones developed by
Compumedics1, Natus2, and Cadwell3). However, these programs were developed specifically for the
detection of monomorphic focal IEDs as opposed to bursts of generalized discharges, which are
typically more challenging for automatic detection algorithms due to their highly variable duration
and morphology. Hence, these programs are not currently suitable for detection of GPFA in patients
with LGS, in whom automated detection is likely to have important clinical benefits. For example,
automatic quantification of GPFA burden may provide an objective and complementary measure of
treatment response in patients undergoing therapeutic clinical trials [Cross et al., 2017].
    In this study, we investigated EEG signal dynamics of GPFA in the time-frequency domain in a
cohort of children with LGS. We showed that GPFA displays a consistent spectral power
‘bimodality’. To evaluate the utility of this feature, we searched for segments of patients’ EEG
recordings with similar time-frequency properties. This was achieved by developing a novel
automatic IED detection algorithm based on band-pass filtering of scalp EEG electrodes within two
frequency intervals of interest, followed by integration of their instantaneous power envelopes across
all scalp electrodes. Reliability of the automatically detected events was evaluated in two ways: (i)
we assessed true positives by comparing automatically detected GPFA events to the events detected
by manual human markup; and (ii) we assessed biological plausibility of false positive events (i.e.,
automatically detected events that were not identified in the manual human markup) by investigating
simultaneous EEG-fMRI brain maps derived from manually marked and automatically detected
events separately: the key hypothesis here was that if the automatically detected ‘GPFA-like’ events

manual human markup of IEDs.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Patients and simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisition
    Thirteen children with LGS underwent EEG-fMRI at the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne,
Australia. In all cases, diagnosis of LGS was defined by (i) multiple seizure types, including tonic
seizures; (ii) routine interictal EEG showing GPFA and bursts of <3 Hz slow spike-and-wave (SSW);
and (iii) cognitive and/or behavioural impairment [Arzimanoglou et al., 2009; Warren et al., 2019].
The study was approved by the Royal Children’s Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee and
all patients’ parents/legal guardians gave written consent prior to participation. Patients’ EEG-fMRI
results derived from manual EEG markup are reported in [Warren et al., 2019]. Their electroclinical
details are summarized here in Table 1.

    duration (in seconds) is provided for their manually marked GPFA events that were captured during EEG-fMRI scanning.

Neuroscan, Victoria, Australia) according to the 10-20 standard system. Data were recorded based on
the referential montage at the sampling rate of 5000 Hz.
2.1.1 Manual markup of generalized IEDs
   Each patient’s in-scanner EEG was marked by an epileptologist for multiple IED types including
GPFA. Table 1 summarizes the total number and cumulative duration of the GPFA event type for
patients in each group. An in-scanner example of GPFA is shown in Figure 1.

2.2 EEG-fMRI preprocessing
    fMRI data pre-processing followed our prior work [Warren et al., 2019]. Briefly, each patient’s
data were corrected for slice-timing and head motion and then spatially smoothed using a Gaussian
filter with full-width at half maximum of 6 mm.
   EEG recordings were pre-processed using Compumedics Profusion software4 version 4.0 and the
EEGLAB toolbox5 [Delorme and Makeig, 2004]. Gradient-switching and cardioballistic artifacts
were corrected using average artefact template subtraction methods. To avoid computational
limitations, the pre-processed EEG recordings were down-sampled to 100 Hz for further analysis.
2.3 Time-frequency characterization of GPFA
    To quantify the time-varying properties of the manually marked GPFA events, we converted them
to the time-frequency domain to reveal their joint temporal and spectral characteristics: this step was
performed because the morphology of a generalized IED evolves over both time and space (i.e., scalp
EEG electrodes). Additionally, its oscillations may ‘slow down’ or become ‘faster’ over the course
of an individual discharge. Therefore, an appropriate quantitative detection feature for generalized
IEDs must take three factors into account: (i) variable morphology, (ii) time-varying spectral content
before and after the event onset, and (iii) multi-electrode spatial distribution. Figure 2-A and Figure
2-B demonstrate the average spectrograms of all manually marked GPFAs in a subset of scalp EEG
electrodes selected from all LGS patients, calculated over a 6 s time window (-3 s to 3 s peri-onset).
The selected EEG electrode in each dataset was chosen as the electrode with maximum spectral power
across the frequency range of 8-20 Hz post-event onset. The relevance of this frequency band for
generalized IEDs is discussed in section 3.1. In 10 out of 13 datasets, the selected electrode was
located in the frontal scalp region. Visual inspection of these time-frequency representations
suggested a characteristic pattern of time-frequency changes between the pre- and post-onset intervals

in GPFA events. As shown in Figure 2-C and D, these pre-post event onset changes became more
apparent after demeaning the time-frequency maps along the time axis (i.e., each frequency row in
the maps was converted to have a mean value of zero). We observed a ‘bimodal’ burst of increased
spectral power immediately following GPFA onsets that was most apparent in frontal electrodes and
was seen as a simultaneous increase in spectral power in a ‘low’ frequency range of approximately
0.3-3 Hz and a ‘high’ frequency range of approximately 8-20 Hz. Based on these observations, we
hypothesized a general outline for characterization of GPFA in LGS as follows:
   GPFA is an interictal EEG event associated with a burst of post-onset low to high frequency
activity spanning a frequency range of ~0.3-20 Hz across multiple, particularly frontal, scalp EEG
electrodes. This increased spectral power shows a bimodal pattern consisting of a low frequency
patch over ~0.3-3 Hz and a higher frequency patch over ~8-20 Hz.
   To test this hypothesis, we considered three subject-specific parameters for each IED type in the
time-frequency domain: (i) a post-onset low-frequency band (Δ"# in Hz), (ii) a post-onset high-
frequency band (Δ$# in Hz), and (iii) a subset of EEG electrodes with maximal high-frequency
information over Δ$# . The peri-onset interval was defined as one second before to two seconds after
each manually marked IED onset time. To estimate the upper limit of Δ"# in each patient, we divided
the mean time-frequency representation of each IED type into pre- and post-onset regions. We then
projected the two time-frequency planes along the frequency axis and selected the upper cut-off
frequency of Δ"# as the frequency at which the derivative of their difference changed from negative
to positive. To estimate the mid-frequency of Δ$# , we detected the peak of consistent spectral
‘bumps’ above Δ"# before and after the onset. We defined the extent of Δ$# as the full width at half
maximum of the detected peak. This analysis was performed for each patient separately.

   onset of manually marked events over (A) all events and all patients (N=13), (B) the same events and patients as (A) , but here
    demeaned along each frequency row (i.e., demeaning was performed along the time axis). A burst of post-onset low to high
 frequency activity is observed in the time-frequency maps spanning a frequency range of ~0.3-20. This increased spectral power
     shows a ‘bimodal’ pattern consisting of a low-frequency patch over ~0.3-3 Hz and a high-frequency patch over ~8-20 Hz.



2.4 Validation of the time-frequency feature via automatic IED detection
    To validate the utility of the identified time-frequency feature in automatically detecting GPFA
events, we searched for EEG segments with similar bimodal spectral behaviour throughout the whole
of each patients’ in-scanner EEG recording. The rationale here was that if the time-frequency
arrangement of GPFA is a reliable and general feature across patients, it should occur during both
manually marked GPFA segments as well as ‘GPFA-like’ segments that were not identified in the
original manual markup (as for example may occur when a ‘subtle’ event occurs that does that pass
the subjective detection threshold for a human reviewer). Hence our automatic detection procedure
is likely to yield both ‘true positives’ (i.e., events which coincide with the manually marked GPFA
segments) as well as ‘false positives’ (i.e., events which do not coincide with the manually marked

GPFA segments but which share similar bimodal spectral behaviour). In the following sections, we
describe the automatic detection procedure and explain how its true/false positives were quantified.
2.4.1 Automatic detection procedure
    Figure 3-A and Figure 3-B show flow diagrams of the proposed automated event detection strategy
at the single-channel and multi-channel levels for a typical EEG dataset. The strategy comprises two
main steps: (i) analysis of each EEG channel separately (Figure 3-A), and (ii) integration of the
channel-wise analyses (Figure 3-B). At the single-channel level, band-amplitude fluctuations (BAFs)
of each channel are extracted using the Hilbert transform. The BAF envelope of a signal 𝑋(𝑡) is
defined as the absolute value of the analytic associate of its filtered version within a frequency band
Δ𝑓, i.e., 𝑋(𝑡, Δ𝑓) [Omidvarnia et al., 2014]. Mathematically, it is calculated by:

                  𝐵𝐴𝐹! (𝑡, Δ𝑓) = +𝑋(𝑡, Δ𝑓) + 𝑖𝑋/(𝑡, Δ𝑓)+ = 0𝑋 " (𝑡, Δ𝑓) + 𝑋/ " (𝑡, Δ𝑓)                                        (Eq. 1)

    where 𝑋)(𝑡, Δ𝑓) is the Hilbert transform of 𝑋(𝑡, Δ𝑓) and 𝑖 = √−1. Zero-phase band-pass filtering
is first performed using a Butterworth filter of order 4 in both forward and backward directions6. The
BAF of a signal represents its time-varying spectral power within the selected frequency band Δ𝑓
only (i.e., BAF extraction preserves the spectral content of an event over time within a selected
frequency range while excluding other frequency components that are not of interest).

              arrow). The bottom line shows a ‘false positive’ event (red arrow) which is outside of ∆𝑫𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒄𝒕 (black arrow).



   Figure 3-C and Figure 3-D show, for one example dataset, the BAF envelopes for an interictal
EEG segment in a typical electrode (here, C4) within a low frequency band of Δ𝑓 = [3 8] Hz and a
high frequency band of Δ𝑓 = [15 30] Hz. The first step in the proposed spike detection approach is to
extract two BAF envelopes for each EEG electrode within the pre-defined frequency bands Δ"# and
Δ$# . Figure 3-A illustrates the schematic of this process for a single EEG channel. For a multi-channel
EEG dataset with 𝑁%&'( number of electrodes, the per-channel BAF extraction procedure leads to
2𝑁%&'( BAF envelopes. The per-channel BAF signals are then integrated via multiplication over all
channels at each time point: this step yields what we define here as a ‘scoring signal’ with a duration
equal to that of the entire EEG recording (red arrow in Figure 3-B). For each time-point, the scoring
signal indicates the degree to which there is simultaneous high power within both Δ"# and Δ$#
frequency bands across the intersection of all EEG channels. An increase in the scoring signal is
therefore associated with the potential occurrence of a GPFA-like event with maximal information
within these bands. The desired events are then detected by selecting supra-threshold time points of
the scoring signal after merging adjacent events that are closer than a pre-defined time length, which
we refer to as a ‘merging window’ (here, 0.5 s). We used this merging step to avoid detecting multiple
events that are closer than 0.5 s apart because such closely spaced events are more likely to represent
a single GPFA burst. Section 2.4.2 explains the choice of our scoring signal threshold.
   Given that obtaining Δ"# and Δ$# relies on an initial manual EEG markup, we first estimated these
frequency bands using the manually marked datasets of our LGS cohort and then used this estimation
as a priori knowledge for our automatic IED detection procedure. In line with the results of the group
average time-frequency maps of Figure 2, we fixed Δ"# to [0.3 3] Hz and Δ$# of [8 20] Hz.
2.4.2 True and false positive rates with reference to manual EEG markup
   A key issue regarding the validity of the automatically detected events is the choice of an
appropriate threshold to apply to the scoring signal, above which a potential GPFA-like event is
flagged in our automatic detection procedure (Figure 3-B). To address this, we repeated the detection
method for each patient’s dataset at multiple thresholds from 5% to 95% of the scoring signal
amplitude in 5% increments (i.e., 19 thresholds in total per dataset) and counted the number of true
and false positive events (TPs and FPs, respectively) at each threshold.
   The TP and FP events were defined as follows: we considered each event (either automatically
detected event or manually marked GFPA) as a Dirac delta function with zero duration and treated
the set of events as a binary pulse train. We deemed an automatically detected event and a manually
marked event as ‘similar’ if their corresponding delta functions were within an adjacency interval
Δ)*+*%+ around the time onset of each manually marked GPFA event. Automatically detected events
outside all adjacency intervals were considered to be FP events. Figure 3-E illustrates examples of
TP and FP events with respect to a Δ)*+*%+ of -0.5 s to 1 s peri-onset. This comparison process yielded
a patient-specific spike detection profile for each EEG dataset where the true positive rate (TPR) is
plotted across multiple scoring signal threshold levels, as in Figure 4. The threshold applied to each
patient’s scoring signal was thus defined as the peak of their spike detection profile, reflecting the
threshold at which the TPR was maximal. For each patient, the TPR was defined as:
                                                               𝑁() (∆$%&%'& )
                                         𝑇𝑃𝑅(∆$%&%'& ) =                                                                      (Eq. 2)
                                                                 𝑁*+,-+.
    where 𝑁,- (∆)*+*%+ ) is the number of manually marked GPFA events which had at least one
corresponding automatically detected event in the proximity of their adjacency interval and 𝑁.'(/'0
is the total number of manually marked GPFA events (Table 1). The false positive rate (FPR) was
defined as:

   where 𝑁#- is the number of automatically detected events which were outside all adjacency
intervals (i.e., 𝑁#- (∆)*+*%+ ) = 𝑁.'(/'0 − 𝑁,- (∆)*+*%+ )). In this study, we used two different values
for ∆)*+*%+ , i.e., -0.5 s to 0.5 s and -0.5 s to 1 s peri-onset intervals.
2.4.3 Testing the biological plausibility of ‘false positives’ via EEG-fMRI analysis
   Validation of FPs in the proposed automatic GPFA detection procedure is a non-trivial challenge.
Although the FP events do not temporally coincide with the manually marked GPFA events (i.e., the
‘gold standard’), it is plausible that FPs represent genuinely epileptic events that were missed by the
human expert due to, for example, markup fatigue (as is likely to occur when manually marking up
lengthy EEG recordings) and/or subjective decision-making concerning the threshold at which the
manually identified event is deemed to be GPFA or not. Alternatively, some proportion, or even all
automatically detected events could be erroneous. In this study, we therefore chose to assess the
biological plausibility of FPs by analysing their associated brain hemodynamic response maps using
simultaneous fMRI recordings. Our rationale for this analysis was that if FPs are indeed biologically
meaningful epileptic events, their brain hemodynamic response maps should resemble the maps
derived from manually marked IEDs. A standard event-related general linear modelling (GLM) EEG-
fMRI analysis approach was used [Bénar et al., 2002]. We treated the EEG events as a binary
sequence of Dirac delta functions and convolved it with the canonical hemodynamic response
function (HRF) available in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software, as well as its first-order
derivatives with respect to time and space (i.e., a total of three event-related regressors of interest
were included per GLM). As regressors of no interest, we included 6 head motion parameters in the
GLM: these parameters were derived from the rigid volume realignment step performed during fMRI
pre-processing. For each patient, we performed simultaneous EEG-fMRI analysis using the timing
information derived from the automatically detected TP and FP events (each of these analyses were
performed twice, once for each of the two ∆)*+*%+ intervals ). In addition, we repeated the analyses
using the manually markup GPFA events. This led to 78 separate EEG-fMRI analyses (13 patients ×
3 event types [TP, FP, and manually marked] × 2 adjacency intervals). For each analysis, a statistical
parametric map of hemodynamic signal change was obtained by an F-test across the three event
regressors of interest.
   We hypothesized that if the detected FP events are non-biological, they should lead to spurious
statistical parametric maps with low similarity to the maps derived from manual markup. We tested
this hypothesis by calculating the pairwise spatial cross-correlation between the F-statistic maps
associated with the FPs and the F-statistic maps associated with manual markup7, where a high
correlation value indicates that the two maps under consideration are spatially similar. F-maps were
compared under two circumstances: (i) without statistical thresholding and (ii) after statistical
correction using an uncorrected voxel-wise p-value of 0.001 followed by a corrected cluster-wise p-
value of 0.05 using Gaussian Random Field Theory [Friston et al., 1994]. All GLM analyses were
performed using SPM version 12 running in MATLAB version R2016a [Veltman and Hutton, 2001].
3 Results
3.1 Estimated frequency intervals
   The group-average time-frequency maps of GPFA events in Figure 2 were seen at the individual
level (i.e., a bimodal spectral arrangement was observed in each patient’s interictal EEG dataset). The
mean low frequency band Δ"# was ~ [0.3 2.7] Hz and the mean high frequency band was Δ$# = ~
[8.8 12.6] Hz. The high frequency band Δ$# extended as low as [3.3 5.7] Hz in subject S1 to [15.9
17.6] Hz in subject S5. Across the group, most scalp EEG channels showing the greatest high
frequency power over Δ$# were located in frontal and pre-frontal areas (10 of 13 patients). Table 2
summarizes the estimated frequency intervals (i.e., Δ"# and Δ$# ) of GPFA events for all patients.

3.2 Assessing true positives via comparison with manual markup
   Using the mean high/low frequency bands estimated across all patients (see section 3.1), we
performed the proposed automatic event detection procedure (Figure 3) using the fixed frequency
bands of Δ"# = [0.3 3] Hz and Δ$# = [8 20] Hz. For each detection, we defined TP and FP events
under two scenarios: strict comparison with ∆)*+*%+ = -0.5 s to 0.5 s peri-onset and less strict
comparison with ∆)*+*%+ = -0.5 s to 1 s peri-onset.
In general, the number of automatically detected events was considerably higher than the number of
manually marked GPFA events. This was reflected in the number of FPs (𝑁𝐹𝑃 ) compared to the
number of TPs (𝑁𝑇𝑃 ). 𝑁𝐹𝑃 varied from 367±179 FP detected events for the strict comparison scenario
(i.e., ∆$%&%'& = -0.5 s to 0.5 s peri-onset) to 412±221 detected events for the less strict comparison

Figure 4 demonstrates the individual analysis results under the strict and less strict comparison
scenarios separately. In the figure, the left column is associated with color-coded spike detection
profiles extracted from the LGS datasets. Maximum TPR values associated with the peaks of the spike
detection profiles are also plotted as bar plots on the right side.


3.3 Assessing False Positives: EEG-fMRI analysis
    For each patient, we investigated the spatial correlations between the manual markup F-map and
its corresponding F-map generated from (i) all automatically detected events (i.e., the combination
of TPs and FPs), and (ii) FPs only.

  from manual markup of GPFA events versus all automatically detected events as well as false positive events only. All values are
                          normalized between 0 (minimum spatial similarity) and 1 (full spatial overlap).

markup maps and the maps of all detected events was r=0.71±0.13. This correlation was somewhat
reduced for the F-maps of the FP events to 0.63±0.09 (see Table 4).

    We repeated the abovementioned spatial correlation analysis for the statistically corrected F-maps
at the voxel-wise p<0.001 followed by a cluster-wise p<0.05 correction for multiple comparisons. As
Table 4 shows, the application of a statistical thresholding to the F-maps led to a reduction in the
spatial correlation values, presumably due to fewer brain voxels that were present in the F-maps after
the statistical correction was applied (i.e., r=0.37±0.33 for the maps of all detected events; and
r=0.16±0.19 for the maps associated with the FP events only, all obtained at Δ)*+*%+ = -0.5 s to 0.5 s
peri-onset). As Table 4 suggests, changing Δ)*+*%+ to -0.5 s to 1 s peri-onset did not have an obvious
impact on the spatial correlation values, similar to what was observed for the uncorrected F-maps.

4     Discussion
    Our study reveals a bimodal time-frequency feature associated with GPFA, a generalized IED type
characteristic of the interictal EEG in LGS. Our automatic IED detection approach can highlight
interictal EEG segments with similar time-frequency information and can thus identify EEG events
that are likely similar to manually marked IEDs. The validity of this approach is demonstrated by
spatial correlation analysis showing that EEG-fMRI brain maps derived from ‘false positives’ only
(i.e., automatically detected EEG events which were not originally marked up manually) are
comparable to those derived from manual IED markup.
   Bimodality in the spectral content of GPFA implies that these IEDs carry nested high frequency
information that is superimposed upon slower fluctuations occurring during peri-IED intervals. This
feature spans a low-frequency band of ~ 0.3 to 3 Hz, and a high-frequency band of ~ 8 to 12 Hz which
in some patients may extend up to 20 Hz. Scalp EEG electrodes associated with frontal and pre-
frontal areas tend to show the greatest high frequency power in the GPFA events, consistent with our
earlier work suggesting a key role of frontal cortex in driving GPFA [Warren et al., 2019].
   These results build on our previous study [Omidvarnia et al., 2018] which developed an automatic
detection method for focal IEDs (i.e., events which are concentrated in time and space) in focal
epilepsy patients. In contrast to this previous study, which focussed on detecting epileptic discharges
with uniform morphology over time at a single EEG channel, automatic detection of generalized IEDs
presents additional unique challenges: (i) the precise onset time of generalized discharges can be
difficult to define with respect to the EEG background; (ii) even within a single patient, there is often
variability in morphology and frequency from one discharge to the next, or over the course of a
discharge train; and (iii) discharges can be spatially variable and show propagation over multiple
EEG channels. Our current work aimed to address these challenges by inspecting generalized IEDs
across multiple EEG channels and characterizing their joint temporo-spectral behaviour.

               Examplary F-maps obtained from EEG-fMRI analysis of GPFA events




 Figure 7: F-maps of EEG-fMRI analysis based on the timing of GPFA events for subjects S3 and S13 as two exemplary cases with
 high spatial agreement between automatic IED detection and manual markup. Acronyms: TP = True Positive, FP = False Positive.

   Time-frequency characterization of manually marked GPFA events suggests that their bimodal
spectral behaviour is robust over patients. However, the specific frequency bands of interest may vary
considerably across individuals. We assessed the robustness of this time-frequency feature via an
automatic search for similar dynamics throughout patients’ interictal EEG recordings. We
hypothesized that if this EEG signal feature is reliable across patients, it should be able to highlight
both manually marked IEDs as well as IED-like events that were ‘missed’ in the manual markup.
Across patients, the agreement between manually marked IEDs and automatically detected events
varied from ~40% to ~80% for the two IED types. Even though the number of false positives was
generally higher than the number of manually marked IEDs (see the 𝑁#- columns in Table 3), their
associated statistical parametric maps generated from EEG-fMRI analysis were spatially similar to
the corresponding EEG-fMRI maps derived from manual markup. This spatial overlap is above r=0.5
in most analyses, when the zero-thresholded F-statistical maps are compared. It is also similar for the
F-maps extracted from false positives only and the maps generated based on the combination of true
and false positives. Spatial overlap is reduced in both IED groups after statistical correction of the
EEG-fMRI F-maps. This is also reflected in the group-mean correlation values of GPFA in Table 4.
Less strict comparison of the automatically detected events with reference to manual markup (i.e.,
post-onset interval of 1 s in contrast to 0.5 s in Δ)*+*%+ ) had negligible impact on the spatial correlation
values of the F-maps. This finding suggests EEG-fMRI analysis of GPFA may show some resilience
to minor variability in the precise EEG onset of IEDs (either manually marked or automatically
detected), perhaps due to the comparatively slow event-related hemodynamic response measured by
fMRI.
  The promising detection results may facilitate faster simultaneous EEG-fMRI analysis in LGS.
This is important because it may assist with pre-surgical planning for LGS, for example in guiding

optimal thalamic stimulation targets in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation [Archer et al.,
2014a] or identifying potentially resectable epileptogenic cortical lesions.


5    Conclusion
   GPFA shows a characteristic bimodal time-frequency feature that can be automatically detected
in patients with LGS. Utility of this time-frequency feature is demonstrated by EEG-fMRI analysis
of automatically detected EEG events, which recapitulates the brain network patterns we have
previously shown to underlie manually marked generalized IEDs in LGS.
