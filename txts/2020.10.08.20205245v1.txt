 2   Low-level chronic inflammation increases with age and is associated with cognitive decline. DNA
 3   methylation (DNAm) levels may provide more stable reflections of cumulative inflammatory burden
 4   than traditional serum approaches. Using structural and diffusion MRI data from 521 individuals aged
 5   73, we demonstrate that a DNAm proxy of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) shows significantly (on average
 6   6.4-fold) stronger associations with brain structural outcomes than serum CRP. We additionally find
 7   that DNAm CRP has an inverse association with global and domain-specific (speed, visuospatial and
 8   memory) cognitive functioning, and that brain structure partially mediates this CRP-cognitive
 9   association (up to 29.4%), dependent on lifestyle and health factors. These data support the hypothesis
10   that chronic systemic inflammation may contribute to neurodegenerative brain changes which underlie
11   differences in cognitive ability in later life. DNA methylation-based predictors could be used as proxies
12   for chronic inflammatory status.

14   Low-level, systemic chronic inflammation has emerged as a hallmark and potential driver for
15   individual differences in brain ageing, with numerous animal and human studies showing links
16   between sub-acute chronic inflammation and poor brain health1–7. While acute inflammation is a
17   healthy, short-term reaction to tissue damage or infection, low-level chronic inflammation is
18   characterised by an ongoing, heightened activity of the immune system that damages cells and tissues.
19   Incidence of peripheral chronic inflammation appears to increase as we age and is strongly associated
20   with age-related diseases including dementia and cardiovascular disease8. A striking feature of
21   cognitive ageing at the population level is its wide heterogeneity, with some individuals experiencing
22   more rapid or severe cognitive decline than others9 (Figure 1); the determinants of such differences in
23   age-related cognitive decline are not fully understood, but the shift to a progressive, chronic
24   inflammatory state in older-age – termed ‘inflammaging’10 – may be a key contributor to inter-
25   individual differences in cognitive ageing.
26   However, while chronic inflammation has been independently linked to various neurodegenerative
27   phenotypes11–14, the relationship between low level systemic chronic inflammation and cognitive
28   decline in healthy ageing (i.e. in the absence of neurodegenerative disease) is less clearly defined.
29   Studies using serum inflammatory measures in non-clinical groups show mixed positive, negative and
30   null associations with respect to cognitive outcomes2,15–21, and have not yet clarified the magnitude
31   and regional extent of brain structural associations3–6,22,23. Limitations of previous studies include
32   disparity in methodology (different imaging metrics and cognitive measures), small sample sizes
33   (typically, n <100, although a recent study looked at chronic inflammation in association with
34   cognitive and neuroimaging measures in over 2,000 participants23) and a lack of screening for acutely
35   elevated inflammation levels suggestive of infection24. Variation in participant health is a likely
36   source of such heterogeneity between study cohorts, as different lifestyle factors are known to
37   increase susceptibility to chronic inflammation (e.g. smoking, obesity, and alcohol consumption) and
38   the related health consequences of inflammation-driven damage (including metabolic syndrome, type-
                                                                                                                                    3

39   2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative pathology) may serve to perpetuate a
40   chronic inflammatory state8,25. Moreover, while many studies have investigated the relationship
41   between chronic inflammation and brain health outcomes, few consider all three variables
42   (inflammation, cognitive ability, neuroimaging) concurrently4.
43   Perhaps the largest shortcoming of previous work, however, is how low-level chronic inflammation is
44   measured. As there are no standard biomarkers for low-level chronic inflammation, to date many
45   studies have relied upon canonical blood biomarkers of acute inflammation such as C-Reactive
46   Protein (CRP) to index chronic inflammatory states. A caveat of this methodology is inferring
47   baseline inflammation levels from highly phasic protein levels, which are subject to swift and rapid
48   concentration changes in blood plasma. Serum CRP levels, for example, can increase up to 1,000-fold
49   in response to infection and vary from 1 µg/mL to 500 µg/mL within 24-72h of tissue injury26. Thus,
50   the properties which make CRP a good measure of acute infection also introduce significant noise
51   when looking at chronic inflammation associations at the epidemiological level (see Figure 1a). Few
52   studies take repeated measures of serum CRP or attempt to control for this variation when
53   investigating relationships with CRP and brain health phenotypes; where this is collected, longitudinal
54   stability in CRP profiles is low, with large intra-subject variability27.
55   Recent advances in the use of epigenetics to investigate long-term health outcomes21,28,29 may present
56   a solution to the challenge of reliably recording average inflammation levels. DNA methylation
57   (DNAm) is an epigenetic mechanism where the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine-phosphate-
58   guanine (CpG) nucleotide base pairing regulates gene activity30. DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles
59   are increasingly recognised as biomarkers of disease status and historical archives of environmental
60   exposures31–33 and differential DNAm profiles have been identified in inflammatory diseases34,35 and
61   inflammation-related disease outcomes36. In contrast to genetic variation, DNAm levels vary across
62   the lifecourse37 and can be affected by both genes and the environment38; measuring DNAm profiles
63   may therefore allow us to tease apart which aspects of lifestyle contribute to chronic inflammation. In
64   addition, while DNAm levels are dynamic, their short term variability is relatively stable39, and they
                                                                                                                                    4

65   may reflect longer-term immune function40. In the same cohort as in the present study, a DNAm
66   proxy of CRP exhibited greater longitudinal stability and stronger associations with a single global
67   measure of cognitive functioning than blood based CRP levels21,41. Given this temporal stability, a
68   DNAm signature of inflammation could represent a cumulative, aggregate measure of chronic
69   inflammation analogous to the HbA1c test used to index average blood sugar levels for diabetics21.
70   We tested this suspected increase in signal:noise conferred by DNAm vs serum CRP on a large
71   number of global and regional measures of brain grey and white matter health to interrogate how
72   inflammation might contribute to cognitive ageing differences.
73   To date no study has investigated a DNAm measure of CRP relation to structural brain health
74   outcomes. Here we present a detailed comparison of association magnitudes between a serum and
75   DNAm measure of CRP in relation to multiple global and regional structural brain imaging measures,
76   and to various aspects of cognitive function and lifestyle in a well-characterised community-dwelling
77   sample of healthy adults in older age. We hypothesised that our epigenetic score of CRP, created from
78   an out of sample epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), would show significantly stronger
79   associations with brain health than serum levels across a range of detailed neuroimaging and cognitive
80   measures. We additionally investigate whether the association of inflammation with cognitive ability
81   is mediated via alterations to brain structure and how lifestyle factors affect this relationship.

 83   DNAm CRP is associated with global and regional brain volume
 84   We studied 521 older adults (aged ~ 73 years; see Supplementary Table 1) and looked at epigenetic vs
 85   serum inflammation associations across a range of cognitive, neuroimaging and lifestyle measures
 86   (Supplementary Table 2). To index chronic inflammation, an epigenetic measure of CRP (DNAm
 87   CRP) was assembled for each participant: methylation beta values for 7 CpG sites shown to have the
 88   strongest association with serum CRP levels were derived, multiplied by their standardised regression
 89   weights (taken from the largest meta-EWAS of CRP to date34, where CpGs were replicated across a
 90   range of cohorts: European, n =8,863, and African-American, n=4,111), and summed to generate a
 91   single DNAm CRP score per subject (CpG weights presented in Supplementary Table 5). We found
 92   that higher inflammatory burden, indexed by DNAm CRP scores, associated with poor cognitive and
 93   neuroimaging brain health outcomes (Supplementary Table 2). DNAm CRP exhibited significantly
 94   larger associations with brain structural MRI metrics (including global grey and white matter atrophy,
 95   poorer white matter microstructure and increased white matter hyperintensity burden) than serum
 96   CRP associations.
 97   Figure 2A illustrates these effect size differences for global neuroimaging measures, which were
 98   larger by 6.4-fold, on average, for DNAm CRP vs serum CRP associations. These DNAm CRP-
 99   associated brain structural changes were independent of anti-inflammatory drug-use and vascular risk
100   factors (Supplementary Table 5). Participants with a higher inflammatory burden on average had
101   greater overall brain atrophy, with higher DNAm CRP associating with lower total brain volume (β =
102   -0.197, pFDR = 8.42 x 10-6), grey matter volume (β = -0.200, pFDR = 1.66 x 10-5) and white matter
103   volume (β = -0.150, pFDR = 0.001).
104   After examining global brain structural alterations, we looked at specific regional cortical brain
105   associations with higher inflammation levels. We found regional heterogeneity in the patterning of
106   associations between CRP measures and cortical metrics: atrophy in frontal, anterior lateral and
107   medial temporal lobes were associated with higher DNAm CRP (Figure 2B); inflammation
                                                                                                                                     6

108   associations with brain cortical thickness are presented in the supplementary document
109   (Supplementary Figure 2). Overall, these results emphasise that the DNAm-CRP score associates with
110   lower cortical volume of specific brain regions (lateral and medial temporal regions of the brain),
111   which show overlap with those of serum CRP and unique variance (Figure 2B-vi), with DNAm CRP
112   reflecting atrophy above and beyond the serum CRP score.
113   DNAm CRP is associated with white matter microstructure in specific white matter tracts
114   Next, we investigated whether higher DNAm CRP was related to lower white matter microstructure
115   based on global and regional diffusion MRI (dMRI) measures by looking at inflammation
116   associations with white matter tract fractional anisotropy (FA; the directional coherence of water
117   molecule diffusion) and mean diffusivity (MD; the magnitude of water molecule diffusion). While
118   serum CRP-dMRI associations were null in all cases (all pFDR > 0.089) (Supplementary Tables 7 and
119   8), higher DNAm CRP score predicted overall lower general fractional anisotropy (gFA)
120   (β = −0.162, pFDR = 6.94 x 10-4) and higher general mean diffusivity (gMD) (β = 0.124, pFDR = 0.010).
121   For specific white matter tracts, the strongest associations were seen for the arcuate fasciculus and
122   uncinate fasciculus, with lower FA and higher MD with higher DNAm CRP (see Figure 3;
123   Supplementary Tables 7-8). For both global and regional measures across grey and white matter,
124   accounting for anti-inflammatory drug status and health and lifestyle covariates did not substantially
125   alter the magnitude or significance of these associations (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10).
126   Brain structure partly mediates the association of DNAm CRP with cognitive ability
127   As higher DNAm CRP levels were associated with lower cognitive performance both here
128   (Supplementary Table 2) and previously21, we quantified the degree to which brain structural
129   differences contribute to the inflammation-cognition association, and which facets show the strongest
130   unique contributions to this relationship. We used a structural equation modelling (SEM) framework
131   to simultaneously characterise the associations among CRP, brain and cognitive metrics, and also
132   specifically test the hypothesis that brain structure partially and significantly mediates associations
133   between measures of CRP and cognitive ability. Bivariate associations between all variables
                                                                                                                                     7

134   (inflammation, brain structure, cognitive ability and lifestyle measures) are provided in the
135   Supplementary document (Supplementary Table 8). While total brain (TB) volume, grey matter (GM)
136   volume, normal appearing white matter (NAWM) volume and white matter hyperintensity (WMH)
137   volume all emerged as significant mediators in single SEM models (percentage attenuation 10-21%;
138   Supplementary Table 12), multiple mediator models were used to test the degree to which each global
139   MRI metric contributed uniquely to mediation of the same association (Figure 4d). Here, the sum total
140   of MRI measures significantly mediated the association between DNAm CRP and general cognitive
141   ability (β = -0.047, pFDR = 0.002; percentage attenuation 29.4%). The unique contributions to this
142   variance (Figure 4d and Supplementary Table 13) were largest for NAWM volume (β = -0.029, pFDR
143   = 0.012) indicating that the loss of white matter integrity in particular may contribute to
144   inflammation-associated differences in cognitive functioning in older age. Finally, with the addition
145   of lifestyle and health covariates to our models, no aspect of brain structure remained a significant
146   mediator of the associations between DNAm CRP and general cognitive ability (see Figure 4,
147   Supplementary Tables 12 and 13).

149   In summary, this is the first time that an epigenetic score of CRP has been shown to associate with
150   differences in structural brain measures. We discovered that DNAm CRP shows consistently stronger
151   associations with brain structure than serum CRP (on average, 6.4 fold greater), that these
152   associations are not regionally homogeneous across the brain’s cortex, and that specific aspects of
153   brain structure partly mediate (up to 29.4%) associations between an epigenetic signature of CRP and
154   cognitive functioning, with lifestyle factors significantly attenuating this relationship.
155   We found regional heterogeneity in the patterning of associations between CRP measures and cortical
156   metrics, indicating differential regional vulnerability to chronic inflammation. Atrophy in frontal,
157   anterior lateral and medial temporal lobes were associated with increased DNAm CRP. The regional
158   overlap between DNAm CRP and serum CRP brain atrophy was strikingly consistent for both cortical
159   thickness and cortical volume, with higher DNAm CRP relating to a thinner cortex and lower volume
160   across a more widespread range of regions, but also identical regions to that of serum CRP.
161   Consistently, previous studies report structural changes associated with inflammatory markers in the
162   temporal and frontal cortices22,42. Differential patterns of pro-inflammatory receptor distribution in
163   brain vasculature and tissue are thought to contribute to both local and global brain atrophy43, and
164   increased receptor expression may underlie why some brain regions are more vulnerable to
165   inflammation than others. For example, in post-mortem Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, pro-
166   inflammatory cytokine receptor density and expression were upregulated in regions of
167   neurodegeneration, including the medial frontal and temporal cortices44. Divergent inflammatory
168   markers are also associated with ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke phenotypes, indicating that
169   differing inflammatory pathways and their impact on regional brain vasculature may underlie
170   subtypes of stroke45. Although the participants in this study were free of neurodegenerative
171   phenotypes such as stroke or AD, it is possible that sub-incident pathology (undetected lacunar stroke,

173   subjects free of history stroke or AD found that CRP was significantly related to progression of
174   carotid atherosclerosis, and that CRP had differential effects in different beds of the arterial brain
175   supply46. Overall, it appears that raised levels of inflammatory mediators contribute to localised brain
176   atrophy via their differential and detrimental effects on cerebrovasculature.
177   Our findings support the hypothesis that chronic systemic inflammation may contribute to changes in
178   brain structure which underlie differences in cognitive ability in later life (see Supplementary Figure 1
179   for suggested mechanisms). As normal appearing white matter volume emerged as the largest
180   contributor to the mediation of the association between DNAm CRP and a global measure of
181   cognitive ability, we suggest that the brain’s white matter may be particularly vulnerable to the
182   damaging impact of chronic inflammation, and that loss of white matter integrity may drive
183   inflammation-associated accelerated cognitive ageing. Relatedly, several studies have found
184   associations between reduced white matter volume and raised inflammatory mediators both in healthy
185   cohorts5,19,47 and those with chronic inflammatory conditions48. Possible mechanistic causes for this
186   matter-specific brain atrophy emerge from post-mortem studies looking at microglia deposition: in
187   AD brain samples, microglia activation is specifically increased in white matter relative to grey49,50.
188   Chronically elevated inflammation levels in the periphery can cause microglia to shift from a state of
189   comparative quiescence to one of chronic activation51, resulting in an enhanced inflammatory
190   response promoting neuronal cell death and subsequent cognitive decline. Moreover, microglia can
191   deteriorate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) from inside the brain, resulting in further infiltration of
192   inflammatory mediators from the systemic circulation (see Supplementary Figure 1)52. White matter is
193   supplied by the perforating arterioles and there is evidence that people with greater WMH burden
194   exhibit subtly increased BBB leakage, and in turn, that BBB leakage is associated with worse
195   cognition at a one year follow-up53. In a study on patients with systemic inflammatory arthropathies,
196   elevated inflammatory mediators were associated with increased imaging signs of small vessel disease
197   including perivascular spaces and WMH54. The areas of brain loss that were particularly associated
198   with the epigenetic CRP here (temporal cortices) are also areas where others have shown increased
199   BBB leakage in persons at risk of AD53,55. It therefore seems that damage to the BBB is a possible
                                                                                                                                    10

200   pathway through which sustained levels of inflammation in the periphery results in
201   neurodegeneration. In addition, increased endothelial inflammation markers have been reported in
202   subjects with increased WMHs56, providing more evidence for neurovascular mediated
203   neuroinflammation and subsequent downstream white matter loss.
204   In line with this, we found that higher DNAm CRP is related to ostensibly poorer white matter
205   microstructure (lower FA and higher MD). In particular, the white matter tracts of arcuate fasciculus
206   and uncinate fasciculus showed the most consistent significant relationships with DNAm CRP levels
207   (across both FA and MD), alongside significantly lower FA in the anterior thalamic radiation, which
208   is susceptible to the effects vascular risk and cognitive ageing57. Similar cohorts also show links
209   between white matter integrity and chronic inflammation: a faster decline in serum CRP levels was
210   related to greater white matter tract health, with declines in inflammation over six years predicting FA
211   in various white matter tracts47. Similarly, higher midlife CRP levels predicted reduced white matter
212   integrity in later life5. As with discrete regional cortical thinning, our results indicate that loss of white
213   matter integrity occurs at both regional and global levels, indicating that individual white matter tracts
214   may have differential vulnerability to the effects of chronic inflammation. Stronger microstructural
215   associations with DNAm CRP than serum CRP point towards potential utility in monitoring chronic
216   inflammation in AD or small vessel disease populations via epigenetic markers to characterise and
217   quantify inflammatory status.
218   Given that all mediations via brain structure were significantly attenuated by the addition of lifestyle
219   factors into our models, it is clear that various exposures and predisposing health attributes influence
220   the association between chronic inflammation and brain health. These included factors that showed
221   significant associations with higher inflammation levels (BMI, diabetes, smoking, alcohol
222   consumption and hypertension) in this study (see Supplementary Table 2) and others8,58. Many of the
223   lifestyle attributes associated with chronic inflammation (and probable perpetuators of it) are at least
224   partly modifiable, yet studies that have successfully targeted these risk factors and shown
225   corresponding reductions in inflammation levels are scarce8. Variation in serum levels may be
                                                                                                                                    11

226   confounding this relationship, and our data suggest that the DNAm-based predictor may act as a
227   quantifiable archive of the longitudinal effects of these exposures, and other unaccounted for health
228   and genetic profiles, that serum CRP levels fail to capture.
229   The strengths of the present work include the large sample size, array of multi-modal data, narrow age
230   range and ethnic homogeneity of our cohort; the concurrently-collected data were optimal for
231   interrogating the relationship between chronic inflammation and cognition from neuroimaging,
232   cognitive, epigenetic and lifestyle angles. Compared to recent EWAS-neuroimaging research, this
233   study is exceptionally well-powered with 521 participants after exclusions29. The narrow age-range
234   and ethnic homogeneity are simultaneously limitations of this study, as they restrict the degree to
235   which our findings can be related to other populations and limit our scope to identify inflammation-
236   brain health associations at other times of life. Equally, given the cross-sectional nature of this study,
237   we are unlikely to capture the effect of more age-related changes in inflammatory profile and
238   cognitive decline. Observed cognitive and brain structural alterations could be independently related
239   to a genetic-predisposition unaccounted for by our health and lifestyle covariates, such as metabolic-
240   syndrome or more niche vascular vulnerability. Although we endeavoured to remove participants with
241   cognition-related pathology (stroke, AD, Parkinson’s disease and MCI), these were screened via self-
242   reported diagnoses and we may be missing undiagnosed or subclinical incident neurodegenerative
243   pathology. While it is exciting to consider that DNAm levels could provide more accurate reflections
244   of chronic inflammatory status, more work is required to determine the direction and strength of this
245   association with brain health phenotypes. It is possible that chronic inflammation is not a cause, rather
246   a marker of, or even a response to, unrelated neurodegenerative phenotypes that can lead to changes
247   in cognitive ability. To disentangle directionality of effects, there is demand for studies that collect
248   repeated measures of DNAm, cognitive and neuroimaging data over time. A few cohorts, including
249   LBC1936, are suited to this type of longitudinal study as highlighted in a recent systematic review59;
250   to further strengthen causal inference or in cases where no such data is available, a two-sample
251   Mendelian Randomisation approach may be best suited.

252   These findings have clinical implications, for example, relating DNAm proxies of inflammatory
253   exposure to MRI patterns in neonates could shed light on the role of chronic inflammation and brain
254   structure in preterm infants, where chronic inflammation is of known brain health consequence but
255   disentangling maternal vs infant exposure is difficult60. Future studies should consider examining a
256   wider range of DNAm inflammatory markers (DNAm levels of interleukins, prostaglandins,
257   neurotrophins); looking at DNAm inflammatory markers in younger participants (where there is likely
258   greater variation in baseline inflammation levels); and looking at DNAm inflammatory markers in
259   specific brain pathology cases (e.g. multiple sclerosis patients).
260   In conclusion, these findings support the hypothesis that chronic systemic inflammation may
261   contribute to neurodegenerative brain changes which underlie differences in cognitive ability in later
262   life. Previous studies exploring this relationship may underestimate the brain and cognitive sequelae
263   of chronic inflammation by relying on single measurements of phasic serum proteins. By utilising an
264   epigenetic inflammation measure, which integrates information from multiple immune-related CpG
265   sites, we may provide a more reliable measure of chronic inflammation and thus a more
266   comprehensive overview of the consequences of chronic inflammation on brain structure and
267   function. Reliable monitoring of inflammatory exposure could enable clinicians to review the efficacy
268   of drug and lifestyle interventions to attenuate inflammation levels with a view to improving cognitive
269   outcomes.

271   Participants
272   Data are drawn from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936). The cohort is composed of 1,091
273   individuals, born in 1936 and re-contacted around 60 years later (mean age: 69.6 ± 0.8 years). Most
274   took part in the Scottish Mental Survey 1947 at age 11. Detailed cognitive, genetic, epigenetic, health
275   and lifestyle data was collected at this first wave, and also three years later, supplemented with a
276   detailed structural brain imaging protocol (see below). Participants were free of neurodegenerative
277   diagnoses at baseline and, as the study’s focus is on healthy cognitive ageing, were excluded if they
278   had a self-reported history of stroke (n=55), Parkinson’s (n= 5), or dementia (n=2) or had an MMSE <
279   24, indicating mild cognitive impairment (n=7). We additionally excluded participants with serum
280   CRP level >10mg/L (n = 32), suggestive of acute infection or illness at the time of blood draw 24.
281   After exclusions, a total of 680 participants had DNAm CRP data at age 73 years, 521 of whom also
282   provided brain MRI data. We used the maximum available sample size in all analyses. All variables
283   described in this study were collected at Wave 2.
284   Brain imaging data
285   Structural and diffusion tensor (DTI) MRI acquisition and processing in LBC1936 were performed
286   according to an open-access protocol 61. A 1.5 T GE Signa HDx clinical scanner (General Electric,
287   Milwaukee, WI, USA) was used to collect structural T1-, T2-, T2*-, and fluid attenuated inversion
288   recovery-weighted images. Total brain (TB), grey matter (GM), normal-appearing white matter
289   (NAWM) and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes were segmented using a semi-automated
290   multi-spectral technique 62. Local processing and QC of cortical reconstruction and segmentation was
291   performed using FreeSurfer v5.1 on T1-weighted volumes. Following visual inspection of the outputs
292   (to check for aberrant surfaces and tissue segmentation failures, which were removed from analysis)
293   these were registered to the fsaverage surface. White matter connectivity data – measures of fractional
294   anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) – were created and segmented using the
295   BEDPOSTX/ProbTrackX algorithm in FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk) and Tractor
                                                                                                                                    14

296   (https://www.tractor-mri.org.uk). Using probabilistic neighbourhood tractography (PNT), tract-
297   average white matter FA and MD were derived as the average of all voxels contained within the
298   resultant tract maps (genu of corpus callosum; splenium of corpus callosum; arcuate fasciculus;
299   anterior thalamic radiation; rostral cingulum; uncinate fasciculus; inferior longitudinal fasciculus), as
300   described previously 63,64. A general factor of FA (gFA) and MD (gMD) was derived for each participant
301   from the first un-rotated principal component of a principal components analysis (PCA) on twelve of
302   the white matter tracts FA and MD values; participants with up to 2 missing values from specific
303   tracts had data replaced with the mean value for that tract. These general factors reflect common
304   microstructural properties across main white matter pathways and capture the common variance in
305   white matter integrity. Details of individual test loadings are provided in the supplementary document
306   (Supplementary Table 3).
307   C-Reactive Protein data
308   Serum CRP was measured from whole-blood samples using a high sensitivity assay (enzyme-linked
309   immunosorbent assay; R&D Systems, Oxford, UK) 54.
310   DNA methylation preparation and DNAm CRP score
311   Genome-wide DNA methylation was measured in blood samples using the Illumina Human
312   MethylationEPIC BeadChip at the Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility Genetics Core; details of this
313   profiling has been outlined65. The DNAm CRP score was calculated for each participant as described
314   previously66, briefly, a DNAm CRP score was assembled for each participant in Wave 2 of LBC1936;
315   this was created by means of a weighted composite score, based on a discovery meta-analysis (9
316   cohorts, n =8,863) and a replication meta-analysis (4 cohorts, n = 4111) of CRP-EWAS studies 34.
317   Methylation beta values were derived for the 7 CpG sites shown to have the strongest association with
318   serum CRP levels, and then multiplied by their standardised regression weights (taken from the meta-
319   EWAS of CRP;34)and added together. Given that all regression weights from the EWAS were
320   negative, a higher DNAm CRP score (i.e closer to 0) corresponds to a higher inflammatory profile.
321   Relative weights for the 7 CpGs are included in the supplementary document (Supplementary Table
322   5).

323   Cognitive ability data
324   A general fluid-type cognitive ability score (gf) was derived from the first un-rotated principal
325   component of a PCA of relevant cognitive tests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third
326   Edition (WAIS-IIIUK)67. Relevant cognitive tests and individual weightings of gf and the latent
327   variables of processing speed, visuospatial ability and verbal memory can be found in Supplementary
328   Table 4.
329   Lifestyle variables
330   Lifestyle variables included body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) alongside variables relating to self-
331   reported health and disease history: cardiovascular disease history (CVD); hypertension; diabetes;
332   smoking status (coded as current smoker [1] versus ex/non-smoker [0]) and current alcohol use
333   (alcohol units per week).
334   Volumetric brain associations with inflammation
335   Linear regression models were used to identify the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by
336   DNAm CRP and to determine whether this was independent of the serum CRP signal for each
337   neuroimaging, cognitive and lifestyle phenotype. Logistic regressions were conducted for self-
338   reported disease history variables as these had binary outcomes (disease/no disease). The phenotypic
339   measure was the dependent variable, and the serum CRP or DNAm CRP score was the independent
340   variable of interest. Differences between association magnitudes (serum CRP vs epigenetic CRP
341   associations) were assessed using the Williams’ test for dependent groups with overlapping
342   correlations (cocor.indep.groups.overlaps) as implemented in the cocor R package (http://cran.r-
343   project.org/web/packages/cocor/cocor.pdf).
344   Regional brain analyses
345   Localized associations between DNAm CRP score and vertex-wise cortical volume, area and
346   thickness were performed using linear regression, controlling for age, sex, and ICV. We used the
347   SurfStat MATLAB toolbox (http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surf stat) for Matrix Laboratory R2012a
348   (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). The resulting statistical maps (t-maps) were corrected for
                                                                                                                                    16

349   multiple comparisons using FDR with a q-value of 0.05 across all 327,684 vertices on the cortical
350   surface. Negative associations with CRP measures (e.g. lower volume with higher inflammation)
351   were represented by the hot end of the colour spectrum. Following exclusions based on a history of
352   stroke, dementia or an MMSE < 24, n = 521 had complete vertex-wise MRI, epigenetic and
353   phenotypic data. White matter tract-specific associations with CRP measures were investigated using
354   regression models adjusted for age and sex as described previously for global volumetric measures
355   (TB, GM, NAWM, WMH).
356   Specific white matter tract associations with inflammation
357   As with volumetric brain-inflammation associations, regressions were run with regional FA and MD
358   values of left and right projections of the individual white matter tracts (genu of corpus callosum;
359   splenium of corpus callosum; arcuate fasciculus; anterior thalamic radiation; rostral cingulum;
360   uncinate fasciculus; inferior longitudinal fasciculus) as dependent variables.
361   Sensitivity analyses
362   We sought to investigate whether anti-inflammatory drug status had an influence on our models. In a
363   sensitivity analysis, anti-inflammatory drug status (collected at baseline and coded as a dichotomous
364   variable: on medication = 1; not on medication = 0) was included as a covariates alongside age and
365   sex. Similarly, we included lifestyle and health covariates separately in models (alongside age and
366   sex) to determine whether individual aspects of health and lifestyle had an impact on the association
367   of inflammation with brain-health phenotypes.
368   Mediation analyses
369   We ran mediation analyses in a structural equation modelling (SEM) framework using the R ‘lavaan’
370   package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lavaan/lavaan.pdf). This simultaneously
371   characterised associations among CRP, brain and cognitive metrics, and also specifically tested the
372   hypothesis that brain structure would partly and significantly mediate associations between measures

375   associations attributable to individual neuroimaging metrics. By contrast, in Multiple mediator
376   models, brain structural variables were entered simultaneously as covarying mediators. This allowed
377   us to quantify the proportion of variance in CRP-cognitive associations uniquely explained by each
378   facet of brain structure (GM, NAWM, WMH, gFA, gMD). The primary estimates of interest in this
379   study are the degree of change (mediation) in the direct path (c to c’) between inflammation measures
380   (DNAm CRP or serum CRP) and cognitive ability when the indirect path from inflammation to
381   cognitive ability via brain structure (a x b) is included. A significant mediation of the c path (to c’) is
382   denoted by the statistical significance of this indirect effect. Bootstrapping was used calculate the
383   standard errors. Multiple comparisons were corrected for by FDR correction. These mediations were
384   re-run when accounting for self-reported health variables as covariates. In Model 1 age and sex were
385   covariates; in Model 2, they were age, sex, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, smoking status and alcohol
386   use. Model fit was evaluated based on root mean squared error approximation (RMSEA), the
387   comparative fit index (CFI), the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) and the Tucker–
388   Lewis index (TLI). We considered a model an acceptable fit when it respected the following
389   thresholds: RMSEA ≤ 0.05; SRMR ≤ 0.06; CFI ≥ 0.97; TLI ≥ 0.95 as recommended by 68.
390   Statistical Analyses
391   Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.6.1 (https://www.rproject.org). Alpha was 0.05 for
392   all analyses and results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR)
393   using the ‘p.adjust’ function in the ‘stats’ package in R. Standardized coefficients are reported
394   throughout to facilitate comparison of associations. Serum measures of CRP were log-transformed to
395   correct a positively skewed distribution. When conducting analysis for brain structural associations, to
396   control for the confounding effect of head size, all global MRI volumetric measures (TB, GM, NAWM,
397   WMH) were corrected for intracranial volume (ICV) and expressed as a ratio of ICV. Pairwise bivariate
398   associations were assessed between markers of inflammation, neuroimaging and lifestyle covariates
399   using Pearson correlation.

 Fig. 1. Chronic inflammation increases with age and may contribute to variance in
 cognitive ability and brain structure
 (a) Schematic demonstrating how chronic inflammation increases with age (left panel) and can be indexed by
 inflammatory proteins taken from a blood sample (right panel), such as serum levels and DNA methylation
 (DNAm) proxies of C-Reactive Protein. Graphs below reflect trajectories of respective inflammation scores over
 age, as outlined in21. (b) Life-span curves for cognitive ability, demonstrating that there is considerable inter-
 individual heterogeneity in rate and timing of cognitive decline, with some people on more accelerated cognitive
 ageing trajectories than others9. (c) From left to right, schematic diagram displays structural and diffusion MRI (T1,
 T2, T2-FLAIR weighted, DTI) correlates of cognitive decline which include alterations in brain macrostructure,
 such as atrophy in grey matter (GM), normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and increased presence of white
 matter hyperintensities (WMH; indicated by red arrows). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can reveal alterations in
 measures of brain microstructure, such as global changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD);
 loss of individual white matter tract integrity can be inferred from probabilistic neighbourhood tractography (PNT)
 to extract white matter (WM) tracts of interest from DTI data.

Fig. 2. DNAm CRP shows stronger and more widespread associations with global and regional brain structure than serum CRP
(a) Associations between CRP measures and brain structure (n = 521); bars show standardised regression coefficients, error bars show standard errors. Asterisks indicate
significant differences (*P<0.05, **P<0.01; williams’ test) between serum CRP and DNAm CRP coefficients, which were 6.4-fold larger, on average, for DNAm CRP.
(b) Regional cortical volume regressed against serum CRP (i-ii) and DNAm CRP (iii-iv) n = 521. Colours denote the magnitude (T-maps; top) and significance (Q
values; bottom) of the negative associations between inflammation and brain cortical volume. Panel (v) shows the percentage attenuation for the significant associations
between DNAm-CRP and cortical volume when also controlling for serum CRP. Conjunction plot (vi) shows the spatial extent of independent contributions and overlap
(red) in cortical loci that exhibit FDR-corrected unique associations with simultaneously-modelled serum (pink) and epigenetic (blue) inflammation measures; results are
corrected for sex, age and ICV. TB: total brain, GM: grey matter, NAWM: normal-appearing white matter, WMH: white matter hyperintensity, gf, general cognitive
