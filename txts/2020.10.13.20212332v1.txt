        Abstract:

        N6-methyladenosine ( 𝑚6 𝐴               is the most commonly modified form of mRNA. 𝑀6 𝐴 RNA

        methylation regulators are proved to be expressed clearly in some cancers by plenty of studies.

        Moreover, they also are proved to be indirectly involved in the growth of cancers. However, it

        remains unclear that the role of 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation regulator in the prognosis of breast cancer

        (BRCA . The data that we used in this study is the mRNA expression data obtained from the

        corresponding clinical information and the Tumor Genome Atlas (TCGA database. And the goal

        we used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was to evaluate the difference in the expression of 𝑚6𝐴 RNA

        methylation regulators in the normal group and the tumor group, and analyze the correlation

        between 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation regulators. We identified two subgroups of BRCA (cluster1 and

        2 by using the K-mean algorithm and analyzing the correlation between clinic information and

        subgroups. The LASSO regression model then was used to figure out three 𝑚6𝐴 RNA methylation

        regulators, namely YTHDF3, ZC3H13, and HNRNPC. The riskScore of each patient was calculated

        according to the regression coefficients of the three 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation regulators. Base on the

        riskScore, we divided the patients into two groups, the high-risk group, and the low-risk group.

        After analyzing, we found that the overall survival rate (OS of the low-risk group was higher than

        that of the other group. We conducted a univariate and multi-factor independent prognostic analysis

        of riskScore and three 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation regulators, and found that riskScore has a significant

        correlation with BRCA.

        In conclusion, the 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation regulator is closely related to the development of BRCA,

        and the prognostic factor riskScore obtained from the regression of the expression of the three 𝑚6𝐴

        RNA methylation regulators in the human body are likely to guide the individualization of BRCA

        patients A useful prognostic biomarker for treatment.


        Introduction:

        BRCA occurring in the epithelial tissue of the breast is a malignant tumor, and 99% of the patients

        are women and the rest are men (1 , so it is considered to be the main cause of death in gynecological

        tumors. Due to advances in early screening and anti-cancer strategies, BRCA treatment(2 has

        improved significantly. However, BRCA still shows a high recurrence rate(3 , and the cause is not

        yet clear. We must establish a model to deal with the prognosis of BRCA patients.



        𝑚6 𝐴 (N6-methyladenosine, 6-methyl adenine                    is the most common post-transcriptional

        modification of eukaryotic mRNA, accounting for 80% of RNA methylation modifications(4 . As

        early as the 1970s, people had discovered 𝑚6 𝐴 modifications in the mRNA and lncRNA of

        eukaryotes(5 . It is known that in most eukaryotes, the methylation modification that occurs in the

        mRNA region of 5'UTR plays a significant role in mRNA splicing, editing, stability, degradation,

        and polyadenylation(6-8 ; while the modification of the 3'UTR region Methylation modification

        contributes to the nuclear transport of mRNA, the initiation of translation, and the structural stability

        of the mRNA together with the polyA binding protein (9 . 𝑚6 𝐴 methylase is widely involved in

        mammalian development, immunity, tumor generation and metastasis, stem cell renewal, fat

        differentiation, and other life processes. METTL3 and METTL14 can promote the self-renewal of

        hematopoietic stem cells, and regulate 𝑚6 𝐴 levels in the body in glioblastoma and liver cancer;

        FTO is the first 𝑚6 𝐴 demethylase discovered, both single-stranded, double-stranded RNA and

        DNA It has the function of demethylation and mainly acts on the 𝑚6 𝐴 site within the gene, as an

        oncogene to promote the occurrence of leukemia; besides, FTO is closely related to fat development;

        ALKBH5 can enhance the expression of its target gene FOXM1 and maintain the growth of glioma

        stem cells Growth; YTHDF1, YTHDF3, and YTHDC2 promote protein synthesis by improving the

        efficiency of 𝑚6𝐴 translators, while YTHDF2, YTHDF3, and YTHDC2 specifically recognize

        𝑚6 𝐴 mRNA and mediate mRNA degradation                  (10-14
                                                                         . More and more studies have proved that the

        development of cancer is deeply influenced by 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation regulators, but people have

        no further details about the relationship between 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation regulators and BRCA.

        Many studies construct prognostic signatures based on miRNAs (15 and long-chain non-coding
                              (16
        RNAs (lncRNAs               to predict the prognosis of BRCA. However, the prognostic signature that

        based on 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation modulators has not been constructed on the prediction of the

        prognosis of BRCA.



        In this study, we analyzed the differences in the correlation among these 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation

        regulators and the expression of 15 𝑚6𝐴 RNA methylation regulators(17 in BRCA are based on

        the data which is collected from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA database (18 . We constructed a

        regression mode with 3 𝑚6𝐴 methylation regulators selected after Cox univariate analysis and

        LASSO regression analysis with p-value<0.1. Then, we studied the prognostic value of riskScore

        in BRCA, finding 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation regulators take a significant part in the progression of

        BRCA. Moreover, their riskScore can be used as the prognosis of BRCA patients.



          Materials and methods

        Data Acquisition


        We used the data in the TCGA database (https://cancergenome.nih.gov/ to construct the RNA-seq

        transcriptome data of 1,222 BRCA patients and the corresponding clinicopathological and

        prognostic information.


        𝐦𝟔 𝐀 RNA methylation regulators selection


        In BRCA, there are 15 𝑚6 𝐴 -related genes and all of them have been identified as 𝑚6 𝐴

        methylation regulators. These 15 𝑚6 𝐴 -related genes have not been analyzed systematically in

        BRCA but have been analyzed systematically in pancreatic cancer. The BRCA mRNA expression

        data of 15 𝑚6 𝐴 -related genes were collected from the TCGA database and the expression of 15

        𝑚6 𝐴 -related genes and clinical-pathological variables in BRCA patients were used to analyze the

        relationship among them.


        Bioinformatics analysis


        Use the R “corrplot” package           (19
                                                     to study the interactions between 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation

        regulators, and then use the k-mean clustering algorithm (20 to classify tumors for further analysis.

        In order to define the prognostic values of 𝑚6𝐴 RNA methylation regulators in BRCA patients,

        then we used the data in the TCGA database to perform Cox univariate analysis(21 and selected

        𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation regulators with p-value<0.1 as the prognostic-related gene to construction

        model, and finally developed riskScore by LASSO regression algorithm(22 , which bases on a linear

        combination of regression coefficients and its expression level. The riskScore calculation method is

        as follows:
                                                                    𝑁

                                                                   𝑖=1

        Based on the median value of riskScore, we divided these BRCA patients into high-risk groups and

        low-risk groups, and the survival curve of the patients was drawn, and then the correlation between

        riskScore and clinical information was analyzed. Finally, riskScore and other clinical information

        are used as prognostic factors for independent prognostic analysis, and p-value<0.05 indicates

        statistically significant correlation.

        The situation of 𝒎𝟔 𝑨 RNA Methylation Regulators in BRCA


        First the expression levels of 15 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation regulators in 1109 BRCA cases and 113

        normal cases in the TCGA dataset were compared. Among them, the expressions of 11 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA

        METTL14, WTAP, RBM15, and YTHDF2 are significantly related (figure1A, B . We speculate it

        may be an inherent feature that the change in the ratio of 𝑚6𝐴 RNA methylation regulators,

        correlation. As shown in Figure 1C, The YTHDF1 gene is most probable to be up-regulated as the

        YTHDC1 gene is up-regulated, but the HNRNPA2B1 gene is most probable to be down-regulated

        when the FTO gene is up-regulated. The relationship between the pathological characteristics of

        BRCA, including age, gender, grade, status, stage, T status, M status, and N status and each 𝑚6 𝐴

        RNA methylation regulator was also systematically studied, finding that the 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA

        methylation regulator indeed has a relationship with the pathological characteristics of BRCA

        (Figure 1 d .


        Two Clusters of BRCA Identified In Consensus Clustering of 𝒎𝟔 𝑨 RNA
        Methylation Regulators


        We took 113 normal BRCA samples and used the R“ConsensusClusterPlus” package to group 1109

        cancer tissues. The CDF value of k = 3 in the TCGA data set seems to be small from the perspective

        of the expression similarity of 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation regulators (Figure 2B,C , but the correlation

        between the groups gets higher, and the number of samples gets smaller after being divided into

        three groups. Thus, the cancer tissues were grouped into two different kinds (Figure 2A .

        The categories determined by consensus clustering are closely related to clinical
        outcomes and clinical pathology feature

        The cluster results and OS curves of 1109 BRCA patients were analyzed to get better understanding

        of the cluster results and clinical efficacy and clinicopathological characteristics. In the cluster 2

        subgroup, we discovered that most of the 𝑚6𝐴 RNA methylation regulators were highly expressed.

        Moreover, compared the cluster 1 subgroup with the cluster 2 subgroup, we found that cluster 2

        subgroup was apparently correlated with stage and T status at the time of diagnosis (Figure 3 .

        prognostic value of 𝒎𝟔 𝑨 RNA methylation regulators and RiskScore

        To get better understanding of the prognostic role of 𝑚6𝐴 RNA methylation modulator in BRCA,

        we performed univariate Cox regression analysis for expression levels of them. After analyzing, the

        results showed that the higher the expression of ZC3H13 and YTHDF3 is, the lower the survival

        rate of BRCA patients is, and the lower the expression of HNRNPC is, the higher the survival rate

        of patients is (Figure 4A . For predicting the clinical outcome of 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation regulator

        on BRCA, the Least Absolute Contraction and Selection Operator (LASSO , and Cox regression

        algorithm was applied to 15 genes in the TCGA dataset. Based on the minimum criteria, we selected

        three genes (YTHDF3, ZC3H13, and HNRNPC to construct riskScore and used the coefficients

        gained from the LASSO algorithm to calculate the riskScore of the TCGA dataset (Figure 4B, C .

        Then BRCA patients in the TCGA data set were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups

        according to the median riskScore to explore the impact of three-gene risk characteristics on

        prognosis. The results showed that BRCA patients in the high-risk group had poorer survival

        DISCUSSION

        BRCA is one of the largest numbers of newly diagnosed cancer cases (23 , and Women who die of

        BRCA are second only to lung cancer (24 . Factors affecting the risk of BRCA development include

        history of breast disease in oneself and his family, age, Radiation exposure, race, and dietary factors.

        In 2016, the American Cancer Society predicted that approximately 249,260 new cases will be

        diagnosed, and 40,890 patients will die of breast cancer. Men can also get breast cancer(25 .

        Approximately 440 men will die of breast cancer in 2016. In the past few years, the incidence of

        breast cancer has decreased significantly around the world, but the 5-year survival rate of BRCA

        patients is still 67.6%(26 , and there are still many key issues that have not been resolved. To a certain

        extent, the decline in mortality is due to advanced medical examination methods(27 , advanced

        diagnostic techniques (28 , and advanced treatment methods (29 . Among them, targeted therapy has

        a very good effect in prolonging the survival time of patients, but the most challenging problem in

        tumor resistance and the burden on the economy. Therefore, exploring the molecular mechanism

        and new therapeutic targets of breast cancer is still a challenging topic.



        In our study, the three methylation regulators YTHDF3, ZC3H13, and HNRNPC are the most

        relevant to the risk of death. Recent studies have shown that YTHDF3 enhances 𝑚6 𝐴 modification

        mRNA (30, 31 . Our findings indicate that YTHDF3 mRNA is upregulated in breast cancer and is

        positively correlated with BRCA. Therefore, YTHDF3 amplification and upregulation of its

        transcript may promote the translation of oncogene targets in an 𝑚6 𝐴 -dependent manner, leading

        to the development of breast cancer. Inhibition of HNRNPC in breast cancer cells can inhibit cell

        proliferation and tumor growth(32, 33 . In our study, the higher the expression of HNRNPC, the lower

        the risk of death in breast cancer patients, which again confirms this conclusion. Regarding the role

        of ZC3H13 in breast cancer, it is currently unclear and needs future experiments to verify.



        It is significant to figure out whether 𝑚6𝐴 RNA methylation modulator has prognostic value for

        cancer. Three 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation modifiers were selected after Cox univariate analysis and

        LASSO Cox regression analysis to construct risk characteristics which divided BRCA patients into

        high-risk groups and low-risk groups. OS was suggested that it was significantly correlated with

        age, stage, T stage, N stage, and risk score in univariate analysis and multivariate analysis. The Cox

        regression model should be validated in other public databases because there is only one dataset

        from the TCGA database was used to validate it in our study.



        It has not been fully understood and lack of specificity up to now that the function and specific

        mechanism of 𝑚6 𝐴 demethylase inhibitors which are found in vitro and in vivo. Therefore,

        researchers are expecting more inhibitors, especially more specific inhibitors whose target is 𝑚6 𝐴

        -related factors will bring new light to the guidance of tumor gene targeted therapy. Also, it is

        demonstrated systematically that the expression, prognostic value, and function that has not been

        found of 𝑚6𝐴 RNA methylation regulators in breast cancer. The malignant clinicopathological

        characteristics of breast cancer are significantly correlated with the expression of 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA

        methylation regulators. Our study is significant because it provides further detection of the function

        of 𝑚6 𝐴 methylation in BRCA with important evidence.


        Conclusion

        𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation regulators are closely related to the clinicopathological characteristics of

        malignant tumors, and the prognosis of BRCA patients can be predicted independently by the risk

        characteristics of the three selected 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation regulators. The findings in our study

        provide significant evidence for the further study of 𝑚6 𝐴 RNA methylation modulators.
