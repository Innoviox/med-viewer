    Running title: SARS-CoV-2 Urinary Shedding/ Infectivity, Compared to Stool and Serum
    Abstract:
     Objective: Investigating the infectivity of body fluid can be useful for preventative measures in
    the community and ensuring safety in the operating rooms and on the laboratory practices.
    Methods: We performed a literature search of clinical trials, cohorts, and case series using
    PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Cochrane library, and downloadable database of CDC.
    We excluded case reports and searched all-language articles for review and repeated until the
    final drafting. The search protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database.
    Results: Thirty studies with urinary sampling for viral shedding were included. A total number
    of 1,271 patients were enrolled initially, among which 569 patients had undergone urinary
    testing. Nine studies observed urinary viral shedding in urine from 41 patients. The total
    incidence of urinary SARS-CoV-2 shedding was 8%, compared to 21.3% and 39.5 % for blood
    and stool, respectively. The summarized risk ratio (RR) estimates for urine positive rates
    compared to the pharyngeal rate was 0.08. The pertaining RR urine compared to blood and stool
    positive rates were 0.20 and 0.33 respectively.
    Conclusions: Our review concludes that not only the SARS-CoV-2 can be excreted in the urine
    in eight percent of patients but also its incidence may have associations with the severity of the
    systemic disease, ICU admission, and fatality rates. Moreover, the findings in our review suggest
    that a larger population size may reveal more positive urinary cases possibly by minimizing
                                                                         1

    serum that show more possibilities to became positive, respectively.

    Introduction
    Urinary viral shedding can be important from the aspects of diagnosis, vertical and horizontal
    transmission of infection (1). Viral shedding has been proven for some other contagious viruses including
    the Ebola virus, Zika virus, and hepatitis-B virus (2, 3).
    Up to date, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to 213 countries and territories and infected over 28,000,000 patients
    around the globe with around 1,000,000 death toll (4). Before Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), the
    latest coronavirus outbreaks were the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1)
    and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks. For SARS-COV-1, the
    urinary positivity rates were reported to be up to 42% (5). SARS-CoV-2 structural features are similar to
    both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV which all belong to the family Coronaviridae (6).
    The presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been shown in urine (7-12). Angiotensin-converting enzyme-II
    (ACE2) has been known as the cellular entry receptor of SARS‐ CoV‐2 (13, 14). The cells with ACE-II
    receptors such as epithelia of lung, kidney, and bladder may act as targets to SARS-CoV-2 (9, 15, 16).
    Although there are discrepancies in the reported results of the studies over the SARS CoV-2 urinary
    shedding, since the viral dynamics are yet to be fully determined, it’s been recommended that the urethral
    or ureteral instrumentation and handling should be carried out cautiously (17).
    Determining whether the virus is detectable throughout the disease is critical to control transmission.
    Considering the stability of SARS-CoV-2 for up to 72 hours (18), performing urological surgeries, or
    collecting infected urinary samples may put urologists and health care workers at risk (19). The Ebola
    virus epidemic (2014 to 2015) was an awakening alarm for the health care community regarding the lack
    of biosafety in the handling of samples containing suspected special pathogens (20). This is true,
    particularly when responding to a not well-known pathogen, as the recommendations are often fluid (21).
    Learning about the infectivity also can alter preventative measures in the operating room and the settings
    needed for safety on laboratory practices (22).
    Furthermore, the probability of transmission by pets (23) (24), leaves urine with a large potential to be a
    source of disease spread (25, 26). Although no data are available to confirm or exclude the possibility of
    such transmission, CDC advises restricting contact with pets and other animals while one has COVID-19
    (27).
    By this review, we systematically investigated the findings on the urinary SARS-Cov-2 to points out the
    important methodological considerations needed to be considered in future studies.

    Methods and materials
    The protocol for this systematic review was registered with the International Prospective Register of
    Systematic Reviews (CRD42020187294). The review follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items
    for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis) statement (28).
    Literature Search Strategies
    A systematic search of the literature was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane
    library, and COVID-19 research articles downloadable database of CDC (Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention). The comprehensive literature was performed in June 2020. No language restrictions were
    applied. Articles published in 2019 and 2020 were included. Searches were repeated until the final
    drafting of the manuscript, to capture emerging evidence from the ongoing studies. The searches included
    medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords for SARS-CoV-2, COVID, Corona, together with
    shedding, persistence, urine, urinary, specimen, viral load, or RNA body fluids. Searches were designed
    to be broad and comprehensive initially, using the following keywords and MeSH terms: (“specimen” or
    “urine” or “urinary”) and (“corona” or “coronavirus” or “COVID” or “COVID-19” or “COVID-2019” or
    “SARS” or “SARS-CoV” or “SARS-CoV-2”).
    Eligibility criteria and study selection
    Study selection was based on predefined eligibility criteria within a CoCoPop (Condition, Context,
    Population) and a PIRD (Population, Index Test, Reference test, Diagnosis of Interest) format (Table 1)
    (29). Additional exclusion criteria were applied at the full-text stage. After finalizing the selection of
    studies on the urinary SARS-CoV-2, information on viral existence in stool and blood specimens were
    explored in the selected studies (Figure 1).

    retrospective, prospective observational, case series, and cross-sectional studies were included as well as
    supplementary or non-peer-reviewed reports, correspondence, research letters, and preprints. Review
    articles, case reports, or non-relevant articles were excluded from the pool. Following reviewing and
    extraction of data, references of each manuscript were searched for relevant missing manuscripts.
    Data Extraction
              We created standardized forms for data extraction and the pilot tested the forms before the
    process of data extraction. We completed the data abstraction process using created forms to record study
    characteristics, clinical data, and laboratory data including study year and design, country of study origin,
    total initial population size, test type for disease diagnosis, test type for samples (urine/stool/rectal
    swab/blood), patients age (including mean and range), number of positive and total patients and/or
    (wherever applicable) number of positive and total specimens collected for each test category, disease
    severity, ICU admission, and fatality rate. More details for study items are shown in Table 2.

    Risk of Bias Assessment and Strength of Body of Evidence
              Two investigators assessed the risk of bias for individual studies independently using JBI's
    (Joanna Briggs) critical appraisal tools for prevalence study and diagnostic test accuracy studies to assess
    the trustworthiness, and results of the studies (30-32).
    Statistical Analysis
              Forest plots were used to assess risk ratio (RR) and summarized them to describe RR of viral
    shedding rates in the urine and control groups (i.e., nasopharynx, stool, blood). Primary, secondary, and
    tertiary meta-analysis was conducted among all studies that reported urine and nasopharynx positive rates,
    urine, and stool positive rates, urine, and serum positive rates as an outcome, respectively. The
    heterogeneity across studies was evaluated using p-values, and Q and I2 statistics. Random effect and
    fixed effect meta-analysis were used when the heterogeneity was greater and lower than 50%,
                                                                        5

    respectively. P-values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were carried
    out using Stata version 14.
    Results
    A total of 30 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review (8-13, 17, 35-49). The
    overall prevalence of urinary SARS-CoV-2 shedding was 8%. This was 21.3% and 39.5 % for blood and
    stool respectively.

    Figure 2: Flow chart diagram comparing studies in terms of urine, serum, and stool specimens
    I. Primary Study Population: A total number of 1,271 COVID-19 patients were enrolled initially in the
    studies. The confirmatory testing was positive pharyngeal swabs, except two studies that included four
    patients with initially negative pharyngeal but positive stool results (13, 40). Essentially, all studies
    included patients with a median age between 40s and 60s (ranged from 6 months to 92 years).
    II. Ultimate Urinary Tested Population: Of 746 patients, 439 had undergone urinary testing. In three
    studies, the number of urinary tests patients were not available, instead, the total number of laboratory
    samples (119 samples in total) was reported (Diagram 2).
    III. Stool/rectal Swab and Blood Sampling: Of 30 studies with urinary sampling for viral shedding, 21
    studies performed fecal/rectal swab testing and 22 studies accomplished blood viral testing.
     Laboratory Methods to Identify SARS CoV-19 in the Literature
              Within the literature examined, the most commonly used assays for detection of SARS- CoV-2 in
    different samples such as urine, stool, blood, and pharyngeal swabs were RNA extraction followed by
    semi-quantitative and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (real-time
    RT-PCR, or rRT-PCR). In some studies, serological and molecular methods such as enzyme-linked
    immunosorbent assay (ELISA), partial and whole-genome sequencing were used for more verification.
    Several specific primers pairs were used to amplification of gene regions including RdRp/helicase, spike,
    and nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV-2. Such data were not available for all papers.

    The COVID-19 severity and ICU admission rates are detailed in Table 4.
    • 20.1% of the total initial population were admitted into the ICU, as reported in 13 studies.
    • 33.0% of the total initial population had severe respiratory disease because of SARS-CoV-2, as reported
    in 16 studies.
    • There was no information about the severity or ICU admission in the rest of the studies. Four studies
    that included the cases terminated by death reported a total fatality rate of 7.6% (11/144). The other 11
    studies only enrolled survived cases. Related information was not provided in 15 studies.

    Meta-analysis:
    Meta-analysis was performed across the urinary studies. The summarized RR of 30 retrospective studies
    that reported urine compared to nasopharynx positive rates, was 0.08 (95% confidence intervals (CI);
    0.05-0.16). The pertaining RR urine compared to blood and stool positive rates were 0.20 (95% CI; 0.14-
    0.29) and 0.33 (95% CI; 0.15-0.72) respectively. The forest plots of the meta-analysis are shown in
    Figures 3-5. There was no significant heterogeneity across all studies that included in the all meta-
    analysis, therefore fixed-effect analyses have been used.

    Discussion
    According to our three meta-analyses, stool and blood tests are associated with a significantly higher
    positive rate than urine (Figures 1-3). These results indicated that when the naso-/oro-pharyngeal SARS-
    CoV-2 test is negative, stool, and/or blood tests are more helpful for virus diagnosis than urine.
    Nevertheless, different factors such as the nature of viruses, missing data, design flaws, or methodological
    limitations might have contributed to these findings. The importance of urinary viral infection should not
    be ignored in terms of protective measures. We reviewed some important factors that can influence the
    results.
    Association Between Severity, Fatality, ICU admission rate, and Sepsis, with Urinary Positivity:
    COVID severity can be evidenced by the needs for mechanical ventilation, ICU care, as well as higher
    fatality. Viremia and sepsis are usually representative of more severe forms of diseases and a potential
    source for viral urinary shedding.
    In SARS-CoV-1, viremia was reported to be associated with disease severity (61). Similarly, severely ill
    patients in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 disease may have augmented and prolonged the existence of the
                                                                       12

    virus in blood and other body fluids (10). Furthermore, urinary viral positivity was found in severe cases
    in a study (7). SARS-CoV-2 viremia also may occur in patients with underlying comorbidities (62).
    Moreover, the duration of viral RNA excretion in respiratory and stool specimens may be longer in the
    cases treated with glucocorticoid, an immunosuppressive medication (8, 10). Accordingly, we emphasize
    the importance of inclusion of severely ill patients and ones with an underlying disease in the shedding
    studies.
    In a study with a comparatively higher rate of urinary shedding (9.5%), a significantly higher proportion
    of the population had severe disease (40%) along with a case fatality of 6% (9). In another study, the
    duration of the existence of the virus in the blood of ICU patients was longer. The authors suggested its
    relationship with blood viral load and disease severity. Viruses were not found in the urine samples.
    Although their classification based on ICU admission was informative, the study didn’t have any
    information on whether the cases who ended in death -which might bear a higher urinary positive rate-
    hadn’t been excluded from the study (63). Similarly, some other studies with totally negative urinary
    results were limited to the populations with mild or moderate severity with null fatality (64, 65).
    According to figure 2, the incidence risk of viral shedding in stool or blood was similar for both groups of
    studies with and without positive results. While trying to justify why a study has positive urinary results
    but another study doesn’t, the mentioned finding might not be in favor of the hypothesis that it could have
    arisen from systematic flaws in or in inclusion or exclusion criteria, sampling, or handling methods.
    Nevertheless, a lack of concordance between the severity of disease and ICU admission rates in two
    groups in table 2 indicates heterogeneity of study populations among the studies.
    As a result, since the difference in the severity of COVID-19 may contribute to the urinary negative
    results, we suggest to consider it while planning the study.
    Testing Frequency, Phases of the Disease, and Association with Urinary Results:
    Determining when the virus is detectable in the urine, is not simple. Different phases of the disease may
    lead to considerable differences in viral loads and peak concentrations and can be another factor
    responsible for different urinary findings. Toward the end of the period of the COVID disease, the virus is
    shown to be only intermittently detectable in pharyngeal swabs (41). Since the pharyngeal samples have
    much higher positive rates, finding a virus in the other fluid types could be more challenging.
    As reported in SARS-CoV-1 studies, the urinary positivity rate was up to 42% at the end of the second
    week (5) with a peak occurring at weeks 3–4 and even shedding in the convalescent phase (66, 67).
    Similarly, for SARS-CoV-2, positive urine samples were detected at the latest available detection point
    (16 or 21 days after illness onset) (7).
     Another study with a urinary positivity rate of 6.9% for viral RNA, revealed urine could stay positive
    after the throat swabs turned negative (8).
    Although regular serial sampling was performed for pharyngeal specimens in some of the studies in our
    review, that was not the case for urine. Since repeat urinary testing is warranted especially in clinically
    suspected cases with an initially negative urinary result, we would emphasize the importance of
    systematic serial sample monitoring, throughout the disease phases, with an increased number of tested
    samples.
    Improper Exclusions, underpowered Sample size, and Bias in Urinary Results:
    Failure to find urinary viruses in many studies may be explained by their undersized study population.
    This may contribute to the positivity of urinary results found in studies done in China which were larger
    in population. Our review demonstrated that a considerable number of studies with a larger population
    were able to find positive urinary results (10, 34, 36, 53, 60, 68).
    Moreover, there was a considerable difference in number between the population initially enrolled and
    finally tested for urine. Exclusions were not explained, as in some studies it was found to be more than
    half of the initial population. Except for one study, all the mentioned studies were accompanied by no
    positive urinary results (9, 49, 53, 69).
                                                                       13

    Sample Handling and Laboratory Adjustments:
    Some studies with negative urinary results in this review had no stool positive findings (62, 65, 70), even
    though stool has been proven to have a high possibility of viral shedding (48.1%) (71). This co-negativity
    may also be explained by the errors in handling and laboratory technics.
    Although real-time RT-PCR is considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (72), some
    factors such as the RNA quality, operator variability, or processing methods can affect the test results (73-
    75). Also, this technique does not distinguish between RNA residues and viable active viruses (76). As
    SARS-CoV-2 shares a high nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-1 (82%) (77), using nonspecific real-
    time RT-PCR (e.g. SYBR Green method) may cause false-positive results. Some studies reviewed herein,
    lack information concerning the real-time RT-PCR type, primer, and probe sequences, candidate genes
    for virus detection, presence or absence of positive control, and the cycling parameters for PCR assay.
    Real-time RT-PCR Ct (cycle threshold) values may also differ because of specimen collection or
    handling. The presence of several enzymes such as protease, RNase, or bacteria and the absence of
    proteins that stabilize RNA and virus in the urine may explain the quick degradation of viral RNA (78,
    79). Technical improvement in the sampling to prevent degradation of the urinary viral RNA (such as
    immediate addition of lysis buffer to the fresh urine) may help to increase the diagnostic sensitivity and
    diminish false negative (78, 80). Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of these methods in
    SARS-CoV-2.
              Another source of false-positive urinary results can be passive contamination of urine samples
    with stool or other sources that can occur in severely ill or in the presence of diarrhea. The presence of
    different genotypes in urine or the comparatively higher RNA concentrations in urine would indicate
    active replication in the urine rather than contamination and spillage.
    As can be noticed so far, this review encountered several limitations that resulted from a lack of high-
    quality evidence. We just mentioned the most important topics that help in building researches with a
    deeper focus on the design and methodologic quality in the future and help assess the viral shedding in
    urine and other specimens more efficiently.
    Conclusion
    Based on review of the present literature, shedding of SARS-CoV-2 occurs in around 10 percent of
    population and it may have an association with the severity of systemic disease, need to admission in ICU
    and fatality. Investigating relationship between urine results and other factors is hardly possible without
    avoiding inappropriate exclusions. Furthermore, our review suggests that a larger population size may
    reveal more positive urinary cases. Moreover, using standardized laboratory quantitative control in real-
    time RT-PCR as well as repeat urinary testing would be warranted especially in patients with initially
    negative urinary results.
