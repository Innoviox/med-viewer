    ABSTRACT
    Aim: To estimate time to recovery/convalescence and identify determinants among COVID-19
    infected patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
    Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted among a randomly selected sample of 360
    COVID-19 patients who were on follow up from 2nd June to 5th July 2020. Kaplan Meier plots,
    median survival times, and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival
    distribution between groups. Association between time to recovery/ convalescence and
    determinants was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard survival model, where hazard ratio,
    P-value, and 95% CI for hazard ratio were used for testing significance.
    Results: The mean age of the participants was 32.4 years (± 12.5 years). On admission, 86.9 %
    had mild COVID-19, 78.6% were asymptomatic and 11.4% of the patients had a history of pre-
    existing co-morbid illness. The Median time to recovery/ convalescence among the study
    population was 16 days. The log-rank test shows that having non-mild (moderate and severe)
    disease, having one or more symptoms at presentation, and presenting with respiratory and
    constitutional symptoms seems to extend the time needed to achieve recovery. The Final Cox
    regression result shows that the presence of symptom at presentation was found to be a
    significant factor that affects time to recovery/ convalescence, the rate of achieving recovery/
    convalescence among symptomatic patients was 44% lower than patients who were
    asymptomatic at presentation (HR= 0.560, 95% CI= 0.322-0.975, p-value=0.040).
    Conclusions: Presence of symptom was found to be associated with delayed viral clearance.
    This implies symptomatic patients are more likely to be infectious because of the prolonged viral
    shedding in addition to the presence of a more concentrated virus in the upper respiratory tract
    that enhances the transmission. Therefore, attention should be given in the isolation and
    treatment practice of COVID-19 patients with regard to presence of symptom.

    Key Messages
      •    The study assessed the time to RT-PCR proven recovery (two consecutive negative viral
           shedding) and identified determinants that affected the time.
      •    Symptomatic infection is associated with delayed viral clearance.
      •    The finding of the study could be used to guide the isolation and treatment practice.
    INTRODUCTION
    Currently, the world is facing a global pandemic with a new coronavirus SARS-CoV- 2 (Severe
    Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus Type 2) causing an infectious disease named
    COVID-19 (Corona Virus Infectious Disease 2019). The infection primarily targets the human
    respiratory system and is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets and close contact with an
    infected person 1.
    As per the WHO daily situation report, the total cases of COVID-19 are increasing worldwide
    including the African region which got hit by the pandemic a little later. As of August 5, 2020,
                                                                                                                                       2

    globally there were 18,354,342 confirmed cases and 696,147 deaths because of COVID-19
    infection 2.
    In Ethiopia since the first case of COVID-19 confirmed on March 13, 2020, there were a total of
    19,875 confirmed cases and 343 deaths as of August 5, 2020. Most of the cases are from Addis
    Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. At the beginning, most of them were imported cases from
    overseas travelers. Eventually, the transmission dynamics shifted to mainly contact with a
    confirmed case and then to cases with no identifiable contact or travel history. As per WHO
    daily situation report, currently the transmission is classified as community transmission 2.
    Initially, little was known about the disease. As research continues, knowledge about the clinical,
    epidemiologic, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics of the disease is building up. The
    presenting symptoms and the severity of the disease seem to vary from place to place as it varies
    from individual to individual based on sex, age, and other characteristics reflecting the
    contribution of background characteristics of patients to the clinical presentation, severity, and
    outcome of the disease.
    Regarding the spectrum of presenting symptoms, patients may not present with any symptom
    during the entire course of the disease while being infected (asymptomatic cases) or patients
    might present with respiratory and constitutional symptoms which are reported to be the
    commonest presentation in most setups. In addition, atypical presentations like hyposmia,
    hypogeusia, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sputum, cerebrovascular accidents, abdominal pain,
    vomiting, and diarrhea are also reported. These atypical symptoms are reported to be observed in
    the majority of patients in a study conducted in Europe but only in few patients in the United
    states making it difficult to generalize these symptoms as atypical for all setups 3-9.
    The outcome of the disease varies based on individual underlying characteristics and health
    conditions and could be range from uneventful recovery to death10-12.
    Disease severity and death are found to be affected by different factors including older age,
    presence of pre-existing comorbidities, fracture, lack of early improvement in arterial partial
    pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, and abnormal prominent
    laboratory markers 11,13-20. The role of sex in the severity of the disease or outcome is not clear
    yet, one study point that there seems to be no difference in epidemiological characteristics with
    regard to sex, and in another study, it is reported that sex might have impact on the clinical
    presentation and prognosis showing worse prognosis among males 21,22.
    Some studies are conducted around the world that investigates the duration of viral shedding. It
    is reported that the median duration from diagnosis up to negative viral shedding varies from
    place to place and could range from 14 to 48 days and the major determinants identified were
    age, sex, temperature at admission, time from symptom onset to admission, hospital length of
    stay, having symptomatic infection, fever, chest tightness, pneumonia, invasive mechanical
    ventilation and lymphocyte count less than 2.0 × 10⁹/L 23-27.
    To tackle the COVID-19 threat in Ethiopia hospitals and health centers have been equipped with
    the capacity to treat COVID-19 patients and to isolate contacts with confirmed cases. In addition
                                                                                                                                       3

    to this, to accommodate to the growing threat, a 1000 bed Millennium COVID-19 Care Center
    (MCCC) was organized by a makeshift of a previous Millennium hall/ Addis park.
    In Ethiopia, as in most African countries, the number of incident cases, severity of the disease,
    and fatality rate is lower than the rest of the world. But the pattern might not continue like this
    considering the vulnerable nature of the society in the face of the triple burden of diseases;
    communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, and injuries, and challenged health care
    system. Several studies have been conducted around the world, almost all outside Africa, to
    understand the disease pattern and outcome, and evidence point that there is a variation from
    place to place showing that there is still very little well-established knowledge about the disease.
    Also, the underlying population characteristics, economic status, health care structure, and
    endemic disease pattern of our country, and Africa in general, is different from other regions of
    the world making it difficult to predict and generalize findings based on the health care set up of
    other countries.
    That said, understanding the disease course in terms of viral shedding time will assist in
    providing a tailored isolation and treatment practice.
    Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate time to recovery/convalescence and
    identify determinants among COVID-19 infected patients admitted at Millennium COVID-19
    Care Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
    METHODS AND MATERIALS
    Study setting and period
    The study was conducted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center (MCCC), a makeshift hospital
    in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. The center is remodeled from the previous
    Millennium hall/ Addis park which was a multipurpose recreational, meeting, and exhibition
    center. The center has 1000 beds including an ICU with 10 mechanical ventilators.
    Study Design
    The study design was institution based prospective cohort design. The follow up was made from
    2nd June to 5th July, 2020.
    Source and Study Population
    The source population was all patients admitted to MCCC with a confirmed diagnosis of
    COVID-19 using RT-PCR from referral centers and who were on follow up from 2nd June to 5th
    July. During this interval a total of 768 COVID-19 patients were seen at the Center.
    The study population was all selected COVID-19 patients who were on treatment and follow up
    at MCCC from 2nd June to 5th July, 2020 and who full fill the inclusion criteria.
    Sample Size Determination and Sampling Technique
    The sample size was determined by using sample size calculation formula of the survival method
    by considering the following statistical assumptions: 95% Confidence Interval (CI), power of
                                                                                                                                       4

    90%, survival probability of 0.5, 5% marginal error, 10% non-response rate and with finite
    population correction. The final sample size estimated for this study was 366.
    To select the study participants, simple random sampling method using table of random numbers
    was employed.
    Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
    All selected COVID-19 patients who were on treatment and follow up at the MCCC from 2nd
    June to 5th July, 2020 were included.
    Operational Definitions
    COVID-19 patient: any patient who tested positive for COVID-19 antigen as reported by a
    laboratory given mandate to test such patients by the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health 28.
    Asymptomatic patient: any patient who tested positive for COVID-19 but does not have any
    symptoms. These patients are detected after isolation and contact tracing as done by the
    Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) 28.
    COVID-19 severity score: was determined based on the WHO classification as follows 29.
         -    Mild Disease: Characterized by fever, malaise, cough, upper respiratory symptoms,
              and/or less common features of COVID-19 (headache, loss of taste or smell etc.)
         -    Moderate Disease: Patients with lower respiratory symptom/s. They may have infiltrates
              on chest X-ray. These patients are able to maintain oxygenation on room air.
         -    Severe Disease: These patients have developed complications. The following features
              can define severe illness.
              o Hypoxia: SPO2 ≤ 93% on atmospheric air or PaO2:FiO2 < 300mmHg (SF ratio <
                   315)
              o Tachypnea: in respiratory distress or RR>30 breaths/minutes
              o More than 50% involvement seen on chest imaging
    Recovery/ convalescence: Recovery/ convalescence from Covid-19 infection as evidenced by
    two negative RT-PCR test done at least 24 hours apart.
    Event: Achieving recovery/ convalescence from Covid-19 infection.
    Censoring: Represents patients lost to follow-up, transferred out, died or completed the follow-
    up period without achieving the event.
    Time to event or censoring: Time between date of laboratory sample taken which confirmed
    Covid-19 infection to recovery/ convalescence from Covid-19 infection or censoring (in days).
                                                                                                                                       5

    Patient and public involvement
    Patients or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination
    plans of our research.
    Data Collection Procedures and Quality Assurance
    An interviewer administered questionnaire that consists of the variables of interest was
    developed from the patient registration and follow up form and used to collect the necessary data
    from the patients and their medical charts.
    The data collection tool was pretested on 5% of randomly selected patients and their medical
    charts and necessary amendment on the data collection tool was made.
    Training on the basics of the questionnaire and data collection tool was given for ten data
    collectors (BSc nurses and General practitioners) and two supervisors (General practitioner and
    public health specialist) for one day.
    Data consistency and completeness was checked before an attempt was made to enter the code
    and analyze the data.
    Data Management and Data Analysis
    The collected data was coded and entered into Epi-Info version 7.2.1.0, cleaned and stored and
    exported into SPSS version 23 for analysis. Frequency tables, Kaplan Meier (KM) plots and
    median survival times were used to describe the data. Survival experience of different groups
    was compared using KM survival curves andLog-rank tests. Association between time to
    recovery/ convalescence and determinants was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard
    survival model, where hazard ratio, P-value and 95% CI for hazard ratio were used for testing
    significance and interpretation of results.
    Univariate analysis was performed to calculate an unadjusted hazard ratio (UHR) and to screen
    out potentially significant independent variables at 25% level of significance. Association
    between the most relevant independent variables and the time to recovery/ convalescence from
    COVID-19 infection was assessedusing multivariable Cox proportional hazard survival model.
    Adjusted HR, P-value and 95% CI for HR were used to test significance and interpretation of
    results. Variables with p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered as statistically associated with time to
    recovery/ convalescence from COVID-19 infection in days. The basic assumptions of Cox
    Proportional Hazard model was tested using log- minus- log function.
    RESULT
    Censoring status and median time to recovery
    Information was obtained from 360 COVID-19 patients among the 366 samples selected, making
    the response rate 98.4%.
    Among the 360 patients, 132 (36.7%) of the patients achieved recovery/ convalescence while
    228 (63.3%) were censored.
                                                                                                                                       6

    The median time to recovery/ convalescence was 16 days and it ranges from 7 to 21 days.
    Socio–demographic and pregnancy related variables and censoring status
    The mean age of the participants was 32.4 years (± 12.5 years). The minimum and the maximum
    age of the patients were 1 and 75 years respectively. Majority of the patients (55.8 %) were
    males and the rest (44.2 %) were females and 337 of the patients (93.6 %) were from Addis
    Ababa. Only 11 (3.1%) of the patients were health care professionals. There were three pregnant
    women, two at first trimester and one at third trimester.
    The proportion of patients who achieved recovery among males (39.8%) was higher than females
    (32.7%). Higher proportion of patients from outside Addis Ababa (52.2%) achieved recovery
    compared with patients from Addis Ababa (35.6%). Majority of the health care professionals
    (90.9%) and all the three pregnant were censored. (Table 1)
    Contact history, pre-existing history of Co-morbid illness, substance use and medication
    intake history related variables and censoring status
    Close to two third of the patients (70.8%) acquired the disease through community transmission
    and the rest (29.2%) were through a known contact or travel history. Forty one (11.4%) of the
    patients had a history of pre-existing co-morbid illness. The commonest co-morbid illness
    history was hypertension (5%) followed by type 2 diabetes mellitus (2.2%), HIV (1.9%),
    bronchial asthma (1.1%), seizure disorder (0.6%), chronic liver disease (0.3%) and tuberculosis
    (0.3%). Five of the patients (1.4%) had a history of substance use including cigarette and shisha
    smoking and khat chewing. Regarding drug used within 14 days of admission, ACEIs, ARBs and
    NSAIDs use were reported by one (0.3%), one (0.3%) and five (1.4%) of the patients,
    respectively.
    The proportion of patients who achieved recovery was higher among those who contracted the
    disease through community transmission (39.6%) and those with no pre-existing co-morbid
    illness (37.9%) compared with those who contracted the disease through non-community
    transmission (29.5%) and those with pre-existing co-morbid illness (26.8%), respectively. All the
    six patients who have a history of drug intake within 14 days of admission were censored.
    (Table 1)
    Presenting symptom and COVID-19 severity related variables and censoring status
    More than two third (78.6%) of the patients were asymptomatic at presentation and the rest
    (21.4%) were symptomatic. The commonest presenting symptom was respiratory symptoms
    (18.3 %) followed by constitutional (12.8%), Gastrointestinal (1.9%) and neurologic (0.8%)
    symptoms. Majority of the patients (86.9 %) had mild COVID-19 severity score at admission
    and the rest had moderate (12.2%) and severe (0.8%) disease at presentation.
    The proportion of patients who achieved recovery was higher among those with no presenting
    symptom at admission (40.6%) than those with one or more symptom at admission (22.1%).
    The proportion of patients who achieved recovery was higher among those who did not have
    respiratory (40.5%) and constitutional (38.9%) symptoms compared with those who presented
    with respiratory (19.7%) and constitutional (21.7%) symptoms. On the other hand, higher
    proportion of patients with neurologic (66.7%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (42.9%) has
                                                                                                                                       7

    achieved recovery compared with those with no neurologic (36.4%) and gastrointestinal (36.5%)
    symptoms at presentation. A greater proportion (39.0%) of patients with mild COVID-19
    severity score has achieved recovery compared with the moderate cases (22.7%). All the three
    severe cases were censored. (Table 1)

    Comparison of survival experience
    A log rank test was used to assess difference in the survival distribution among groups.
    Accordingly, the survival time was significantly different among the different groups in COVID-
    19 severity score, presence of symptom, respiratory and constitutional symptoms (p-values <
    0.05). Having non mild (moderate and severe) disease and having one or more symptom at
    presentation seems to extend the time needed to achieve recovery. The time needed to achieve
    recovery was longer among patients with non mild disease (19.3 days) compared with those with
    mild disease (17.9 days) (X2(1)= 7.841, P-value= 0.005). The survival time showed that those
    patients who presented with one or more symptom achieved recovery in a relatively longer time
    (19.2 days) than those who had no symptom at presentation (17.8 days). As shown in Figure 1
    the KM survival function graph also showed that those with mild disease and those with no
    symptom at presentation had a favorable survival (time to achievement of recovery/
    convalescence) experience. The right panel of the figures shows that, the instantaneous chance of
    achieving recovery increases for both COVID-19 severity groups and presenting symptom
    groups as the duration of treatment increases.

    by time
    Similarly, the time needed to achieve recovery seemed longer among patients who presented
    with respiratory symptom (19.3 days) and constitutional symptom (19.4 days) compared with
    those who didn’t have respiratory symptom (17.9 days) and those who didn’t have constitutional
    symptom (17.9 days), respectively.
    On the other hand, the survival time did not show statistically significant difference among the
    different groups classified by sex, place of residence, health care worker, how patient contracted
    the disease and pre-existing co-morbid illness (all p-values >0.05). (Table 2)

    Results of Multivariable Cox Proportional Hazard Model
    The fundamental assumption of Cox Proportional Hazard model, which is proportional hazards
    assumption, was tested using Log-minus-Log function. Parallel lines between groups indicate
    proportionality 30. Figures 2 reveals that the survival curves seem parallel throughout the study
    time. These plots show reasonable fit to the proportional hazard assumption.

    Figure 2: Log minus Log function for presence of symptom and COVID-19 severity score
    Based on the result of the Univariate analysis at 25% level of significance and the significant
    variables identified from literatures, the following variables were included in the final regression
    model; age, sex, pre-existing co-morbid illness/s, presence of symptom and COVID-19 severity.
    Presence of symptom at presentation was found to be significantly associated with time to
    recovery/ convalescence in the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model at 5% level of
    significance. Accordingly, after adjusting for other covariates, the rate of achieving recovery/
    convalescence among symptomatic patients was 44% lower than patients who were
    asymptomatic at presentation (HR= 0.560, 95% CI= 0.322-0.975, p-value=0.040). This implies
    that the time needed to reach to recovery among symptomatic patients was significantly longer
    compared with asymptomatic patients. (Table 3)

    DISCUSSION
    In this study, we assessed the determinants of time to convalescence among COVID-19 patients
    who were admitted at MCCC. The log-rank test shows that having non-mild (moderate and
    severe) disease, having one or more symptom at presentation, and presenting with respiratory
    and constitutional symptoms seems to extend the time needed to achieve recovery. This implies
    that having a more severe disease category and developing symptomatic disease are associated
    with delayed biochemical recovery from the disease and extended infectiousness period which
    puts close contact at risk.
    The median time to recovery/ convalescence was 16 days. There is no a set standard or target
    that is set to be used as a reference internationally or nationally. This finding is comparable with
    results from other studies that reported a median duration of 14, 15, and 17 days in different
    countries and different age groups23-26.
    According to the Cox proportional hazard regression model, the presence of symptom at
    presentation was found to be a significant factor that determines the time to recovery/
    convalescence.
    The rate of achieving recovery/ convalescence among symptomatic patients was 44% lower than
    patients who were asymptomatic after being adjusted for other variables. This means
    symptomatic patients showed a relatively delayed viral clearance compared to asymptomatic
    patients. This could be because most of the symptomatic patients in the current study had
    respiratory tract symptoms that could have increased the likelihood of detecting the virus in the
    upper respiratory tract sample. This finding is also in accordance with a study conducted in
    Wuhan where having symptom was found to be a significant predictor of duration of viral
    shedding, with a prolonged viral shedding among patients who present with symptomatic
    infection26.
    On the other hand, factors that are identified to be significant determinants of convalescence like
    age, sex, presence of co-morbid illness, and disease severity didn’t show any significant
    association with time to convalescence.
    In this study, the majority of the participants (63.3%) were censored due to referral to other
    centers, and due to the relatively short study period. The upper limit of the observation period is
    chosen because of the change in the patient discharge criteria which focused on a clinical
                                                                                                                                     13

    decision in addition to the RT-PCR result per se which made us unable to get two consecutive
    negative RT-PCR results for each patient. This might have reflected on the median time
    obtained. Therefore, the result has to be interpreted with this limitation in mind.
    CONCLUSION
    The median time to recovery/ convalescence among COVID-19 patients admitted at Millennium
    COVID-19 Care Center was found to be 16 days. The presence of symptoms was found to be
    associated with delayed viral clearance. This implies that symptomatic patients are more likely to
    be infectious because of the prolonged viral shedding in addition to the presence of a more
    concentrated virus in the upper respiratory tract that enhances the transmission. Therefore,
    attention should be given in the isolation and treatment practice of COIVD-19 patients with
    regard to the presence of symptom. Furthermore, to guide the local practice with better evidence,
    further multicenter study with prolonged observation is recommended.
