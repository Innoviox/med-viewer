               While the COVID-19 outbreak is making an impact at a global scale, the

               collective response to the pandemic becomes the key to analyzing past situ-

               ations, evaluating current measures, and formulating future predictions. In

               this paper, we analyze the public reactions to the pandemic using search en-

               gine data and mobility data from Baidu Search and Baidu Maps respectively,

               where we particularly pay attentions to the early stage of pandemics and find

               early signals from the collective response to COVID-19. First, we correlate the
               number of confirmed cases per day to daily search queries of a large number

               of keywords through Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Detrended Cross-

               Correlation Analysis (DCCA), where the keywords top in the most critical
               days are believed the most relevant to the pandemic. We then categorize the

               ranking lists of keywords according to the specific regions of the search, such

               as Wuhan, Mainland China, the USA, and the whole world. Through the anal-
               ysis on search, we succeed in identifying COVID-19 related collective response

                                                                         1

              would not be earlier than the end of 2019 in Mainland China. Finally, we
              confirm this observation again using human mobility data, where we specifi-

              cally compare the massive mobility traces, including the real-time population
              densities inside key hospitals and inter-city travels departing from/arriving in
              Wuhan, from 2018 to 2020. No significant changes have been witnessed before

              December, 2019.


      Introduction

      As reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), a global pandemic, COVID-19, has

      rapidly spread all over the world since December, 2019, e.g., within China (1), the United

      States (2), European countries (3), etc. The COVID-19 pandemic is considered as the great-

      est challenge for humankind since World War II (4). The outbreak of COVID-19 has been

      closely monitored by governments, researchers, and digital tracing applications (5, 6). As early

      as January 2, 2020 research (7) has confirmed Huanan seafood market in Wuhan was epidemio-

      logically associated with most (27 of 44) of the patients from Mainland China, the starting point

      of the collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic however remains unclear (8).

           To analyze the collective response to COVID-19, digital information turns out to be critical,

      efficient, and effective (6). For example, mobile phone applications (Apps) can be easily used
      to conduct contact tracing and notification upon case confirmation (6). With data collected from

      the mobile phone Apps, statistical analysis has been carried out for COVID-19-related studies
      (9–11), e.g., Baidu Migration (12). Further, search engines, e.g., Baidu (13), has been used to
      understand social responses to the pandemic from the keywords of massive search queries while

      making users well-informed during the outbreak of COVID-19. In addition, mobility data from
      Baidu Maps also demonstrates the collective response from the perspective of mobility (14,15),
      where we can compare the massive mobility traces under the pandemic with the regular patterns

                                                                     2

      in past years, so as to sketch how populations move as a response to COVID-19. In summary,
      please refer to studies (16–27) for analyzing the collective response to COVID-19 with digital

      information.
           In this work, we focus on the analysis of the collective response in the early stage of the
      pandemic using both search data and mobility data. Specifically, we exploit the search index

      data from Baidu search index and mobility traces from Baidu Maps, where we intend to explore
      the potential abnormal changes of collective behaviors in the second half of 2019. To achieve the

      goal, with the search index data, we sort candidate keywords based on the correlation between

      the search volume of the keyword and the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, using

      two methods, i.e., Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) (28, 29) and Detrended Cross-Correlation

      Analysis method (DCCA) (30). Then, we perform the correlation analysis from 2014 to 2020

      between any two of the four regions, i.e., Wuhan, Mainland China, the United States (US),

      and the whole world, using DCCA. From the correlation, we try to identify abnormal changes

      and analyze the corresponding search volume and keywords, where we have not found any

      abnormal change before December, 2019 compared to previous years. With mobility data from

      Baidu Maps, we analyze the trend of population mobility from 2018 to 2020. We normalize

      the population inflow and outflow from June, 2018 to March, 2020, and we analyze the inflow

      and outflow separately on an annual time scale, where we try to identify the starting point of
      the collective response to the pandemic and observe how population flows change before and
      after the outbreak of COVID-19. Our analysis using search data and mobility data reveals that

      the collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic started from December, 2019 in Mainland
      China.
           Compared with the existing work (14, 31, 32), we aim at tracing back the starting point

      of COVID-19 and observing the collective response in such a critical moment through time-
      series analysis on search data and mobility data analysis with massive mobility traces. In terms


                                                                     3

      of determining the starting moment of COVID-19, (9–11) infer the possible origin dates of
      COVID-19 using dynamical systems and the numbers of cases confirmed over time. Compared

      to these studies, our work revisits the early stage of the pandemic from the perspective col-
      lective response, using search data and mobility data collected from massive mobile users in a
      participatory fashion. To uncover the latent factors of epidemiological dynamics, (7, 16–26) fit

      parameterized models with the numbers of cases confirmed over time, and interpret the models
      through the physical and epidemiological meaning of every parameter. Compared to these stud-

      ies, our work does not make any assumptions on the epidemiological dynamics while providing

      a model-free analysis on the search and mobility data. Instead, we simply track the collective

      response through ranking the frequent search keywords and detecting the changes in population

      inflow/outflow between Chinese cities, in a data-driven fashion. Finally, this work incorporates

      direct evidences through multi-modal data fusion, while existing studies (33) rely on inferences

      and predictions based on indirect measurements. For example, (33) estimated and compared the

      volumes of visits to hospitals in Wuhan in 2018 and 2019 using remote sensing data from satel-

      lites, then claimed abnormalities detected. We directly sample the volumes of visits to hospitals

      in Wuhan from 2018 to 2020 through tracking the massive mobility traces collected from Baidu

      Maps, and confirm that there was no abnormality of hospital visit volumes before December,

      2019 in Wuhan.


      Search Index Analysis

      Using search index data, we analyze correlations between the frequent search keywords, related
      to respiratory diseases, per day and the trends of confirmed cases using DTW and DCCA.

      Specifically, we first analyze the long-term search data from March, 2014 to March, 2020, in
      four regions, i.e., Wuhan (Baidu Search Index), Mainland China (Baidu Search Index), the US
      (Google Trends) and the world (Google Trends), where we observe the spike of search trends

                                                                     4

      with keywords related to respiratory diseases during the outbreak. Afterwards, we present the
      analysis on the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from March, 2020 to July, 2020, in

      Beijing., where we observe consistent patterns appeared in the collective response of the first
      wave.

      Correlation Analysis based on DTW and DCCA

      We collected three datasets: the first dataset contains 47 COVID-19-related keywords; the sec-

      ond dataset includes the search index (2014 - 2020) from Baidu search index for Wuhan and

      Mainland China, and Google Trends for the US and the whole world; the third dataset consists

      of the number of confirmed cases per day from COVID-19 statistics (34).

           As both search index data and the number of confirmed cases are time-series data, i.e.,

      each data item associated with a time stamp, we use DTW and DCCA as analytical tools.

      DTW is introduced to adjust the time stamps and to match sequences that are similar but out of

      phase (35). DCCA is based on detrended covariance to investigate power-law cross-correlations

      between different simultaneously recorded time-series (30). Both DTW and DCCA can analyze

      the time-series data. For every keyword, we estimate the correlation using DTW and DCCA

      between the everyday search index of the keyword and the number of confirmed cases per day
      during the pandemic, where we believe the top keywords with highest correlations refer to the

      most relevant evidences and the correlations estimated by DTW and DCCA confirm each other.

      We rank the keywords in four regions, i.e., Wuhan, Mainland China, the US, and the world,
      separately, where the common top five keywords are:

           • “Covid,” “epidemic situation,” “mask,” “pneumonia,” and “sterilization” (based on DTW);

           • “Covid,” “epidemic situation,” “mask,” “sterilization,” and ‘nucleic acid” (based on DCCA).

      In addition, we find that COVID-19 relative symptoms (33), such as “diarrhea” (16th ) and


                                                                     5

      “cough” (20th ), are included within the top keywords
           To analyze the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, we study the correlation of the search

      index of the high-ranked keywords between any two of the four regions (Wuhan, China, the
      US, and the world), using DCCA for each year between 2014 and 2020. We take “mask,” as an
      example, as “mask” is high-ranked in all the four regions.

           From the analysis, we can see that there is no significant change in the correlation among
      the four regions before December, 2019. The correlation patterns between Wuhan and China,

      and between the US and the world, are consistently significant. By the end of 2019, the search

      index shows that the search volumes in the US or all over the world spiked faster than those in

      Wuhan or China. It is since the end of 2019, or more particularly, since 2020, that the COVID-

      19-related search volumes have increased significantly, reaching peaks in January or February

      in Wuhan and China. The search index of the keywords also reveals that the early stage of the

      collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic began from the end of 2019, i.e., December of

      2019.

                                 Figure 1: Analysis of search index from 2014 to 2020.

           From Figure 1a, we can see that the correlations among the four regions were consistently

      positive and did not change much between 2014 and 2019, except in 2015, where positive

      correlations suggest the synchronizing trends of search keywords in global-wise. However,

                                                                     6

      the correlations between Wuhan and the world, Wuhan and the US, the world and China, and
      the US and China have significantly changed and have dropped to negative in 2020, while the

      overall trends of search index dramatically increased in the same time, compared with other
      years. It demonstrates the happening of massive events (i.e., COVID-19) which changes the
      common trends of search at global scale. Interestingly, prior to COVID-19, we found a short

      term in 2015 with negative correlations between Wuhan and the world, Wuhan and the US, the
      world and China, and the US and China. In that year, an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory

      Syndrome (MERS) was found in Korea (36) and influenced several Asian countries. Similar

      patterns repeat in the status quo of 2020.

           From search volumes shown in Figure 1b, we find that the search volumes in Wuhan or

      China before November, 2019 were still relatively lower than those in the US or the world.

      This result indicates that there was no special mask-related epidemic in Wuhan or China before

      November, 2019. In addition, we also find that the search volume of “mask” increased from

      December, 2019 and reached its peak in January, 2020 in Wuhan and China.

      Search Data Analysis of the Second Wave in Beijing

      After great efforts were put into inhibiting the spread of COVID-19, the pandemic was mostly

      under control in China after May, 2020. However, on June 11th, the first case related to Xinfadi
      Market in Beijing was found, which led to a second wave of pandemic in Beijing. This sec-

      ond wave of epidemic persisted for more than a month, and was contained around the end of
      July. With previous experience in tackling COVID-19, this second wave was met with a swift
      response, not only in news reportage but also in measure implementation. We investigate how

      the public reacted to this resurgence of COVID-19 throughout this entire period by searching
      frequencies of keywords, and find that Beijing’s case is consistent with the previous national
      scenario.


                                                                     7

        Figure 2: Search index of "nucleic acid" in Beijing from March 1st, 2020 to July 20th, 2020

           From the analysis, we can see that the general public in Beijing exhibited a high level of at-

      tention to the overall event as the search volume of a majority of keywords, e.g., “nucleic acid,”

      “epidemic,” “mask,” “sore throat,” and “fever,” surges significantly following the outbreak on

      June 11th, where the search index of “nucleic acid” shown in Figure 2 is an example. How-

      ever, a few words, e.g., “stuffy nose,” “respiratory failure,” and “respiratory distress,” which are

      mostly related to critically ill patients, did not show a noticeable change in search, which is in

      accordance with the fact that although the outbreak aroused concerns at first, quick containment

      actions prevented the outbreak from resulting in a huge number of significantly ill patients. Un-
      til July, the search trends fell back into the previous levels as normalized in earlier months, since

      the epidemic was fully under control after mid-July.


      Mobility Traces Analysis

      In this section, we try to find abnormal population mobility trends from June, 2018 to March,
      2020, exploring the starting point of the collective response to COVID-19. We exploit the

      mobility data from Baidu Maps, which consists of the inflow and outflow to/from Wuhan, and
      the population densities of multiple hospitals in Wuhan, from June, 2018 to March, 2020.

      Inflow and Outflow Analysis




      Figure 3: The population inflow into Wuhan (2018 - 2020). The inflow of 2019 is between
      January 1st and December 31st. The inflow of 2018 is between June 1st and December 31st,
      which is aligned with that of 2019 using the Solar Calendar. The inflow of 2020 is between
      December 22nd, 2019 to March 31st, 2020, which is aligned with that of 2019 using the Lunar
      Calendar.

           Figures 3 and 4 show the population inflow and outflow in Wuhan, spanning from June,
      2018 to March, 2020, extracted from the mobility traces from Baidu Maps. Each point of data
      representing inflow refers to the number of people who entered into the city on that specific

      date, and correspondingly, each outflow data point refers to the number of people who left the
      city on that date. We separate inflow and outflow into distinct diagrams in order to demonstrate
      a sharper focus on time scale comparison. In addition, all absolute values of the mobility data

      different times. For a few dates with missing data, we utilize the data from a previous date as

      an estimation.

      Analysis of Inflow

      As shown in Figure 3, we find that the collective mobility related response to the pandemic
      has happened around January 24th (Spring Festival), 2020. For inflow data shown in Figure

      3, we align inflow traces from January 1st, 2018 to December 31st, 2018 along with January

      1st, 2019. We obtain data starting from June 1st, 2018, and thus the green line representing

      the inflow of 2018 started from the second half of the figure. As we can see from the figure,

      these two lines of 2018 and 2019 exhibit a high level of superposition, especially similar pattern

      trends in corresponding time spots for peaks and troughs. The peaks that happened around June

      9th, September 15th, and October 6th were mainly due to Chinese national holidays, including

      the Dragon Boat Festival, the Mid-Autumn Festival, and National Day, where people flooded

      in for family gatherings, travel, or other leisure purposes. The 2018 line displays a stable trend

      bounded around 0 and 1 throughout the second half of the year, while the line of 2019 shows a

      slight decline in inflow after the National Day holiday, compared to previous parts of the year.
      Yet, the overall trend is steady, without significant stumbling. The line representing inflow of

      2020 contains the inflows from December 22nd, 2019 to March, 2020. Note that in Figure 3, we

      align the yearly traces according to the Lunar Calendar for better comparison. We can see both
      peaks happened around Spring Festival due to the national holidays. It is after Spring Festival

      that we witness a significant decline in inflow approaching a standardized score of -2, as the

      pandemic began and China announced travel restrictions. From the population inflow traces,
      we conclude that there is no obvious abnormal trend before Spring Festival in Wuhan compared

      to previous year’s data, which implies our finding.


                                                                    11

      Analysis of Outflow

      As shown in Figure 4, with the analysis of outflow, we also find that the collective mobility
      related response to the pandemic has happened around Spring Festival. In Figure 4, two lines

      of 2018 and 2019 exhibit a high level of superposition, with peaks around national holidays
      similar to scenarios in inflow diagrams. Zooming in for the latter part of 2019, the outflows
      from October to December maintain a paralleling trend, indicating no aberrant leaving or public

      panic. The increasing slopes of the outflow are similar in 2019 and 2020, as Wuhan is a city

      with abundant migrant workers. Yet, we can see some abnormal humps in the outflow at January

      11th, 2020, where outflow is obviously above the previous year’s level, probably suggesting an

      onset of COVID-19 and more people leaving the city to avoid it. It is after Spring Festival that

      we witness a significant decline in outflow, approaching a standardized score approximating -2,

      implying that the start of the collective response to the pandemic is likely to have happened

      around Spring Festival.

           Finally, the combination of the analysis of inflow and outflow further confirms that the

      collective mobility related response to the pandemic have happened three days before Spring

      Festival, i.e., January 21st, 2020. For speculating a point as a start of the collective response to

      the pandemic, we need to find abnormal trends with high outflow and low inflow. If people were
      aware of abnormal events, people within the city would want to leave and people outside of city

      would not want to enter. Yet, we do not note any significant declining trend in inflow nor rising
      trend in outflow during the second half of the year in 2019. We find an abnormal peak of outflow
      around January 11th, 2020, and a higher increase in outflow than the previous year, peaking

      around January 21st, 2020. Reflected within the data, we also see a highly efficient government
      measure implementation, as both inflow and outflow tumbled after travel restrictions (from/to
      Wuhan) announced on January 23rd, 2020, hitting an unprecedented level of almost -2, and this

      low level persisted afterwards.

                                                                    12

                              Figure 5: Population data of hospitals in Wuhan 2018-2019.

      Analysis of Population in the Hospitals of Wuhan

      Figure 5 shows the normalized total population in 26 hospitals of Wuhan, including Tianyou

      Hospital affiliated to the Wuhan University of Science and Technology mentioned in (33), which

      have accepted COVID-19 patients. Each point of data represents the population index at that
      specific category of locations on each date spanning from June, 2018 to March, 2020, based on

      data from Baidu Maps. All absolute values of the mobility data were normalized to shed light

      on a more structured inference on time scale comparison. For days that we miss, we use data
      from a previous date as an estimation. Especially for 2018, where we may observe from the

      exceptionally parallel and ladder-like curve, we are missing some parts of data.

           As well, the analysis of the population in the hospitals of Wuhan suggests that the collective
      response did not start before the end of 2019. By concentrating on the figures of hospitals,



                                                                    13

      we align the data based on years. It was suspected that COVID-19 infections had begun at the
      second half of the year (33), so we mainly focus on the latter part of this timeline. The two lines

      of 2018 and 2019 were matched in similar trends. Generally, we see a nearly parallel shape
      from June to mid-September. It is after mid-September that we see a discernable climbing trend
      of population visiting hospitals, and the higher level persists as a plateau shape until the end of

      the year. Despite considerable missing parts of 2018 data, we can still see a jump between mid-
      year average level and end-of-year average population level as population visiting hospitals may

      rise due to seasonal reasons, e.g., people are more contagious and vulnerable to diseases when

      temperatures fall. Yet, we can see that the gap between the peak levels happening in the end of

      2019 and the peak levels happening in the end of 2018 remains almost unchanged, as in early

      periods in the year. Thus, the trend did not show significantly abnormal change in late 2019.

      This phenomenon greatly reduces the strength of any suspicion that the collective response to

      the pandemic might have begun in fall of 2019 (33), as the number of people visiting hospitals

      did not witness any aberrant rise in trends compared to the previous year.


      Conclusion

      Search index is an important indicator for monitoring the outbreak of a pandemic. In this work,

      we analyzed the correlation of search index corresponding to COVID-19-related keywords.
      We first ranked the keywords based on the correlation of the search index and the number of
      confirmed cases of COVID-19. We found that “mask,” “cough,” and “diarrhea” are within

      the 28 highly ranked keywords but not within the top rankings among all. Then, we analyzed
      the correlation between any two regions among the four regions (Wuhan, Mainland China, the

      US, and the world). We found that the correlations and the search index did not change much

      (because of COVID-19) before December, 2019, in Wuhan or in Mainland China. We thus
      argue that the collective activities start from December, 2019 in Mainland China.

                                                                    14

           Furthermore, we analyzed the mobility data of Wuhan and the population in 26 hospitals
      of Wuhan to confirm our claim. By comparing the trends in the second half of 2019 with that

      of 2018, we did not find abnormal deviations from the previous year, indicating that the start
      of the collective response to the pandemic occurred after December, 2019. Additionally, the
      increasing outflow and decreasing inflow, which signaled the pandemic, was not observed in

      the data of Baidu migration in Wuhan in the second half of 2019, further supporting the claim.

      Supplementary Materials

      In this section, we present the details on data normalization, correlation analysis of other key-
      words, and some other details.

      Data Normalization

      To visualize the search index data of keywords in different regions in a single figure, we plotted

      figures using normalized data. In Figures 1, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6,S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, S14

      and S15, we visualized the search index data of different keywords in four regions, i.e., Wuhan,

      China, the US, and the world. Given the search index of a keyword in a region from January,

      2014 to June, 2020, we normalized the data using Z-score standardization. Given the overall

      volumes of the search volume in a region from January, 2014 to June, 2020, we first calculated

      the mean value and the standard derivation value of the search index as µ and σ respectively.

      Then we normalized the search index in each region as

                                                                              DataIndexValue − µ
                               N ormalize(DataIndexValue) =                                      .                                (1)
                                                                                      σ

      In this way, the search index of each keyword in the study is normalized to almost the same

      scale, which fits into the same figure. Similarly, data normalization was also applied when we

      calculated the inflow, outflow and the population in the hospitals of Wuhan from June, 2018 to

      March, 2020.

      Ranking Results

      In this section, we present the detailed ranking results using DTW and DCCA. Table S1 rep-
      resents the ranking of the top 28 keywords in Wuhan using DTW and DCCA. From the table,

      we can see that the common highly (top 10) ranked keywords are “COVID,” “Epidemic situa-
      tion,” “Nucleic acid,” “Pneumonia,” “Sterilization,” and “Infection” based on DTW and DCCA.

                                                                    19

      In addition, “Mask” is highly ranked (4th ) using DTW. Table S2 represents the ranking of the
      top 28 keywords in China using DTW and DCCA. The common highly ranked keywords are

      “COVID,” “Nucleic acid,” “Runny nose,” “Sterilization,” and “Hypoxemia” based on DTW and
      DCCA. In addition, “Mask” is also highly ranked using DTW (8th ) and DCCA (12th ). Table
      S3 demonstrates the ranking of the top 28 keywords in the US using DTW and DCCA. The

      common highly ranked keywords are “COVID,” “Mask,” “Sterilization,” “Body temperature,”
      and “Epidemic” based on DTW and DCCA. “Mask” is also highly ranked using both DTW

      (2nd ) and DCCA (1st ). Table S4 demonstrates the ranking of the top 28 keywords all over the

      world, using DTW and DCCA. The common highly ranked keywords are “COVID,” “Mask,”

      “Sterilization,” “Body temperature,” “Epidemic situation,” “Respiratory distress,” and “Respi-

      ratory failure” based on DTW and DCCA. “Mask” is highly ranked using both DTW (2nd ) and

      DCCA (2nd ).

      Correlation Analysis of “Cough” and “Diarrhea”

      In this section, we present the correlation analysis on “Mask,” “Cough,” and “Diarrhea”. “Cough”

      and “Diarrhea” are considered as key symptoms for COVID-19 in (33).

      Correlation Analysis of “Mask”

      The search volumes of “mask” in four regions are shown in Figures S1 and S2.

      Correlation Analysis of “Cough”

      Similar to “mask,” as shown in Figure S3, we can see that the correlations were positive and
      did not change much between 2014 and 2019. In 2015, the correlations became less signifi-

      cant, which may also have been caused by the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
      (MERS), as “cough” is one of the most important symptoms (36). However, the correlations
      have changed to be negative in 2020. In addition, the search index also significantly increased in

                                                                    20

      Wuhan and China. The volumes spiked significantly in Wuhan and China in December, 2019

      found in December, 2019 (3, 37).

      Correlation Analysis of “Diarrhea”

      The correlation analysis of “Diarrhea” is shown in Figure S6, we can see that the correlation

      stayed positive and the search index increased from 2014 to 2018. In 2019, the correlations

      became a little bit less significant. In addition, the correlations and the search index (in Wuhan

      and China) have dropped to negative in 2020, which indicates the collective response to the
      COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
           To analyze the decrease of the correlation from 2019, we zoom in on 2019 and 2020. Figure

      S7 shows that the search volumes actually decreased in Wuhan or China from June, 2019 to
      November, 2019. This result indicates that there was no evidence to support the outbreak of
      diarrhea-related epidemic in Wuhan or China before December, 2019. In addition, Figure S8

      shows that the search volume of “diarrhea” increased from December, 2019 and reached its peak

      in January, 2020 in Wuhan and in February, 2020 in China. Similar to the “cough,” the search

      volumes of “Diarrhea” spiked in Wuhan and China in December, 2019 compared to the US

      and the world. This is also due to the fact that early confirmed cases were found in December,

      2019 (3, 37).

      Changes of Correlation Coefficients Over Time

      In Figures S9, S10, and S11, we visualize correlations using DCCA and the search index in four
      regions for 3 other keywords. The correlations were positive and did not change much before

      2020 except 2015 because of MERS. The correlations have significantly decreased in 2020,
      which coincided with the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. In addition, the search index of the
      3 keywords reveals that the early stage of the collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic

      starts from the end of 2019, i.e., December of 2019.

      Spearman’s Rank Correlation Analysis

      We examined the correlations of search trends between every pairs of the four geographical
      regions, i.e., China, Wuhan, the US, and the world, using Spearman’s rank correlation (38).

           With the correlation coefficients, we apply the hypothesis test of the “significance of the
      correlation coefficient” to decide whether the correlation between two search trends is signif-
      icant or not. We use the significant level of 0.05, which is α = 0.05. Thus, we consider the

      correlation with p-value less than 0.05 as “significantly correlated”; otherwise, the correlation

      is considered “insignificant.” By summing up the number of queries with significant corre-

      lated trends, an indicator for overall correlation of epidemic-relation search queries between

      two regions can be drawn.

           To clearly identify the changing trends from 2014 to 2020, we separate the data into 7 sub-

      sets according to the corresponding year. Figure S12 shows the yearly trends for the number of

      significant queries between two of the four examined regions. Except for 2020, during which

      the number of queries with significant correlated trends between World and USA decreases to

      18, the overall trend with high correlation can be observed. The decreasing number of queries

      with significant correlated trends can be summarized as that the status of the USA is different

      from the global trends in terms of the epidemic. The number of queries with significant cor-
      related trends reveals an overall decreasing pattern from 2014 to 2020. Especially in 2020, all

      the queries we examined are insignificant, when comparing their global trends and the trends
      in China. Similar to the above comparison, the number of queries with significant correlated
      trends between World and Wuhan reveals an overall decreasing trend from 2014 to 2020. In

      2020, the number of queries with significant correlated trends decreases to 2. This matches
      the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan. In 2020, only the search trends of 2 queries are signif-
      icantly correlated in the USA and China. This concurs with the different timing of outbreaks

      of COVID-19 in the USA and China. In 2020, the search trends of 23 queries in China and in

                                                                    28

      Wuhan are significantly correlated. This concurs with the fact that national attention has been
      highly focused on COVID-19 during the first five months of 2020. The analysis results indicate

      that the collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic exists in 2020.

      Search Data Analysis of Second Wave of Epidemic in Beijing

      For over 30 search queries related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we analyze the daily search
      index trend in Beijing from March 1st, 2020 to July 20th, 2020 for each keyword, as Beijing

      was in the center of the epidemic. From the analysis, we are able to categorize them into two

      main categories, one group that has an abnormal rise in accordance with the pandemic shown

      in Figure S14, and another that has a relatively mild reaction shown in Figure S15. Some rep-

      resentative queries that belong to the first category include “nucleic acid,” “epidemic,” “mask,”

      “sore throat,” “fever,” “fatigue,” “pneumonia,” “diarrhea,” “coronavirus,” “Xinguan (stands for

      COVID),” “patient,” and “body temperature.” These words are mostly in high rankings in our

      previous correlation analysis, indicating consistency and effectiveness of analytical tools above.

      Let us take the word “epidemic” as an example. The searching trend of this word underwent

      stable declination throughout the period until the start of June, with the highest point between

      1.5 and 2 at very first of March and the trough at around -1.5 on June 5th. This downward slope
      can be explained by a continuous period of zero confirmed cases in Beijing, and people grad-
      ually becoming less vigilant on the prevention of COVID-19. Yet, the search trend skyrockets

      significantly after June 10th, reaching its peak at more than 3.5 in merely 4 days. This nearly
      vertical line fits into the sudden onset of the second wave of COVID-19, as the first case was
      published in the news on June 11th, where the daily increase became abnormally high. This

      tremendous increase in search persisted for almost 14 days. The declination afterwards may
      be due to the fact that the number of newly confirmed cases fell as the government actively

      engaged in testing and containment measures in relevant locations in Beijing. The entire set of
      abnormal trends fits perfectly with the developing situation of the second wave of the pandemic,

      indicating the close-knit relationship between search trends and epidemic circumstances and the
      effectiveness of using search volume data as tools for exploring public reactions. Other search
      queries, such as “fever” and “nucleic acid,” show very similar patterns, with either parallel trend

      or decreasing trend over the past few months, and an obvious, exceptional, sudden rise starting
      at around June 10th or June 11th. One intriguing factor is that the keyword “diarrhea” is also

      in category one, with a significant high peak from June 10th to June 19th. However, “diarrhea”

      ranked relatively low in previous DCCA and DTW rankings, meaning that it’s not considered

      very pertinent to the virus by the general public. Yet, its search trend’s acute rise in the second

      wave of the epidemic differs from previous search trend changes in the first national wave. One

      reason may be that the epidemic center of Beijing is in Xinfadi, one of the most important food

      markets in that region, so people in Beijing may have become more concerned with food safety

      and food-related searches. Similar patterns of abnormal increase also applied to other com-

      mon symptom words such as “fatigue” and “fever,” with their tremendous pump-ups in search

      volumes matching exactly with the period of the second wave of the pandemic in a range of

      approximately 15 days after the first announcement of the news, on June 11th, 2020.

           Furthermore, there are certain words that do not show abnormal patterns as discussed above,
      with no significantly abrupt increase in their overall trend from March to July 2020. For in-
      stance, the keyword “stuffy nose” has a searching trend with a peak in around the second half

      of March, following by a parallel trend throughout the period with normal daily fluctuations in
      a stable range. Although the peak at the week of June 11th, signaling the start of the second
      wave of the pandemic, was mildly wider than other fluctuations, it only showed a slightly higher

      search volume and a quick fall back to normal levels. It is hard to perceive significant traces of
      the second wave of the epidemic from the diagram directly. In similar fashion, search queries


                                                                    33

      such as “respiratory failure” and “respiratory distress” display no significant deviation from the
      general trend since March, with no especially peculiar shape of fluctuations. Although these

      words are considered relevant to COVID-19, these symptoms are more related to severely ill
      patients. Consequently, it is reasonable to see no significant change in these keywords, since
      Beijing has had only a few critically ill patients, compared to the first national wave of the pan-

      demic, resulting in many fewer people searching for these symptoms of serious illness. Other
      keywords, including “respiratory symptom,” “dehydration,” and “affection” also show no obvi-

      ous change in search volume trend during this second epidemic in Beijing. One crucial search

      query, “cough,” also displays less significant change in trend compared to other keywords.

      Upon closer examination, there is a hump from early June to the end of June, with the highest

      peak on June 11th. Yet most peaks around the period from June 11th to July 20th are still at

      equivalent levels, compared to the high points in April and May, and thus the second wave of

      Beijing epidemic outbreak did not cause a tremendous increase in search volume for “cough.”

      Among keywords, “cough” is also abnormal. It varies from other search trend changes. In the

      first national wave of the epidemic, its ranking is very high by DCCA and DTW rankings; but

      in the second wave, the public did not show a strong reaction by searching significantly more

      frequently for “cough.” Comprehensive reasons are still under investigation, but it may be due

      to the fact that the confirmed case number is not very high, due to the efficient measures to
      contain the spread. Another possibility to consider is that public education had already covered
      early on that coughs could be a symptom, while the knowledge that other symptoms, such as

      diarrhea, could derive from the new novel coronavirus emerged later. In fact, our techniques
      lend credence to the notion that looking proactively at what diagnostic terms are being searched
      for could potentially help identify symptoms that are not already known to be part of the pan-

      demic. Notwithstanding this word, most other words show strong consistency with our previous
      analysis, as search queries with ranking higher than the 15th place are mostly in category one.

      Population in the Hospitals of Wuhan

      In this section, we present the figures of population data in shelter (fangcang) hospitals (39) and
      Huanan seafood market. We calculate the total population of shelter hospitals and the popula-

      tion of Huanan seafood market. As shown in Figure S16, the figure of shelter hospitals exhibits
      highly similar patterns with the figure of hospitals described in the Section, Analysis of Popula-
      tion Densities in Hospitals of Wuhan. After areas were used to build shelter hospitals, steps to

      close off and manage ingress and egress were implemented, meaning that strict restrictions on

      people entering and leaving were enacted; thus, the population data fell off enormously. There

      is no significantly aberrant deviation of trend in population data of late 2019 in reference to data

      of late 2018. This conclusion also applies to patterns of population densities in Huanan seafood

      market as shown in Figure S17, as there is no abnormal deviation from paths in the previous

      year. Consequently, the latter part of 2019 did not witness any aberrant signal that could link to

      the collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
