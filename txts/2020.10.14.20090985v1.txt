                   Our task is to examine the relationship between the SARS-CoV-2 arrival and the
                   number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the first wave (period from March 4
                   to May 22, 2020 (unofficial data)), and socio-economic variables at the powiat
                   (county) level (NUTS-4) using simple statistical techniques such as data visual-
                   ization, correlation analysis, spatial clustering and multiple linear regression. We
                   showed that immigration and the logarithm of general mobility is the best predictor
                   of SARS-CoV-2 arrival times, while emigration, industrialization and air quality
                   explain the most of the size of the epidemic in poviats. On the other hand, infec-
                   tion dynamics is driven to a lesser extent by previously postulated variables such
                   as population size and density, income or the size of the elderly population. Our
                   analyses could support Polish authorities in preparation for the second wave of in-
                   fections and optimal management of resources as we have provided a proposition
                   of optimal distribution of human resources between poviats.
         Keywords: spatial modelling, optimal resources allocation, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2
                                                                 Introduction
                 The optimal way to cope with SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic is still unknown, with different
         countries and regions having been more successful than others in controlling of SARS-CoV-2 spread
         (Jarynowski, Wójta-Kempa, Płatek, & Belik (2020); Jarynowski, Wójta-Kempa, Płatek, & Czopek
         (2020); Gelfand et al. (2020)). What has been acknowledged worldwide is that multi-dimensional
         approach must be applied, including medical, social and geographical factors. There is an urgent
         need to optimize the war with COVID-19 to reduce the danger of extension of epidemics and its
         consequences. Priority should be given to more efficient allocation of anti-epidemic resources which
         are already in possession, or which may be quickly and cheaply expanded in times of crisis (Trzos
         et al. (2017)).

                                  COVID-19: OPTIMAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN POLAND                                                2
                 The distribution of COVID-19 cases in Poland is very diverse and the reasons for this situation
         must be examined. In this article, however, we would like to use the already known and potential
         factors of COVID-19 spread to generate the model optimizing the allocation of human resources
         in order to defeat the plague. In spatial diversity of confirmed cases of COVID-19, some factors
         have been chosen to be examined in terms of their effect on infection dynamics. Demographic (like
         age, mobility, migration etc.), social ("income","PiS_support") and COVID-related factors (popula-
         tion size,forest_density,population_density,arrival_SARS) are the ground for our proposal of proper
         sanitary staff allocation. Demographic factors, such as age structures, have shown a higher burden
         of symptomatic infections as well as mortality in countries with older versus younger populations
         (Jarynowski, Wójta-Kempa, Płatek, & Czopek (2020); Singh et al. (2020)), but regional distribu-
         tion on the level of counties was not officially disseminated until summer 2020 (Raciborski et al.
         (2020)). We try to diagnose factors that catalyse and inhibit the dynamics of infections (possible
         causal relationship). Among others, we examine the hypothesis of the inequality paradox, through
         civilization backwardness (peripheral in the system of people flows (Bartosiak (2019))) and exclu-
         sion of selected social classes (e.g. elderly loneliness (Jarynowski, Wójta-Kempa, Płatek, & Czopek
         (2020); Duplaga (2020))) which affects a smaller fraction of elderly people in Poland in comparison
         with other EU countries (Raciborski et al. (2020); ECDC (2020)). Observations from US (Killeen
         et al. (2020)) and UK (Aldridge et al. (2020)) suggest that there are several socio-economic patterns
         such which vary substantially (in Poland too) and possibly increase the risk of infection, for instance
         relative poverty. Mobility, migration and, to a lesser extent, other demographic-social diversity pat-
         terns have already proved to be key factors in the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a regional
         perspective, including USA (Messner & Payson (2020)), UK (Aldridge et al. (2020)), China (Jia et
         al. (2020)), Germany (Mense & Michelsen (2020); Felbermayr et al. (2020)), France (Pullano et al.
         (2020)), as well as internationally in Europe (Sannigrahi et al. (2020)) and around the World (Su et
         al. (2020)). Therefore, a similar picture could be expected also in Poland. Mobility and migration
         might play different roles in explaining variability of arrival time and number of cases, depending
         on the region of the country.
                 Many countries, especially low- and middle-income ones, experience many challenges when
         it comes to producing and customization of an adequate health workforce. Misallocation of health
         or sanitary workers, shortages of available health workers, and their limited productivity and per-
         formance may undermine efforts in restraining the disease. During a pandemic various sanitary
         inspections and their employees are a key link in slowing the disease spread. Sanitary Inspection
         employees (there is less than 10 000 sanitary workers in various inspections and hospitals in Poland
         overall, while in England - a country with a similar population - 18 000 new sanitary workers were
         hired during pandemic to work only with COVID-19 Mueller (2020); CNBC (2020)) have been
         extremely exhausted since March due to working on three shifts, also on Saturdays and Sundays.
         The main duties of Sanitary Inspection employees include epidemiological investigation, giving re-
         commendations to local authorities, companies, etc. according to sanitary regime, isolating infected
         people, quarantining and surveillance of their contacts, writing dozens of reports, answering phone
         calls from residents, requesting and examining smear samples. In the dynamic pandemic situation
         there is an urgent need for a radical increase in employment in the Polish Sanitary Inspection -
         especially in State Poviat Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations.
                 In the COVID-19 pandemic, regional health authorities should decide how best to organize
         services in order to maximize the use of resources. The fundamental importance for efficient man-
         agement in the region at the operational (poviat or voivodship) and tactical (outbreak or infected)

                                  COVID-19: OPTIMAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN POLAND                                                3
         level is mainly the possibility of optimal allocation of resources in time and space (Krzowski &
         Trzos (2020)), and this analysis is targeting this issue.
                 The aim of this paper is an exploratory and preliminary quantitative evaluation of the geo-
         graphical spread on the level of county/poviat (NUTS-4) of SARS-CoV-2 virus (and COVID-19
         disease caused by it) in Poland during the Spring wave of infections. There is a need for a spatial
         analysis of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Poland in order to prepare detailed solutions in
         human resources area which would further result in taking actions minimizing the risk to public
         health during autumn/winter wave of infections.
                                                               Epidemiology
                 Epidemiological data on the number of diagnosed cases in Poland in first 10 weeks after
         confirmation of first case on 04.03 formed epidemiological curve and indicate that the trend in the
         number of new diagnosed cases in most poviats in Poland was in a decreasing phase around 22.05.
         This means that the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland was already in a dying out phase outside of
         Silesia (Sitek et al. (2020)) and it continued plateauing until the end of summer for whole country. In
         108 poviats, no new cases were recorded between 1-22.05.2020 (the reference elimination period of
         about 3 weeks). 6 poviats did not report even a single case before 22.05.2020. Unfortunately, official
         data on the incidence and testing of COVID-19 are only available with geographical accuracy to
         voivodship - corresponding to NUTS-3, so in our analysis we rely on data collected by volunteers
         in social surveillance project (Rogalski (2020)). However, it should be noted that the official data
         were provided by the Ministry of Health via Twitter in the form of an image and tables which were
         not easily accessible (Ochab-Marciniak (2020)).
                 There are plenty of forecasting models for Poland, for instance statistical (exmetrix (2020);
         StatSoft (2020); Chudy (2020); Śleszyński (2020)), or phenomenological ones (Krueger (2020b);
         Rakowski (2020); Gambin & Rosniska (2020); Mostowy (2020); Gonczarek & Wojcik (2020); Jas-
         inski (2020); Jarynowski, Wójta-Kempa, Płatek, & Czopek (2020)). However, only a few models
         are targeting retrospective analysis of links between infection dynamics and explanatory variables
         such as population density (Sitek et al. (2020)), elderly population (Tarnowski (2020)), sex (Ra-
         ciborski et al. (2020)) or tests numbers (StatSoft (2020)). Lessons from prior experience in various
         counties (poviats) should be drawn to assist the design of a future reaction.
                                                          Data and methodology
                 The main purpose of a secondary analysis of existing registry data is to identify particular
         interactions of some economic and social variables with the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections
         occurring in various areas of Poland. The level of analysis is the county/poviat (380 poviats) which
         corresponds to NUTS-4 level. The presented material is based on data obtained on the basis of:
                 1) Data on infections from sheets (Rogalski (2020)) based on poviat / voivodeship sanitary
         inspections and regional governments as well as journalistic investigations. The database with an
         accuracy to poviats is constantly improved and updated (in the article we present the data until
         22.05), but it contains about 5% of missing data. Thanks to this database we can define the following
         explanatory variables:
                 • arrival time (denoted as arrival_SARS) in days - we define it as the difference between the
         day of announcing the first confirmed case of the COVID-19 in a given poviat and 04/03/2020 -

         the first confirmed case in Poland. In the absence of positive cases in a given poviat, we assume a
         maximum value of 83 (we virtually infect these poviats on May 23, 2020);
                   • Number of cases (denoted as size_COVID) - defined as the cumulative number of cases
         until 22/05/2020.
                   There are available other non-official datasets with geographical distribution created by vo-
         lunteers (UMW (2020); AmbasadaKultury (2020)), but they do not keep poviat NUTS-4 level as a
         reference. Due to unavailable data from some poviats, we have partly interpolated data from cities
         of Opole, Kielce, Radom, Koszalin, Siedlce, Ostroł˛eka, Płock, Piotrkow Trybunalski, Jelenie Gora,
         Skierniewice.
                   2) Registered data form GUS-Statistics Poland (GUS (2020)) - exact definitions are available
         from Statistics Poland:
                   • earnings (Income) - normalized data on earnings in the economy in 2019 (100 - average for
         Poland);
                   • afforestation (Forest_density) - % area of forests in 2018;
                   • population_density - in person/km2 in 2019;
                   • population_size - the number of people living in a given poviat in 2018 (normalized to
         maximum 100);
                   • internal and external migrations (Internal / External _Emi / Immigration) - the number of
         people who change permanent residence for a given reason in 2017 for each poviat;
                   • occupational structure (empl_ industry / agriculture / service) - number of persons work-
         ing in the industrial / agricultural / service sectors in 2014, which can be linked with workplace-
         associated infections (GIS (2020); Krueger (2020a)) and level of remote working (Wojta-Kempa &
         Jarynowski (2020));
                   • number of people in post-productive age >=65 in males and >=60 in females (postproduc-
         tion_age) in 2019, as the number of older people has the potential to be associated with the size of
         the pandemic due to the greater vulnerability of the senior population to symptomatic disease and
         COVID-19 diagnosis (Jarynowski, Wójta-Kempa, Płatek, & Czopek (2020); ECDC (2020));
                   • total sales of industrial enterprises (industry_revenue) in 2018 in million PLN.
                   The data comes from various years due to the fact that after 2015 data on employment sectors
         are no longer provided on the poviat level. In order to analyse the interaction between variables,
         we have introduced mixed variables (imitating interactions between variables), e.g. the fraction
         of people in post-working age (senior_fraction) and the fraction of people employed in industry
         (industry_faction) to the entire population of the poviat.
                   3) Data from GUS Poznan on job mobility (GUSPoznan (2020)) from 2016-2017. Number
         of persons registered in the tax office covering municipality A (living) and working in municipality
         B (place of registration of the employer). The data has been aggregated to the poviat level. We built
         a directed weighted network of commuting patterns 1 :
                   • the total number (mobility) of people entering and leaving a given poviat (this variable is
         not included in regression models due to co-linearity);
                   • In-mobility (mob_in) - the sum of weights of incoming edges (the number of people work-
         ing in a given district and living in another) of the mobility graph;
                   • Out-mobility (mob_out) - the sum of the outbound edge weights (the number of people
         residing in a given poviat and working in another) of the mobility graph;
            1
              It is worth to mention that commuting patters could be different: some of people are commuting on the daily basis,
         some returning home for weekend, others only for holidays, etc.

                 4) Geographic coordinates of poviats’ centroids (longitude / latitude) in degrees. We also
         calculated the radial distances between centroids of poviats d(x, y) in degrees. We have created
         measures of geographical dependence for each poviat y with the influence of other 379 poviats x as:
                 neighborsarr (y) = x6=y arrSARS(x)                 and neighborssize (y) = x6=y sizeCOV         ID(x)

                 5) Results from the National Electoral Commission (PKW (2020)) in European Parliamentary
         election - support for PiS (Law and Justice) ruling party. The dataset was chosen because of the fact
         that due to the lack of data from surveys with poviat accuracy, election preferences could be good
         indicators of social attitudes in local communities (Jarynowski & Klis (2012)).
                 6) Air Quality (GIOS (2020)) interpolation for each poviat. Mean particulate matter:
         PM10 (denoted as PM) concentration in µ g/m3 over the years 2012-2015.
                 All explanatory and explained (sizeCOVID(x), arrSARS(x)) variables are numeric and satisfy
         ratio scale condition. The main statistical approach is calculating multiple regressions with Akaike
         selection criteria on the SARS-CoV-2 arrival time to each poviat and the number of COVID-19
         cases based on socio-economic variables. Multidimensional scaling techniques were also applied.
         It should be noted that PCA clustering differs from hierarchical clustering [Fig. 1], for instance in
         including also significant opposite relations into one cluster. Moran’s spatial autocorrelation was
         applied to measure similarity in infection dynamics between nearby poviats.
                                                                    Results
         Correlations, regressions and multidimensional scaling
                 There is a significant difference between disease dynamics in Silesia and the rest of Poland
         (Śleszyński (2020)) and our task is to present this complex structure. The most significant factor
         for the progression / propagation of the infectious diseases is often human mobility (Belik et al.
         (2011)). In the hierarchical system (dendrograms) of correlation matrix, one can notice a cluster of
         strongly positively correlated variables such as simple mobilities, age and industrialization (top left
         Fig. 1). The next cluster contains variables related to population, complex mobility measures and
         the number of COVID-19 cases (middle bands Fig. 1). The last cluster (bottom right Fig. 1) refers
         to variables slightly negatively correlated which are related to geographical and social aspects as
         well as SARS-CoV-2 arrival time.
                 We have calculated Moran’s I - measures of spatial autocorrelation with inverse radial dis-
         tance (1/d(x,y)). We proved that arrival time is slightly and outbreak size is moderately related with
         the locations where they were measured (both correlations are statistically significant) [Tab. 1].

                 Linear regression of the full model [Fig. 2] indicates a small (on the verge of statistical
         significance) role of geographical proximity of the appearance of the first cases for arrival time to a
         new place and a small (but statistically significant) role of clustering poviats with a similar number
         of cases.

         Methodology in points 2 and 3 respectively.
                 The arrival time in poviats could be explained (6%) by logarized mobility, which is evidence
         of the non-linear nature of relationships. The number of cases could be explained (14%) by the
         number of people in post-productive age. This is certainly associated with over-representation of
         the symptomatic course of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the elderly (ECDC (2020)), but socio-
         economic relationships are also possible. The next factors are emigration: internal (9%) and external
         (5%) and outgoing mobility (4%), which may be associated with a wave of returns from the area of
         high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, possibly also influenced by reasons of socio-economic nature. Other
         important factors are also the population size (6%) and income (4%).
                 Principal component analysis (PCA) on all variables reveals 3 main clusters also marked in
         Fig. 2 (explained variance in bracket):
                 • demographic               (45%)       -    ("postproduction_age",         "internal_emigration",          "in-
         ternal_immigration",                 "external_immigration",          "industry_revenue",            "empl_industry",
         "empl_services", "mob_in", "mobility", "pagerank_mob", "betweenness_mob", "senior_fraction",
         "industry_fraction") taking into account variables related to the elderly, employment structure and
         mobility;
                 • covid-like (11%) - ("population_size", "forest_density", "population_density", "ar-
         rival_SARS", "size_COVID", "mob_out", "log_mobility", "closeness_mob", "neighbors_size",
         "neighbors_arr" , ‘PM’) taking into account variables related to pandemic, population size and
         density, air quality, spatial correlates and non-linear migration;
                 • social (8%) - ("longitude", "PiS_support", "income", "external_emigration",
         "empl_agriculture") taking into account variables related to distance to Germany, income,
         emigration, agriculture and social attitudes linked to voting preferences.
         Selective multiple regression
                 The transmission dynamics of infections in the already affected areas is mainly determined
         by behavioural factors such as the structure of contacts and compliance with risk mitigation re-
         commendations (Jarynowski, Wójta-Kempa, Płatek, & Czopek (2020); Jarynowski, Wójta-Kempa,
         Płatek, & Belik (2020)). Structure of transmission routes in Poland (GIS (2020); Krueger (2020a))
         and worldwide (ECDC (2020)) suggests that the main transmission route are intensive and long-
         term contacts (home and occupational infections have about 75% share of infections). Mobil-
         ity/Migration has a different function in catalysing transmission in an already infected area. Based

         on analyses among smartphone users with activated geolocation and Internet connection, the de-
         crease in mobility to baseline values during the most extensive restrictions in the general population
         was in the range of 30-70%(Krueger (2020b)), and mobility has slowly returned to normal levels
         since restrictions were lifted (Krueger (2020a)). It is worth to mention that mobility in Silesia de-
         creased to a significantly lesser extent during the restriction period than in other areas of Poland
         (Selectivv (2020)). The main model was selected (without taking into account spatial correlations
         and interactions between the number of cases and the arrival time to show explanatory variables
         only) by the mixed backward / forward selection method using the Akaike criterion [Tab. 2]. We
         chose linear regression as a zero approach, while each of our depending variables could be adopted
         by separate model. Starting point includes:
                                                                P GU S GU S                   P GU Smob GU Smob

                 and the final models are composed with selected (most important) variables in Tab. 2.
                 Selected regressions [Tab. 2] need to be interpreted together with correlation matrix [Fig. 1]
         and full model [Fig. 2], because we are dealing with a strongly correlated system.
                 Other network centralities (Jarynowski et al. (2014)) based on employee flow networks, i.e.
         closeness, pagerank and betweenness, also correlate with explained variables (particularly, close-
         ness correlates with the time of arrival and pagerank with the number of cases). Due to the observed
         non-linearities, the logarithm of mobility was also taken into account and it strongly correlates with
         the arrival time. After mobility / migration, the employment in industry correlates the most with
         the number of cases [Fig. 1]. Due to population flows in the form of commuting and interaction
         between employees, industry is a sector that is impossible to be digitalized and switched to remote
         work (PolskiInstytutEkonomiczny (2020)). The arrival time correlates the strongest with mobility /
         migration (especially the outgoing direction, which may suggest above all the outflow of employ-
         ees, especially abroad and could be associated with their returns to Poland). Professional activity
         was also important for the rapid emergence of the virus, especially in the field of industry.
                 Strong effect sizes of mobility in all dimensions and structure of employ-
         ment/industrialization in the selected model for number of cases (fit R2 ~0.5) shows the
         socio-economic conditioning of a epidemic [Tab. 2]. Regions with a highest employment
         rates (mainly in poorly paid industry and service) have significantly higher burden of COVID-19.
         PM10 is also a statistically significant catalyst of the outbreak size, hence it can be said that air qual-
         ity could moderate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection Conticini et al. (2020). Poor-quality air
         has been already known to be a risk factor contributing to the development of respiratory diseases
         (Kowalski & Konior (2020)). The fit of the selected model for arrival times is on the level of R2 ~0.3
         only and mobility, internal immigration and international emigration, support for the PiS (ruling)
         party (which is indirectly associated with the social structure of the electorate (Jarynowski & Klis
         (2012))) significantly accelerated the appearance of the first SARS-CoV-2 cases. In addition, a
         longitude (proxy of distances from economic attractors in Western Europe, in which SARS-Cov-2
         arrived earlier than in Poland) is borderline significant. It is worth noting that the size of population,
         density (which was a contradiction to correlation and non-selective multiple regression model) as
         well as income of individuals do not significantly differentiate the infection dynamics in a selective
         model [Tab. 2].

         most vulnerable counties to be supported with the highest priority, we propose combination of cri-
         teria obtained from selected model [Tab. 2]:
                 • high predicted No. cases (to support poviats with the highest level of prognosed cases);
                 • high Residuals in No. cases (to support poviats which have more cases than it’s predicted
         by the model, because our model was trained only on limited predictor space and maybe there are
         other non-random important factors);
                 • short predicted arrival times (to support poviats which are the most likely to be the earliest
         to have new wave of cases).
                 We have standardized each criteria and proposed a composition of a zero approach optimiz-
         ation schema:
                 opt(i) = ressize (i)i + predsize (i) − predarr (i).

          overloaded channels. We decide to support counties only with positive opt proportionally to its
          value to get first attempt to the optimal allocation [Fig. 3].

         recommend to think about supporting poviats as shown [Fig. 3].
                 Considering proper allocation of sanitary workers, we assume that it should overlap with the
         actual path of spreading the infections. On the map we can see several strategic regions (poviats)
         which should be empowered by new sanitary workers. In the presented illustration, we present the
         option of allocating new employees of sanitary services. 40-50 new employees should be located
         in the most risky zones to support the fight against the raging epidemic. These zones are Warsaw
         and Wroclaw, Krakow, Silesian Agglomeration, but also other large cities with high population
         density (Tri-City). Regions requiring additional investment are also poviats from the Opolskie,
         MaÅopolskie and Lodzkie voivodships. The Authors are aware, that second wave of Covid-19 in
         Autumn may bring another local epidemic outbreaks. The presented map is the visualisation of
         possible action, based on spatial numbers of infections. Its main aim is take first step to discuss the
         optimal way to cope with infectious threat.
                                                                 Conclusions
                 Our spatial analysis of disease incidence can be an example of the application of social geo-
         graphy in public health. Since August, mitigation strategies in Poland have been regionalised on the
         poviat level. The analysis of poviat characteristics in the context of the number of cases of disease
         is not only an attempt to understand the current situation, but also to initiate a discussion on the
         optimal distribution of resources necessary to fight health threats, such as epidemics of infectious
         diseases.
                 The most important conclusions carried out from the analyzes are:
                 1. SARS-CoV-2 infections classified at the poviat level are detected in the wide belt in the
         Southern part of Poland. In the analyzed period, the highest number of infections occurred in
         the following voivodships: Slaskie, Mazowieckie, Malopolskie, Wielkopolskie and Dolnoslaskie.
         COVID-19 hit the most early and strongly the most connected and richest regions (e.g. the Silesian
         agglomeration, Warsaw, Wrocław), and the least those which are poor and less-connected (e.g. in
         the belt of relative poverty from Lubuskie to Mazury (Śleszyński (2018))). The pandemic reached
         the economic periphery statistically significantly later (comparing arrival times) and to a lesser
         extent (comparing the number of cases) [Fig. 1, Tab. 2]. However, the outflow nature of regions
         with a large number of Polish emigrants significantly accelerated the appearance of the first cases
         and outbreaks there. Imported cases were the most frequent category of confirmed cases for the
         first 3 weeks after official introduction to Poland (Krueger (2020a); Jarynowski, Wojta-Kempa, et
         al. (2020)). SARS-CoV-2 virus officially arrived later in less urbanized (e.g. heavily forested) areas.
                 2. The analysis showed that some features of poviats (administrative units) are conducive
         to disease. Poviats with large workplaces employing a lot of stationary commuters ("low-wage
         industries") became large hotspots during the first wave of the epidemic. The poviats in the western
         belt, with the predominance of smaller establishments or workplaces enabling remote work, did not
         record so much outliers from the average number of cases.
                 3. The impact (especially negative) of social inequalities was visible, e.g. in the US and
         UK, where poorer counties (with a large fraction of the poor) were significantly less able to combat
         COVID-19 (Gelfand et al. (2020); Messner & Payson (2020); Bartscher et al. (2020)).This is also in
         agreement with other European Union studies, where regions with high social capital are more prone
         to high COVID-19 notification numbers, especially in the first phase of the outbreak (Bartscher et al.
         (2020)). However, this is not a case in Poland (income is a catalyst of infection dynamics, although
         not a significant one [Fig.1, 2]). The hypothesis about perpetuating inequalities (Domanski (2020))

         is unlikely to work out on an ecological level (aggregated to the poviat). Also data on population
         mortality in individual terms from Europe (e.g. from Sweden) suggest that income could increase
         (in some cohorts) the risk of death from COVID-19 (Drefahl et al. (2020)).
                 4. Importantly, the likelihood of mass tourism and business travel had no effect on explaining
         the variability of either the number of cases or the arrival times, which distinguishes Poland from
         other countries like Germany (Felbermayr et al. (2020); Kovacs et al. (2020)) or USA (Killeen et
         al. (2020)). This can be explained by the still low purchasing power of Poles (an average Pole
         travels abroad touristically 5 times less often than a German (Delhey et al. (2019))). The lack of
         significance of external immigration could be associated with its marginal size in 2017 (Statistics
         Poland does not provide newer data), and perhaps with current data the effect of the inflow of foreign
         immigrants (Górny & Śleszyński (2019)) would be more pronounced due to the exponential increase
         of immigrants in the last few years e.g. in Greater Poland (Paradowski et al. (2020)). Immigration
         will not affect the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland in such an extend during Autumn/Winter wave
         due to reduced international mobility and obligatory quarantine for travelers outside of EU.
                 5. Global centrality measures (such as closeness, pagerank or betweenness) do not explain
         the variability in infection dynamics better than local measures (total weighted as well as incoming
         and outgoing vertex centrality), in which Poland is also different from other countries (Jia et al.
         (2020); Maier & Brockmann (2020); Felbermayr et al. (2020); Pullano et al. (2020)). This could be
         explained by relatively short chains of infections, which is probably associated with the simultan-
         eous introduction of the virus into a large number of poviats (Pybus (2020)), which were the source
         for only one neighbouring poviat on average. This interpretation could be also confirmed by the fact
         that the geographical proximity of already infected poviats did not significantly affect arrival times
         in terms of regressions [Fig. 2] or in much smaller extent to number of cases in Moran’s correlations
         [Tab. 1]. Only the number of cases in neighbouring poviats significantly affects the arrival time and
         the number of cases in a given poviat.
                 6. The elderly population in Poland has relative small impact on infections dynamics (espe-
         cially nursing homes and long term care facilities, which are very often picked by media, but they
         comprise only 3% of all diagnosed cases from "Epibaza/SRWE dataset" (Krueger (2020a))). How-
         ever, these numbers must be interpreted with caution, because in "National Institute of Cardiology
         dataset" especially nursing homes and long term care facilities account for 13% infections in a sim-
         ilar time frame (Raciborski et al. (2020)). The size or fraction of the senior population is losing its
         importance in the selected model [Tab. 2].
                 7. Population density or population size lose predictive power against the infection dynamics
         in favour of other variables too [Tab. 2]. This may mean that the size of the pandemic is primarily
         related to the socio-economic conditioning of the regions and in a much smaller extent to demo-
         graphics such as age structure or population density.
                 8. A statistically significant relationship between the number of cases and the support of
         the currently ruling party reveals the likely relationship between PiS electorate (large industrial and
         mining plants and medium-sized cities, a large percentage of older people, high level of emigration
         etc.) and vulnerability to outbreaks. It may also be related to the level of effectiveness of selected
         in local elections authorities in managing the epidemic at the poviat level. Moreover, areas that
         have proven experience in the fight against infectious diseases (e.g. nosocomial infections as NDM-
         2 stains Jarynowski, Grabowski, et al. (2019)) such as Poznan proceed better than it would be
         predicted by a simple socio-economic model classification.

                                COVID-19: OPTIMAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN POLAND                                                13
         Poland is one of the priorities of the epidemic management. Our proposal to allocate new sanitary
         workers is based primarily on a spatial analysis of the number of infections. In our opinion, the
         proper allocation of human resources can contribute to the launch of quick paths to react to new
         outbreaks, especially where stationary work is the basis for the implementation of tasks (production,
         processing plants, etc.).
                 To sum up, mobility/migration and occupation structure in geographic regions associated
         mainly with industry and employment rates play the most important role in infection dynamics Po-
         land. However, this paper is just an ecological (on the level of poviat) retrospective correlation
         study and its low position in hierarchy of evidence-based medicine must be stressed. It has also a
         plenty of limitations, such as controlling only for selected variables. For instance, there are defin-
         itely differences in testing strategies (not considered in our analysis), for example 20% of share in
         total number of test are coming from Warsaw region, which has only 5% share of total population
         (Rogalski (2020)). The greatest bias factor is the unofficial character of surveillance, as it led, for
         instance, to the fact that missing data in infection dynamics caused interpolation modification which
         was applied for almost 5% of poviats. Statements similar to those presented in this article can also
         be applied to the number of deaths classified due to Covid-19. Their overtones would perhaps be a
         stronger argument for the central authorities.
                                                  Discussion and Recommendation
                 Lockdown (closing schools and most nonessential businesses) was proved to be the most ef-
         fective intervention slowing down COVID-19 epidemic (Haug et al. (2020)). However, it does not
         seem to be cost-effective. Spring lockdown costs in UK (Miles et al. (2020)) was roughly estim-
         ated to 300k GBP/QALY, which exceeded 10 holds profitable threshold. In Poland, the restrictions
         and measures already applied during Spring cost the economy almost 50 billion EUR (Pinkas et al.
         (2020); Raciborski et al. (2020); MinisterstwoF inansowP l (2020)), with roughly estimate ~500k
         PLN/QALY, which exceeded also 10 holds profitable threshold (InfodemiaP olsce (2020)). Thus,
         the most cost-effective (except Standard Precaution (Rosiński et al. (2019)) and proper communic-
         ation (Jarynowski, Wójta-Kempa, & Belik (2020a,b))) mitigation technique: "trace, track, treat and
         isolate" could be applied during the second wave to a much greater extent and with geographical
         precision as we proposed in this paper.
                 Healthcare systems must be accessible, effective, and adequately respond to unexpected situ-
         ations such as an outbreak of an infectious disease. In Poland, healthcare systems are heavily
         burdened with patient demographics (mainly due to age) and suffer from labor shortages. That is
         why it is so important to make the right decisions in relation to the current situation, so as not to
         increase inequalities in access to healthcare. Providing adequate access to medical personnel in the
         country (especially at the place of residence) based on the needs of its inhabitants is one of the most
         important challenges of modern health policy. However, the most satisfactory approach is to plan
         the optimal human resource allocation, in 2020 we have to act quickly to minimize the consequences
         of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Epidemiological services (especially the Sanitary Inspection) should be
         particularly strengthened in highly connected regions and with industrial / high employment charac-
         teristics, so that they could quickly and efficiently investigate and close outbreaks (Krueger (2020b))
         in workplaces. Certainly, Sanitary Inspection should keep monitoring and investigating outbreaks in
         houses, nursing homes (because of high case fatality rates there), hospitals, schools etc. as before,
         yet workplaces should be prioritized. At the same time it should be noted that for many Regional
         Sanitary Inspection units the budget planned for the entire 2020 was exceeded already in April

         (WSSElubuskie (2020)), and central/local governments in the regions co-finance them to varying
         degrees. Identifying particularly endangered poviats is intended to support the fight against the
         pandemic (especially staffing for the purpose of in-depth and rapid investigation of infection out-
         breaks) and under no circumstances can it be interpreted as stigmatizing individual poviats and their
         residents, which is associated with detached risk perception (Jarynowski, Wójta-Kempa, & Belik
         (2020b)).
                 Proper data is a key to understand and prepare for Autumn/Winter wave of infections
         (Duszynski (2020)). Moreover, we regret that most of Polish researchers cannot work of official
         detailed surveillance data, while data used by institutions within Ministry of Health seems to be at
         least inconstant in comparison with public available resource.
                 We recommend that during the next wave of infections, Polish Sanitary Inspection should be
         strengthened in terms of staff and IT services in high risk poviats.
