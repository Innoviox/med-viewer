    Highlights of the Study
         •    A significantly higher proportion of Diabetic COVID-19 patients required admission to the ICU.
         •    Higher fasting blood glucose was associated with higher risk of COVID-19 associated mortality.
         •    Diabetic COVID-19 patients had significantly higher incidence of complications including sepsis,
              ARDS, cardiac failure and renal failure.

    Abstract
    Background: COVID-19 has a highly variable clinical presentation, ranging from asymptomatic to severe
    respiratory symptoms and death. Diabetes seems to be one of the main comorbidities contributing to a
    worse COVID-19 outcome.
    Objective: In here we analyze the clinical characteristics and outcomes of diabetic COVID-19 patients.
    Methods: In this single-center, retrospective study of 417 consecutive COVID-19 patients, we analyze
    and compare disease severity, outcome, associated complications, and clinical laboratory findings
    between diabetic and non-diabetic COVID-19 patients.
    Results: COVID-19 patients with diabetes had more severe outcomes and higher mortality than non-
    diabetic COVID-19 patients. Diabetic COVID-19 patients had significantly higher prevalence of
    comorbidities, such as hypertension. Laboratory investigations also highlighted notably higher levels of
    C-reactive protein in diabetic COVID019 patients and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. They
    also showed a higher incidence of complications.
    Conclusion: Diabetes could be a major contributor to worsening outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
    Understanding the pathophysiology underlining these findings could provide insight into better
    management and improved outcome of such cases.

         1.   Introduction
    In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
                                                                                  1
    Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China . Since then, it has spread rapidly all
    over the world and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11,
    2020. With the number of cases currently reaching 22 million and more than 800,000 deaths,
                                                                      2, 3
    the virus poses a major threat to global health                       .
    Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by the virus, has shown a highly
    variable clinical presentation, ranging from asymptomatic to severe illness leading to death. The
    symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, headache, and loss of
    taste or smell. Most patients experience mild symptoms, although some may develop serious
    complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, septic
                                                                                               4-8
    shock, and hypercoagulation, which can eventually lead to death                                 . The exact reasons for the
    observed variability in disease manifestations and outcomes are not fully understood. Whereas
                                                                    9
    pediatric cases show a milder clinical course , a worse prognosis has been associated with older
                                   8
    age and being male . Emerging evidence also indicates that preexisting medical conditions,
    including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive
    pulmonary disease, solid organ transplantation, and diabetes, can increase the risk of poor
                                  10-13
    COVID-19 prognosis                  .
    Diabetes      mellitus        is   a    chronic     metabolic       disease  characterized          by the    occurrence          of
    hyperglycemia for a prolonged period. It is associated with serious long-term complications,
                                                                                            14

    million people, has a major impact on global health. It is among the top 10 causes of adult
                               15
    deaths worldwide              . In the past two decades, two coronaviruses have emerged that have
    caused widespread               respiratory illness and deaths. In 2002, SARS coronavirus                          (SARS-CoV)
    emerged in China, causing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. In 2012, another
    coronavirus, MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged in Saudi Arabia, causing Middle East
    respiratory syndrome. Experience with both syndromes revealed that diabetes was a risk factor
                                                     16, 17
    for poor prognosis and mortality                         . Similarly, initial reports of the clinical characteristics of
                                                      1, 8, 18
    COVID-19 showed a similar trend                           . Given the global burden of diabetes and the pandemic
    course of SARS-CoV-2, understanding how diabetes contributes to a worse COVID-19 prognosis
    is important. Several studies have shown that type 2 diabetes, which is the most prevalent type
    of the disease, is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation that affects the homeostatic
    glucose     regulation         and      insulin   sensitivity.   The    combination       of    chronic  inflammation          and
    hyperglycemia could contribute to an abnormal immune response by weakening T-cell function,
                                                                                                                       19, 20
    in addition to an increased risk of hyperinflammation and cytokine storm syndrome                                        , which
    in turn can worsen the COVID-19 disease outcome.
    Understanding how diabetes worsens COVID-19 outcomes can help provide better disease
    management and contribute to the improvement in disease outcomes. In this study, we
    perform a comprehensive clinical analysis of COVID-19 patients with and without type 2
    diabetes.      We        analyze        and    compare        the   distribution     of   disease      severity,    associated
    complications, and death outcomes between the two groups.

         2.   Subjects and Methods
    2.1 Study design
    The Standing Committee for Coordination of Health and Medical Research at the Ministry of
    Health in Kuwait reviewed and approved this retrospective study (Institutional Review Board
    2020/1404). The Standing Committee waived the requirement for written informed consent
    because of the urgency of data collection and the exceptional nature of the disease. All
    procedures involving human participants were performed following the relevant guidelines and
    regulations. The medical records of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad
    Hospital in Kuwait between February 24 and May 24, 2020, were accessed, analyzed, and
    included in this study. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was established based on positive viral real-
    time    reverse        transcriptase-polymerase               chain   reaction     (RT-PCR)        assay  of   nasal      and/or
    pharyngeal swabs, following the World Health Organization’s interim guidance. Cases were
    divided into two main groups: patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes. The
    diagnosis of diabetes was based on a fasting plasma glucose value of                             ≥7.0 mmol/L 21. Only type
    2 diabetes patients were                  considered in this         study as no type 1 diabetes patients were
    encoutnered. Laboratry diagnosis was confirmed with medical history. Each group was further
    divided      into     the     following      subgroups        depending     on    COVID-19         severity   and     outcome:
    asymptomatic, symptomatic with mild/moderate symptoms, intensive care unit (ICU) survivors,
    and ICU death. Data presented in this study was made available on springer nature data

    2.2 Data collection
    We included 417 confirmed COVID-19 patients in the study. The patients’ medical records were
    accessed and analyzed by our team at Dasman Diabetes Institute, Faculty of Allied Health
    Sciences      at   Kuwait       University,      and    Jaber    Al-Ahmad     Hospital.      We     obtained   and    analyzed
    demographic data, medical history, including underlying comorbidities, travel history, contact
    tracing data, clinical chemistry, hematological laboratory findings, chest radiological images,
    treatments, complications, ICU admissions and durations, and dynamics of hospital stay and
                                                                                                                23
    outcomes. The diagnosis of ARDS was determined based on the Berlin definition                                  . Acute kidney
                                                                                                                              24
    injury was evaluated following the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition                                      . The
    presence         of     cardiac         injury     was     established      based       on      cardiac    blood       markers,
                                                                      7
    electrocardiography, and/or echocardiography .
    2.3 Hospitalization dynamics
    During the patient recruitment period, Jaber Al-Ahmad Hospital by the Ministry of Health
    instituted a 100% hospitalization policy for COVID-19–positive cases. All cases with a positive
    RT-PCR test, including asymptomatic cases, were admitted, isolated, and put under medical
    surveillance. Patients in the mild/moderate group, who were hemodynamically stable and had
    no signs of respiratory distress, were admitted to the ward after RT-PCR confirmation for
    isolation, medical surveillance, and reevaluation. Patients were transferred to the ICU if they
    developed signs of respiratory distress and desaturation of oxygen levels (confirmed by pulse
    oximetry and arterial blood gases) and/or signs of hemodynamic instability that required close
    monitoring and intensive re-establishment of homeostasis. Patients with severe to critical
                                                                                                                                       7

    COVID-19 symptoms were admitted directly to the ICU if they matched any of the following
    criteria of severity: hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring respiratory support, such as patients
    who developed ARDS; hemodynamic instability due to cardiogenic or septic shock and clinical,
    radiological, or laboratory evidence of heart failure; acute cardiac injury; and acute kidney
    injury secondary to COVID-19 manifestations.
    2.4 Statistical analysis
    The variables analyzed in the study were divided into categorical and continuous variables. The
    categorical variables were described as frequencies and percentages, whereas continuous
    variables     were       presented        as  medians       and   interquartile     ranges      and    means   and    standard
    deviations. We used a one-way analysis of variance to compare means between groups; we
    used the Kruskal–Wallis H test to compare the medians of the different group laboratory
    parameters. Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square test, and when the data
    were limited, Fisher exact test was used. The differences between group means and medians
    were considered statistically significant when                       p  < 0.05. We investigated the relationship
    between fasting blood glucose as a continuous exposure and ICU admission as an outcome
    from COVID-19 as a binary response and adjusted to other covariates (age, gender, smoking
    status, diabetes status, and other comorbidities). We employed a logistic regression model and
    reported the odds ratios of the outcome of dying from COVID-19 for each 1 mmol/L increase in
    fasting blood glucose. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software
    (La Jolla, CA, USA), SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) for Windows version 25.0 (IBM
                                                                                                                                       8

         3.   Results
    3.1 Cohort characteristics
    The studied cohort consisted of 417 COVID-19 patients who were divided into two groups
    based on fasting blood glucose levels: 273 (65.5%) non-diabetic patients and 122 (29.3%)
    diabetic patients (Table 1). The mean age of the non-diabetic group was 39.55 (± 16.59) years,
    whereas the mean age of the diabetic group was 56.44 (± 11.64) years (                                 p < 0.001, Student         t-
    test; Table 1 and supplemantry Figure 1). The diabetic group had a greater incidence of fever,
    shortness of breath, and fatigue than the non-diabetic group (                            p  < 0.05, < 0.001, and < 0.05,
    respectively). However, the differences in other symptoms were not significant between the
    two groups (Table 1).
    The diabetic group had a higher prevalence of comorbidities including hypertension, asthma,
    cardiovascular disease, and chronic renal disease (                      p  < 0.001, < 0.05, < 0.001, and < 0.005,
    respectively; Table 1).

    In terms of COVID-19 severity, we found no statistically significant difference in the percentages
    of asymptomatic and mild-moderate cases between the diabetic and non-diabetic groups
    (Table 2). However, the diabetic group included a significantly higher proportion of patients
    requiring admission to the ICU (                  p  < 0.001). Without adjustment, the diabetes group had a
                                                                                                                                       9

    significantly higher percentage of death as compared with the non-diabetic group (16.7% vs.
    12.1%,    p   < 0.001; Table 2). The diabetic group also had a significantly higher prevalence of
    complications, including sepsis, ARDS, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and kidney injury
    when compared with the non-diabetic group (                       p < 0.001; Table 2).
    3.3 Fasting blood glucose level and odds ratio of death
    We used a logistic regression model and reported the odds ratios of the outcome of dying from
    COVID-19 for each 1-mmol/L increase in fasting blood glucose. We found that every 1 mmol/L
    increase in fasting glucose is associated with 1.52 (95% CI: 1.34 – 1.72, p<0.001) times the odds
    of dying from COVID-19.
    3.4 Clinical biochemistry findings
    The diabetic and non-diabetic groups were subdivided into asymptomatic, mild-moderate, and
    severe categories. The clinical biochemistry findings were compared between the patients with
    and without diabetes in the subcategories of COVID-19 severity (Table 3). The cohort was
    categorized and divided according to the fasting blood glucose level. We noted a significant
    difference in fasting blood glucose between the diabetic and non-diabetic groups across all
    subcategories. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was significantly lower in
    the diabetic group than the non-diabetic group in all subcategories. The lowest value was in the
                                                                                               2
    severe group (57.50 ± 33.81 vs. 76.46 ± 34.14 mL/min/1.73 m ,                                   p < 0.05). The other renal
    markers, creatinine and urea, were higher in general in the diabetic groups than the non-
    diabetic groups. However, the results were significant only in the severe subcategory (                                p < 0.05
    for both markers). The C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher among diabetic
                                                                                                                                     10

    patients than non-diabetic patients in all subcategories (                    p < 0.05, < 0.05, and < 0.005, in order;
    Table 3). Although procalcitonin levels were higher in all diabetic groups, the difference was not
    statistically significant. The albumin level was significantly lower in the diabetic groups across all
    subcategories than the non-diabetic groups (                      p < 0.001, < 0.001, and < 0.05, in order). White
    blood cell counts and neutrophil counts were significantly higher in the diabetic group in the
    severe     subcategory           as    compared        with   the   non-diabetic     group       (p    < 0.05  and    <    0.005,
    respectively; Table 3).
         4.   Discussion
    COVID-19 has displayed a broad spectrum of severity, ranging from asymptomatic to severe
    illness leading to death. Many factors have influence disease outcome, including age and
    gender. Severe outcomes have been associated with preexisting chronic illnesses, such as
    hypertension and diabetes. In this study, we presented the clinical characteristics and outcomes
    of diabetic COVID-19 patients in Kuwait.
    In general, we found that patients with diabetes had more severe COVID-19 outcomes than
    patients without diabetes, represented by the higher proportion of ICU admitted cases (severe)
    and deaths (Table 2). Our results are in agreement with the findings obtained from a Chinese
    COVID-19 cohort, in which COVID-19 diabetic patients had a 7.3% increased risk of mortality
                                                                          25
    compared with 2.3% for the general population                           . Moreover, a British cohort showed that
    COVID-19 patients with uncontrolled diabetes had a higher risk of death than other patients
        26
    did   . The reason why individuals with diabetes are likely to have a worse COVID-19 prognosis
    seems to be multifactorial because of the syndromic nature of diabetes. In our cohort, we
                                                                                                                                     11

    found that diabetic patients were older, had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, such as
    hypertension, had higher levels of inflammatory markers, had a lower eGFR, and had a higher
    prevalence of complications, all of which lead to worse COVID-19 outcomes (Figure 1; Tables 1–
    3). Such findings indicate the possible multifaceted pathological mechanistic pathways that lead
    to worse outcomes in COVID-19 diabetic patients.
    Inflammation plays a critical role in diabetes pathogenesis, whereby diabetic patients typically
                                                                27
    develop a chronic state of inflammation                        . We found significantly higher levels of C-reactive
    protein in all of our COVID-19 diabetic patients than non-diabetic COVID-19 patients (Table 3).
    This finding could be associated with an inflammatory status that makes these patients more
    susceptible to the damaging effects of what is known as the COVID-19 cytokine storm, which
                                                          28
    leads to multiorgan failure and death                   .
    The higher prevalence of comorbidities in diabetic patients can also contribute to their poor
    COVID-19 outcomes. Among the diabetic patients in this study, we noted a higher prevalence of
    hypertension and cardiovascular disease (57.6% and 14.1%, respectively) compared with the
    non-diabetic patients (14.7% and 4.4,% respectively; Table 1). Such results agree with the
                                                                                                                              29
    findings reported in a study conducted in Wuhan, China (56.9% and 20.9%, respectively)                                       . We
    also noted a significantly lower eGFR upon admission for diabetic patients as compared with
    non-diabetic individuals (Table 3). This finding coincided with a higher incidence of acute kidney
    injury among diabetic patients than non-diabetic patients (24.3% and 2.2%, respectively,                                       p   <
    0.001; Table 2). Diabetic patients have a higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease, which
    can eventually lead to kidney failure. The situation is worse in diabetic COVID-19 patients,
                                                                                                                                     12

                                                                                       30
    dependent pathway, leading to renal impairment and death                             .
    Our logistic regression model showed a positive correlation between fasting blood glucose
    levels and increased risk of COVID-19 death, with adjustment for other risk factors including
    age, gender, smoking status, and other comorbidities. This finding might suggest that elevated
    glucose levels could be the primary molecular trigger for a cascade of pathological events that
    contribute to the poor outcome associated with COVID-19 in diabetic patients.
    One of the major limitations of this study was the lack of BMI cohort data. Adiposity could be a
    strong predictor in such settings.
         5.   Conclusion
    In conclusion, diabetes is one of the major risk factors associated with the poor outcome and
    mortality of COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with diabetes have a higher prevalence of
    comorbidities such as hypertension, higher levels of inflammatory markers, lower eGFR, and a
    higher    incidence         of   in-hospital      complications,      which    illustrates      the    possible  multifaceted
    pathological mechanistic pathways triggered by hyperglycemia that lead to worse outcomes
    and mortality.
