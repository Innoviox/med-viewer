29                Abstract

30                Background

31                The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is

32                responsible for the current pandemic outbreak worldwide. However, there is

33                limited information regarding the set of specific symptoms of COVID-19.

34                Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the main symptoms

35                associated with COVID-19 to aid in the clinical diagnosis for the rapid

36                identification of cases.

37                Methods and findings

38                A cross sectional study of all those diagnosed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2

39                between April 1 and May 24 in Argentina was conducted. The data includes

40                clinical and demographic information from all subjects at the time of

41                presentation, which were uploaded to the centralized national reporting

42                system at health centers. A total of 67318 individuals were included in this

43                study, where 12% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The study population

44                was divided in two age groups, a group aged 0 to 55 years-old (<56 group),

45                (median = 32, n=48748) and another group aged 56 to 103 years-old (≥56

46                group) (median =72, n=18570). Multivariate logistic regression analyses

47                showed that out of a total of 23 symptoms, only five were found to have a

48                positive association with COVID-19: anosmia (odds ratio [OR] 10.40, 95%

49                confidence interval [CI] 8.20-13.10, <56 group; OR 6.09 CI 3.05-12.20, ≥56

50                group)        dysgeusia (OR 3.67, CI 2.7-4.9, <56 group; OR 3.53 CI 1.52-8.18,

51                ≥56 group), low grade fever (37.5-37.9º C) (OR 1.61, CI 1.20-2.05, <56


                                                                                                                                   3

52                group; OR 1.80 CI 1.07-3.06, ≥56 group), cough (OR 1.20, CI 1.05-1.38,

53                <56 group; OR 1.37 CI 1.04-1.80, ≥56 group) and headache only in <56

54                group (OR 1.71, CI 1.48-1.99). In turn, at the time of presentation, the

55                symptoms associated with respiratory problems: chest pain, tachypnea,

56                dyspnea, respiratory failure and use of accessory muscles for breathing,

57                had a negative association with COVID-19 (OR <1) or did not present

58                statistical relevance (OR = 1).

59                With the intention of helping the clinical diagnosis, we designed a model to

60                be able to identify possible cases of COVID-19. This model included 16

61                symptoms, the age and sex of the individuals, and was able to detect 80%

62                of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 with a specificity of 46%.

63                Conclusions

64                The analysis of symptoms opens the opportunity for a guidance and

65                improved symptoms based definition of suspected cases of COVID-19,

66                where multiple factors (age, sex, symptoms and interaction between

67                symptoms) are considered. We present a tool to help identify COVID-19

68                cases to provide quick information to aid decision-making by health

69                personnel and program managers.

70      Introduction:


71      The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is

72      responsible for the current pandemic outbreak as declared by the World Health

73      Organization on January 30th 2020 (1). By September 2020, the number of people

74      infected with SARS-CoV-2 is over 28 million worldwide with more than 900

75      thousand deaths (2). The rapid spread of the virus has demonstrated its ability to

76      overwhelm the health systems of developed countries and poses in danger

77      countries with vulnerable health systems. These particular characteristics underline

78      the adoption of social-distancing measures including quarantines, lockdowns and

79      limitations in international travel implemented by most governments.



80      Until now, the most widely used diagnostic tool is real-time reverse transcriptase

81      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasal and pharyngeal swabs (3).

82      Although, RT-PCR is highly specific, has a suboptimal sensitivity (4), and false

83      negatives have been reported (5). Without proven therapeutic drugs or vaccines,

84      the identification and isolation of infected people through contact tracing or passive

85      detection is of vital importance for controlling disease spread (4). In this context, an

86      adequate characterization of suspected cases becomes of critical importance.


87      We analyzed the symptoms corresponding to a large database obtained from

88      individuals evaluated by RT-PCR in Argentina in order to identify the symptoms

89      associated with COVID-19 and develop a model to identify possible individuals

90      infected with SARS-CoV-2.


                                                                                                                                   5

91      Materials and Methods


92      Data source


93      The data file was provided by the National Ministry of Health of Argentina

94      (Ministerio de Salud de la Nación Argentina. Dirección Nacional de Epidemiología

95      y Análisis de la Situación de Salud. Área de Vigilancia). The analysis included

96      67318 people evaluated through RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 throughout the country

97      from April 1 through May 24, 2020 and included in the registry of the National

98      Ministry of Health. Several variables including age, sex, RT-PCR result (positive or

99      negative), and symptoms at presentation were recorded in a structured

100     questionnaire for each individual. Symptoms (presence or absence) include

101     anosmia, dysgeusia, arthralgia, headache, confusion, seizures, diarrhea, dyspnea,

102     abdominal pain, chest pain, low grade fever (37.5-37.9º Celsius), high grade fever

103     (≥38ºC), respiratory failure, conjunctival injection, irritability, malaise, myalgia, food

104     refusal, tachypnea, use of accessory muscles for breathing (UAMB), cough and

105     vomiting. Before May 18 the form included ‘odynophagia’ and ‘sore throat’. After

106     May 18 only odynophagia remained in the form. Therefore, all odynophagia

107     analyzes were performed considering the data from May 18 to May 24 (10225

108     individuals - 15 % of the entire dataset), the period of time where only odynophagia

109     was available in the questionnaire. We did not impose any further exclusion criteria

110     to limit selection bias. This study is reported as per the Strengthening the Reporting

111     of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines (S1 STROBE

112     Checklist, Supporting material).

113     Diagnosis by RT-PCR


114     The diagnosis by RT-PCR was used as a reference standard for the design of the

115     regression model. All kits for use in Argentina were approved by the Administración

116     Nacional de Medicamentos, Alimentos y Tecnología Médica. A fluid sample was

117     taken with a swab from each nostril and pharynx. From these samples, an RNA

118     extraction was performed for the subsequent RT-PCR.

119     Data analysis.


120     Symptoms of COVID-19 have been reported to differ in different age groups (6),

121     therefore two age categories were used for the analysis. A group with ages from 0

122     to 55 years (<56 group, n = 48748) and another group with ages 56 to 103 years-

123     old (≥56 group, n = 18570). The association of symptoms (presence versus

124     absence) and sex (male versus female) with a RT-PCR positive result for SARS-

125     CoV-2 was studied using multivariate logistic regression analysis considering

126     pairwise interactions, in both age groups. The effect of the different covariates was

127     quantified by the odds ratio values and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals

128     obtained by logistic regression.


129     Predictive models

130     We developed and tested different models aimed to improve the identification of

131     suspected cases; with the premise that such models should have the fewest

132     significant variables and symptoms that could be collected without the need for a

133     physical exam and laboratory testing (e.g. respiratory failure). Odynophagia was

134     excluded from the model design because this symptom alone (that is, without the


                                                                                                                                   7

135     option ‘sore throat’) was recorded only for 10225 individuals, and the exclusion of

136     this symptom did not produce a loss of the predictive capacity of the models.


137     To develop and test the models, the database (n=67318) was randomly divided

138     into two data sets (Training and Testing datasets) with the same percentage of RT-

139     PCR positive cases in each one. The Training set (n=53854) was used for the

140     design and internal validation of the models, while the Testing set (n=13464) was

141     used for external validation and evaluation of the predictive capacity of the model.

142     Models were compared using the Akaike Information Criterion, the area under the

143     receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) and the predictive value.


144     The best model was chosen through stepwise regression with bidirectional

145     elimination based on AIC. In addition, we performed a 100-fold cross-validation

146     method in which the training base is partitioned in 100 randomly selected subsets

147     and the model is fitted for each one. All statistical analyzes were performed with R

148     (7), and GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows (La Jolla California USA,

149     www.graphpad.com).

150     Results


151     Data description

152     A total of 67318 individuals were included in this study; among them, 12% had a

153     positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 with a median of 37 years-old (IQR: 26-51),

154     while the group with a negative RT-PCR had a median of 40 years-old (IQR: 25-

155     59). Infection rates varied in different age groups, showing the highest rates in the

156     15 to 60 years-old group (Figure 1).

157     Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 infection in relation to age

158     Significant differences were identified in the positivity rate of RT-PCR according to

159     the interval between the onset of symptoms and the time of sampling. It was

160     observed that for the day ranges of 0-3, 4-15 and 16-30 the proportion of positives

161     was 10.8, 13.7 and 8.6% respectively. Between the three intervals of days a

162     significant difference was observed (p <0.01).


163     The <56 group (n = 48748) presented a median age of 32 (IQR: 20-42), where

164     48% were male and 52% female while the median age for the ≥56 group

165     (n=18570) was 72 (IQR: 63-81, 52% male and 48% female).


166     The most frequent symptoms for each age group were independent of the RT-PCR

167     result (Figure 2). For the <56 group the most frequently observed symptoms were

168     high-grade fever, cough, odynophagia, malaise and headache. For the ≥56 group

169     the most frequent symptoms were high-grade fever, cough, tachypnea,

170     odynophagia and malaise. However, the symptoms with the highest proportion of a

171     confirmatory RT-PCR result were anosmia, dysgeusia, low grade fever,

                                                                                                                                   9

183     The association between sex, symptoms and infection with SARS-CoV-2 was

184     studied using logistic regression analysis considering pairwise interactions (see

185     supporting material for details). The odd ratios obtained for each of the symptoms

186     evaluated are displayed in Figure 4 for both age-groups. Sex was significant only

187     for the <56 group with males appearing with higher odds than females (OR =1.23

188     (IC 95%: 1.07,1.40)).

189     Figure 4: Odd ratios (OR) of SARS-CoV-2 infection corresponding to the presence of

190     symptoms for (a) <56 group and (b) ≥56 group. In green statistically significant ORs

191     (p <0.05) and in gray non-significant ORs (p> 0.05). For odynophagia, the

192     analyzed database is restricted to 10255 individuals.

193     In the <56 group the symptoms with a positive association with COVID-19 were

194     anosmia, dysgeusia, headache, low grade fever and cough; while UAMB,

195     tachypnea, conjunctival injection, vomiting, abdominal pain, odynophagia and high

196     grade fever have a negative association. The rest of the symptoms did not show

197     statistical significant association with COVID-19, but some of them have a

198     significant interaction with other symptoms (S2 Table, Supporting material).

199     Significantly higher ORs were found with the combination of anosmia and

200     dysgeusia (OR=19.84), anosmia and conjunctival injection (OR=17.40), anosmia

201     and cough (OR=9.73) and anosmia and malaise (OR=6.14).

202     For the ≥56 group, symptoms at presentation with positive association with COVID-

203     19 were anosmia, disgeusia, low grade fever and cough, while vomiting,

204     respiratory failure, food refusal, chest pain, tachypnea and dyspnea presented

205     negative association. Other symptoms did not show statistically significant

206     association with COVID-19, but as in the previous case, some have significant

207     interactions (S3 Table, Supporting material). Significantly higher ORs were found

208     with the combination of low-grade fever and irritability (OR=14.32), and anosmia

209     and dysgeusia (OR=6.44).

211     We considered several different logistic models for the probability of SARS-CoV-2

212     infection:


213

214     where A depends of the set of symptoms considered and other variables like sex,

215     age or days since symptoms onset. All tested models presented similar

216     characteristics regarding area under the curve, AIC value and predictive value.

217     The model with lower AIC value (35029) considers 16 symptoms, sex and three

218     quantitative variables: age, age squared and the number of symptoms (NS) as

219     described in Table 1. Cross validation did not show significant differences between

220     the model calculated with the training set and 100 randomly chosen partitions.

221     The variable age square captures the behavior of the proportion of positive cases

222     with age (Figure 1). An alternative model without the variable age square is

223     described in the supporting material S4 Appendix. It can also be observed that the

224     number of symptoms has a negative contribution in the equation resulting in

225     decreases in the likelihood of COVID-19 infection as the number of symptoms

226     increases.

231     Discussion
232     The analysis of this large cohort allows an age-based characterization of the

233     symptoms associated with COVID-19 at presentation, in the search for an

234     improved clinical based decision strategy for the use of diagnostic tests and case

235     management. To interrupt the spread of SARS-CoV-2, early detection, isolation,

236     and the implementation of a robust system to trace contacts is required (WHO,

237     2020). Among the non-severe symptomatic cases, non-specific symptoms shared

238     with other acute upper-respiratory infections hamper proper case identification and

239     implementation of rapid isolation measures. In contrast to most acute upper-

240     respiratory infections (including many respiratory coronaviruses), COVID-19 poses

241     a special challenge in requiring specific identification for clinical and public health

242     management. To facilitate the early detection of patients with COVID-19, we

243     analyzed the symptoms of 67318 individuals studied with RT-PCR, of which 12%

244     had a positive test result.


245     The most frequently reported symptoms among case series of COVID-19 include

246     fever, cough, dyspnea and shortness of breath (8,9). Other symptoms include sore

247     throat, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, headache and confusion (8). We found

248     that in the present database the most frequent symptoms were cough, high-grade

249     fever, and odynophagia. However, more frequent symptoms not necessarily are

250     indicators of COVID-19. Our analysis revealed that the symptoms positively

251     associated with COVID-19 are anosmia, dysgeusia, low grade fever (37.5 to 38

252     ºC), cough and headache (the later only in the <56 group). Another group of

253     symptoms show a negative association with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2,


                                                                                                                                  14

254     therefore suggesting alternative diagnoses (Figure 3). Our analysis also revealed

255     that some symptoms interact with each other, modifying their ORs. In relation to

256     this, anosmia and dysgeusia were observed to have a significant and positive

257     interaction increasing the already high and positive OR of each of them. This is in

258     accordance with other authors stating that anosmia and dysgeusia have a positive

259     predictive value of 77% each of them and 83% if they are together (10). Although

260     anosmia can appear in other AURI, it has been suggested that the lack of

261     accompanying rhinitis or nasal swelling is more typically associated with COVID-19

262     (11); we were not able to test this hypothesis because the questionnaire does not

263     contain rhinitis as a variable. Another combined effect to be highlighted was

264     anosmia and conjunctival injection in the<56 age group and low-grade fever and

265     irritability in the elder group. These combinations showed ORs >14. Low grade

266     fever had a positive association with COVID-19 in both age groups, while high

267     grade fever (≥38ºC) showed a negative association in the <56 group and was not

268     significant in the ≥56 group.


269     In this study we also developed a model based on symptoms at presentation, sex

270     and age. In our database, patient`s age was found as a significant variable for

271     establishing correlations between symptoms and COVID-19. Although the age-

272     dependent variability in the proportion of RT-PCR positive results in our study

273     population might reflects differences in exposure due to school closure and an

274     active protection of the elder, the model achieves comparable predictive values in

275     all age groups. In view of the burden of morbidity and mortality in high risk groups,

276     models to predict the likelihood of infection should be interpreted with caution and


                                                                                                                                  15

277     not be used to limit the corresponding testing of groups at increased risk of severe

278     disease.

279     This study was conducted with patients diagnosed between April and May 2020,

280     prior to the influenza season in Argentina; this should also place our results in the

281     adequate context of the alternative diagnoses that could modify the specificity of

282     the symptoms based on the type and prevalence of these agents; in the current

283     case, with most cases occurring in Buenos Aires and its metropolitan area, this

284     same area was affected by its largest recorded dengue outbreak and a significant

285     reduction of influenza-like illnesses (12).


286     This study has limitations; the diagnostic test of choice, RT-PCR shows a

287     sensitivity of 56–83% (13); therefore, the sensitivity and specificity measures of the

288     model may lose precision. While suffering from the lack of a highly sensitive

289     diagnostic standard, identifying clinical characteristics that raise the pretest

290     probability of the infection could help interpretations of the RT-PCR result when

291     combined with predictive models, epidemiological factors and complementary

292     diagnostic methods like chest imaging (14). In our analysis, a significantly higher

293     probability of a positive RT-PCR was identified if the test was performed when the

294     interval between symptoms initiation and sampling was between 4 and 15 days.

295     Another limitation derives from the circumstance of the data collection, which has

296     not been design as a prospective research tool but rather as a surveillance system

297     with no monitoring system and therefore subject to errors in upload.

298     In summary, this symptoms-based analysis of a cohort tested for COVID-19

299     identified a group of symptoms (anosmia/dysgeusia, low-grade fever, cough and


                                                                                                                                  16

301     show that a regression model based on multiple factors (age, sex, interaction

302     between symptoms) could be used as a complementary method for the rapid

303     identification of possible COVID-19 cases and the necessary precautionary

304     measures.
