               Abstract
               Aims. To study 1) temporal trends and risk factors of opioid overdose and 2) properties
               underlying opioids with less overdose events.
               Design. A retrospective cross-sectional study.
               Setting. Inpatient setting in Cerner Health Facts®, a large-scale database for electronic
               health records in the United States.
               Participants. Patients admitted between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2017.
               Measurements. Opioid overdose prevalence by year, demographics and prescription opioid
               exposures.
               Findings. A total of 4,720,041 patients with 7,339,480 inpatient encounters were retrieved
               from Cerner Health Facts®. Among them, 30.2% patients were aged 65+, 57.0% female,
               70.1% Caucasian, 42.3% single, 32.0% from South and 80.8% in urban area.                    From 2009
               to 2017, annual opioid overdose prevalence per 1,000 patients significantly increased from
               3.7 to 11.9 with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI):
               [1.15-1.16]. Comparing to the major demographic counterparts above, being in 1) age
               group: 41-50 or 51-64, 2) marital status: divorced, 3) census region: West, were
               significantly associated with higher odds of opioid overdose. Prescription opioid exposures
               were also associated with increased odds of opioid overdose, such as meperidine (overall
               aOR 1.09, 95% CI: [1.06-1.13]) and tramadol (overall aOR 2.20, 95% CI: [2.14-2.27]).
               Examination on the relationships between opioid agonists’ properties and their association
               strengths, aORs, in opioid overdose showed that lower aORs values were significantly
                                                                       2

               associated with 1) high molecular weight, 2) negative interaction with multi-drug resistance
               protein 1 or positive interaction with cytochrome P450 3A4 and 3) negative interaction with
               delta opioid receptor or kappa opioid receptor.
               Conclusions. The significant increasing trends of opioid overdose from 2009 to 2017 and
               the risk factors indicated an ongoing need for targeted interventions to combat the opioid
               overdose epidemic. There are physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
               properties underlying opioid agonists with less overdose events, which can be utilized to
               develop better opioids.

               Introduction
               Over the past two decades, drug overdose has been a leading cause of injury-related deaths
               in the United States (US), of which 70% involved illicit or prescription opioids 1.
               Prescription opioids are among the most effective drugs to treat pain, which are ligands to
               the endogenous mu opioid receptor (MOR) and can exert agonistic, partially agonistic or
               antagonistic effect 2. When activated by agonists, MOR can mediate analgesic effects as
               well as modulate respiratory responses 3. However, lethal respiratory depression can happen
               in case of overdose 4. In 2018, opioid overdose was attributed to 47,761 deaths, which
               imposed an enormous public health burden on the US 5,6. The epidemic of opioid overdose
               is dynamic and complex 7,8. As opined by Jalal et al, the current epidemic can be a recent
               manifestation of an ongoing longer-term process 8. Close monitoring the temporal trends of
               opioid overdose is, therefore, crucial for developing and evaluating relevant policies to
               prevent and control the epidemic 8-12. Furthermore, despite the complexity of the opioid
               overdose epidemic, there exist some patterns on patient demographics and opioid
               prescriptions, which can provide essential knowledge for the planning of effective
               prevention measures 12-15.
               By now, various guidelines and programs have already been launched to curb opioid
               prescribing 16-18. Notwithstanding the lethal respiratory depression effect, opioids are still
               among the most commonly prescribed medications, presumably due to that pain is the one
               of most common reasons for patients to visit their doctors 19,20. To combat the overdose
               epidemic, better opioid agonists with reduced overdose effects are indisputably needed 21.
                                                                       4

               Novel treatments have been proposed based on optimizing their innate properties. For
               example, one selective MOR agonist was shown to be both effective for analgesia and
               devoid of respiratory depression 22. Another MOR agonist was also reported to have low
               abuse potential due to a reduced rate of entry across the blood brain barrier (BBB) 23.
               Nonetheless, whether these new chemical entities will eventually work in human subjects
               remains unclear yet 21. In fact, new drug development is well known for its low success rate
               24
                  . Thus, given the severity and urgency of the opioid overdose epidemic, early-stage
               optimization strategies for the lead compounds are the key to successfully bring better
               opioids into clinical use, which include physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and
               pharmacodynamic aspects 25.
               Recently, real-world data (RWD), such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), has received
               substantial attention for large-scale drug safety study 26. Real-world evidence (RWE)
               generated from RWD holds high potential to guide drug discovery and subsequent drug
               development 27,28. In the case of opioid overdose, the fundamental question would be “What
               are the optimal properties underlying opioids with less overdose effects?”. The properties
               associated with less overdose events in a large human population can serve as the valid
               target product profiles to clearly define the desired attributes during early drug discovery,
               thereby maximizing the success rate of better opioid agonists eventually getting approved 29.
               Hence, in this large-scale observational study on opioid overdose, we firstly examined the
               temporal trends of opioid overdose and its risk factors, including patient demographics and
               prescription opioid exposures based on a large-scale EHRs database. Secondly, we
                                                                       5

               examined opioid agonists’ relevant properties underlying lower association strengths in
               opioid overdose so as to generate RWEs on optimal properties for better opioids with less
               overdose events.
               Methods
               Data and Measurements
               This retrospective cross-sectional study was based on Cerner Health Facts®, one of the
               largest EHRs databases in the United States. Health Facts® stores real-world, de-identified
               patient data, such as records on encounters, diagnoses and medications, from over 600
               healthcare facilities. A recent study showed that Health Facts® and the Healthcare Cost and
               Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample have similar distribution across all data
               elements 30.
               For the assembly of our study dataset, we retrieved patients at the inpatient care setting
               admitted between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2017. To identify patients with opioid
               overdose, we used the International Classification of Diseases codes, Ninth Revision
               (ICD-9) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10), for poisoning or adverse effect by opium, heroin,
               methadone, other related narcotics, etc (Supporting Information, Table S1) 31. Patients with
               at least one relevant diagnosis code in all inpatient encounters within a year were added to
               the opioid overdose cohort in that year. Other independent variables are described as
               follows.
               Demographics
               We measured patient demographics, including age group (<18, 18-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-64,
               65+), gender (female, male), race/ethnicity (African American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic,
                                                                       6

               Native American, others), marital status (divorced, married, single, widowed, others),
               census region (Midwest, Northeast, South, West) and urbanicity (rural, urban). For patients
               with varied demographics, such as migration between rural and urban areas, records from
               their first encounter were used.
               Prescription Opioids
               For prescription opioids, we categorized them by their action types on MOR 2, namely, 1)
               opioid agonists: codeine, fentanyl and morphine, among others, 2) opioid partial agonists:
               buprenorphine, butorphanol and nalbuphine, and 3) opioid antagonist: naloxone. For each
               category, we collected the corresponding FDA-approved active ingredients from DrugBank
               5.1.6, which were then mapped to medications containing the active ingredients in Health
               Facts® 32. Illicit opioids and opioids withdrawn from market were excluded, such as
               diamorphine and propoxyphene. To ensure sufficient statistical significance, prescription
               opioids with annual prevalence less than 1‰ were also excluded from analyses, such as
               dihydrocodeine, naltrexone and pentazocine. Medications in all inpatient encounters within
               one year were aggregated and a patient was defined as exposed if medications containing
               the active ingredient were prescribed in that year, otherwise as non-exposed.
               For prescription opioids’ innate properties, they were also collected from DrugBank 5.1.6 32,
               including, 1) physicochemical properties underlying BBB permeability: lipophilicity (logP),
               polar surface area (PSA) and molecular weight (MW) 33, 2) pharmacokinetic interaction
               with efflux transporters and metabolizing enzymes: multi-drug resistance protein 1 (MDR1),
               cytochromes P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and 3A4 (CYP3A4) 34-36, and 3) pharmacodynamic
               interaction with receptors: delta opioid receptor (DOR), kappa opioid receptor (KOR) and
                                                                       7

               Statistical analyses
               Demographic characteristics were determined using descriptive analyses. Proportions of
               opioid overdose, i.e., opioid overdose prevalence, among all patients and patient subgroups
               divided by demographics, were calculated on a yearly basis.
               Inferential analyses were conducted to examine the temporal trends of opioid overdose and
               risk factors by calculating the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals
               (CIs). Firstly, for each patient subgroup stratified by demographics, multivariable logistic
               regression was used with 1) the inclusion of whether a patient was diagnosed as opioid
               overdose within a year as the dependent variable, and 2) year and a demographic factor as
               independent variables plus an interaction item between the two independent variables to
               examine the temporal trends, further adjusted for all demographics (e.g., age_group, gender,
               race/ethnicity, marital status, census region and rural/urban area). Secondly, for risk factors,
               including demographics and prescription opioid exposures, multivariable logistic regression
               adjusted for all demographics was also performed based on both data in each year for the
               yearly aORs and data across all years for the overall aORs. For demographics, age group in
               65+, gender as female, race/ethnicity as Caucasian, marital status as single, census region in
               south and urban area were set as the reference. For prescription opioid exposures, the
               non-exposed was set as the reference.
               To examine the relationship between MOR agonists’ innate properties and their aORs (i.e.,
               association strengths) in opioid overdose, power analysis was conducted to only exploit
                                                                       8

               aORs with statistical power greater than 80% 38,39. For continuous physicochemical
               properties, we first discretized them into two groups, low or high, with median as the cutoff.
               Then, Wilcoxon test was used to examine the relationship between aORs of opioid agonists
               and their attributes in the physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects.
               Dataset was processed in Python 3.7.3. Statistical analyses were conducted in R 3.6.1,
               packages: “stats”, “epiR”. All data analyses were performed between Feb 1, 2020 and Sept
               1, 2020.
               Results
               Patient Characteristics
               Between 2009 and 2017, a total of 7,339,480 inpatient encounters for 4,720,041 patients
               were retrieved from Health Facts®. Among them, 1,423,744 (30.2%) patients were in the
               65+ age group, 2,689,898 (57.0%) patients were female, 3,310,471 (70.1%) patients were
               Caucasian, 1,995,380 patients (42.3%) were single, 1,511,746 patients (32.0%) were from
               South and 3,813,817 patients (80.8%) were in urban area. Encounter counts for patients
               were summarized in Supporting Information, Figure S1.
               Temporal Trends of Opioid Overdose
               Annual opioid overdose prevalence from 2009 to 2017 stratified by demographics was
               detailed in Table 1. There were significant increasing trends of opioid overdose. From 2009
               to 2017, the overall opioid overdose prevalence increased from 3.7‰ to 11.9‰ (3.2-fold
               increase; aOR: 1.16, 95% CI: [1.15-1.16]; p < 0.0001). The increasing trends in all patient
               subgroups were also significant. Among them, patient subgroup from South had a 6.3-fold

               Asian patients (5.2-fold increase: from 1.2‰ to 6.0‰; aOR: 1.20, 95% CI: [1.14-1.27]; p <
               0.0001), African American patients (4.8-fold increase: from 2.2‰ to 10.8‰; aOR: 1.20, 95%
               CI: [1.19-1.22]; p < 0.0001) and patients in rural area (4.2-fold increase: from 2.1‰ to
               8.8‰; aOR: 1.14, 95% CI [1.13-1.16]; p < 0.0001). These prominent trends indicated that
               prevention and control measures of opioid overdose at the US inpatient care setting had
               been be inadequate over the years.
               Demographics as Risk Factors for Opioid Overdose
               Demographics as risk factors for opioid overdose were summarized in Table 2. Compared to
               patients aged 65+, patients aged 41-50 (overall aOR: 1.36, 95% CI [1.31-1.40]; p < 0.0001)
               or 51-64 (overall aOR: 1.35, 95% CI [1.32-1.39]; p < 0.0001) had higher odds of opioid
               overdose whereas patients aged <18 (overall aOR: 0.18, 95% CI [0.17-0.19]; p < 0.0001) or
               18-30 (overall aOR: 0.74, 95% CI [0.71-0.76]; p < 0.0001) had much lower odds. When
               comparing to single patients, patients who were divorced (overall aOR: 1.19, 95% CI
               [1.15-1.23]; p < 0.0001) had higher odds of opioid overdose whereas the odds were lower
               for patients who were married (overall aOR: 0.73, 95% CI [0.71-0.75]; p < 0.0001) or
               widowed (overall aOR: 0.89, 95% CI [0.86-0.93]; p < 0.0001). For patients in rural area
               (overall aOR: 0.84, 95% CI [0.82-0.86]; p < 0.0001), their odds of opioid overdose were
               lower than patients in urban area. Note that the yearly aORs were also varying. For example,
               across all years, male patients (overall aOR: 0.98, 95% CI [0.96-1.00]; p = 0.05) had
               comparable odds with female patients. However, male patients were more likely to have
                                                                       10

               opioid overdose in 2009 whereas they became comparably or less likely to have it in
               subsequent years. Similarly, patients from Midwest, Northeast or West census regions also
               exhibited varying aORs of opioid overdose from 2009 to 2017, which partially reflected the
               changing dynamics of the opioid overdose epidemic 8.
               Prescription Opioid Exposures as Risk Factors for Opioid Overdose
               Prescription opioids included for evaluation were listed in Table 3, along with their relevant
               properties and the overall prevalence between 2009 and 2017. Prescription opioid exposures
               as risk factors for opioid overdose were detailed in Table 4. Among MOR agonists,
               morphine (342.1‰) was most frequently prescribed, followed by fentanyl (297.5‰),
               oxycodone (263.3‰), hydromorphone (242.1‰) and hydrocodone (182.4‰), the high
               usage rates of which manifested the prescription opioid abuse 40. The MOR antagonist,
               naloxone (157.8‰), was also commonly prescribed and compared to the non-exposed
               patients, patients exposed to naloxone (overall aOR: 3.24, 95% CI [3.18-3.31]; p < 0.0001)
               had a higher odds of opioid overdose, presumably due to its therapeutic effect to reverse
               overdose 3.
               For MOR partial agonists, buprenorphine (3.2‰) was less frequently prescribed than
               nalbuphine (45.7‰) and butorphanol (29.5‰). Besides, exposures to partial agonists,
               nalbuphine (overall aOR: 0.565, 95% CI [0.53-0.60]; p < 0.0001) and butorphanol (aOR:
               0.09, 95% CI [0.07 - 0.11]; p < 0.0001), were associated with reduced odds of overdose
               whereas buprenorphine (overall aOR: 2.89, 95% CI [2.63-3.19]; p < 0.0001) was positively
               associated with opioid overdose. This could be explained by that buprenorphine is for
                                                                       11

               medication assisted treatment (MAT), which is closely related to opioid overdose 41.
               Exposures to opioid agonists were also positively associated with opioid overdose except
               for codeine (overall aOR: 0.78, 95% CI [0.74-0.83]; p < 0.0001), consistent with a previous
               finding that codeine had lowest risk for severe respiratory depression 13. Moreover, different
               opioid agonists posed unique aORs, reflecting varied association strengths in opioid
               overdose.
               Optimal Properties for Better Opioid Agonists
               To explore the optimal properties underlying better opioid agonists with less overdose
               effects, we examined the relationships between their relevant properties (Table 3) and the
               yearly aORs of opioid agonists (Table 4), depicted in Figure 1. Note that opioid agonists
               targeting for peripheral MORs, namely loperamide and diphenoxylate, and methadone for
               MAT purpose, were excluded 41,42. For the physicochemical properties, lower aORs, i.e.,
               weakened association strengths, were observed for opioid agonists with high MW (median
               decreased from 1.62 to 1.24; p < 0.001). The interpretation is that when an opioid agonist’s
               MW is high, its association with opioid overdose would be weakened, possibly due to
               reduced BBB permeability 33. For logP (median decreased from 1.49 to 1.40; p = 0.2) and
               PSA (median increased from 1.25 to 1.60; p = 0.45), no significant associations were
               observed.
               From the pharmacokinetic perspective, a negative interaction with MDR1 was associated
               with lower aORs (median decreased from 1.51 to 1.25; p < 0.05), which indicates that if an
               opioid agonist does not interact with MDR1, its association strength with opioid overdose
                                                                       12

               would be lowered. This could be due to that an interaction between opioids and MDR1 at
               the BBB can up-regulate the expression of MDR1, which leads to opioid tolerance, abuse,
               dependence and eventually overdose 43,44. For the interaction with CYP3A4, a positive
               interaction was associated with lower aORs (median decreased from 1.79 to 1.32; p < 0.01),
               which suggests that CYP3A4 metabolism may be protective for opioid agonists from
               overdose as a result of reduced bioavailability during first-pass metabolism 35. From the
               pharmacodynamic perspective, lower aORs were observed when opioid agonists do not
               interact with DOR (median decreased from 1.52 to 1.13; p < 0.01) or KOR (median
               decreased from 1.53 to 1.23; p = 0.07). The interpretation is that when opioid agonists are
               selective towards MOR, overdose events would be reduced. For NMDAR (median
               increased from 1.36 to 1.69; p = 0.16), no significant difference in aORs was observed.
               Discussion
               An Ongoing Need for Targeted Overdose Prevention
               In this study, we found that opioid overdose increased significantly at the US inpatient care
               setting from 2009 to 2017. As pointed out by Danovitch et al, inpatient opioid overdose is a
               serious harm, yet preventable, and is likely to be underestimated in much of current
               literature 45. The significant increasing trends observed from Health Facts®, a large-scale
               EHRs database, indicated that prevention and control measures for opioid overdose had
               been inadequate at the US inpatient setting over these years, especially for patient
               subgroups with prominent fold increases, such as patients from South and patients in rural
               area.
                                                                       13

               We also quantified how patient demographics were associated with inpatient opioid
               overdose and found that certain demographics increased the odds of opioid overdose. For
               instance, compared to the major demographic counterpart age 65+, patients aged 51-64 and
               41-50 were more likely to have opioid overdose, which was partly consistent with a recent
               Mortality Disparities in American Communities study, where patients aged 40-59 were
               attributed to the most part of opioid overdose deaths from 2008 to 2015 46. Patients in urban
               area had higher odds of opioid overdose than those in rural area, which reflected the
               urbanicity of the opioid overdose epidemic 46. The associated risk factors suggest the need
               for targeted measures in patient subgroups at higher risk.
               A Necessity to Differentiate Prescription Opioids
               In addition to patient demographics, prescription opioid exposures were also evaluated as
               risk factors. Our study showed that prescription opioids were commonly prescribed. For
               instance, 342.1‰ patients were prescribed with medications containing morphine, the high
               prevalence of which manifested inappropriate opioid prescribing practice and, eventually,
               prevalent opioid overdose 47. Previous studies showed that opioid overdose was associated
               with opioid prescription patterns, such as dosage and duration 48-51. Yet, measures to reduce
               prescription opioids supply alone may not be enough to combat the opioid crisis 52.
               In current literature, prescription opioids were usually aggregated for the morphine
               milligram equivalents (MME) calculation, a widely adopted metric 16-18. One potential
               misconception arising from MME is that all opioids are interchangeable, which can falsely
               justify the transitioning of one opioid to other “equivalent” opioids 53,54. A previous study
                                                                       14

               based on a cohort of 307 patients showed that some prescription opioids were associated
               with a much higher risk for severe respiratory depression than others 13. For example,
               fentanyl had 20-fold higher relative risk compared to codeine, the lowest-risk opioid. In fact,
               a wide range of differences exist among prescription opioids. For instance, during
               distribution to the site of action, i.e., MOR in the central nervous system, they exhibit varied
               BBB permeability 55. Besides, opioids also have disparate binding profiles to the opioid
               receptors 56,57. Our study revealed varied associations with opioid overdose for different
               prescription opioids, indicating a necessity to differentiate prescription opioids in opioid
               prescribing practice 13.
               Real-World Evidence on Optimal Properties for Better Opioids
               Given the foreseeable continuing trends of opioid overdose in the US and the high
               prevalence of prescription opioids for pain, there is an undisputed need to develop better
               opioids with less overdose effects. Our study generated RWEs on optimal properties for
               better opioid agonists. For instance, from the physicochemical perspective, opioid agonists
               with low MW had significantly higher association strengths with opioid overdose, possibly
               due to increased BBB permeability. From pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
               perspectives, when opioid agonists interact with MDR1, DOR or KOR, the association
               strengths in opioid overdose were significantly increased. Thus, the interactions with the
               efflux transporter and other opioid receptors should be taken into consideration during early
               drug discovery for better opioid agonists. Although some optimal properties have been
               proposed before, they were mostly based on preclinical studies and there still lacks a clear
                                                                       15

               link to the safety profiles in human. With the emergence of artificial intelligence in drug
               discovery, molecule structure design biased towards pre-defined attributes has become a
               reality 58,59. The RWEs on the optimal properties for opioids with less overdose effects can
               function as actionable knowledge to develop better opioids 26.
               Limitations
               Our study also had some limitations. Firstly, we only used ICD-9 /ICD-10 codes to identify
               patients with opioid overdose, which may not be fully accurate 60,61. Besides, there was a
               transition of ICD-9 codes to ICD-10 codes in 2015, which can lead to discontinuities in the
               opioid overdose trends 62. Secondly, we only focused on patient demographics and
               prescription opioid exposures as risk factors for opioid overdose. Other potential risk factors
               like comorbidities and surgery procedures were not examined yet 63,64. In addition, opioid
               prescription patterns including dosage and duration also need further assessment. Thirdly,
               because of the observational study design, where we did not strictly distinguish the temporal
               order of being prescribed with a medication and getting diagnosed as opioid overdose, the
               association strengths, thus, may not necessarily represent causality. Lastly, our study was
               based on a single database. Exploitation on other RWD sources would also be needed.
               Nevertheless, despite the limitations, we conducted a comprehensive study on opioid
               overdose through investigating its patterns and generating RWEs on the optimal properties
               for better opioids, which provided critical knowledge to combat the opioid overdose
               epidemic.

               Conclusions
               A retrospective observational study was conducted using a large-scale EHRs database to
               examine the opioid overdose patterns, including temporal trends and associated risk factors.
               The significant increasing trends of opioid overdose from 2009 to 2017 indicated that
               prevention and control measures for opioid overdose had been inadequate at the US
               inpatient care setting. Besides, patient demographics and prescription opioid exposures were
               associated with higher odds of opioid overdose, suggesting that targeted prevention and
               control measures are needed. Furthermore, there are optimal properties underlying opioid
               agonists with reduced overdose effects, which hold great potential for the development of
               better opioids.

a: Prescription opioids are categorized by their action on opioid mu receptor (MOR), ordered by their overall prevalence. b: Relevant physicochemical
properties include lipophilicity (logP), polar surface area (PSA) and molecular weight (MW). c: Relevant pharmacokinetic properties focus on whether the
opioid interacts with 1) drug efflux transporter, multi-drug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) 2) metabolizing enzymes, cytochromes P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and 3A4
(CYP3A4). d: Relevant pharmacodynamic properties focus on whether the opioid interacts with 1) other opioid receptors, delta opioid receptor (DOR) and
kappa opioid receptor (KOR) 2) non-opioid receptor in modulating opioid analgesia, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). N.A. = Not Applicable.
