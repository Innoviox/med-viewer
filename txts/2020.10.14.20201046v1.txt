    Abstract
    Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is a treatable cause of heart failure with a
    hereditary form that disproportionally affects patients of West African ancestry. The
    clinical management of ATTR-CA has dramatically changed in the past five years, with
    rapidly evolving diagnostic approaches and life-prolonging therapies. The TTR variant
    c.424G>A, p.V142I (aka V122I) is pathogenic and occurs in 3-4% of individuals of West
    African ancestry. Despite its high frequency, V142I ATTR-CA is often unrecognized due
    to variable clinical penetrance, limited knowledge, and lack of inexpensive non-invasive
    diagnostic tests. Currently unknown is which TTR V142I carriers will progress to heart
    failure and at what age. Here we studied the prevalence of TTR V142I among a random
    cohort of African-American patients enrolled in the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac
    Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial (TOPCAT). Three of the 26
    HFpEF patients (11.5%) studied carried the pathogenic TTR V142I variant. While we
    cannot conclude at this point that TTR V142I was the underlying cause of the clinical
    phenotype in these patients, our results suggest that rapid TTR V142I genotyping, in
    combination with heart imaging, could have immediate clinical utility for identifying
    under-/mis-diagnosed HFpEF patients.

    Introduction
    Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is an increasingly recognized cause of left
    ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. Pathogenic DNA variants in the TTR gene
    confer an autosomal dominant risk for ATTR, with clinical manifestations that precede
    diagnosis often by years[1]. One of the most frequent pathogenic TTR variants
    (c.424G>A, p.V142I, also notated as V122I) occurs almost exclusively in individuals of
    West African descent[2]. An estimated 1.5 million African Americans (3.4%) in the
    United States are heterozygous for TTR V142I[2]. Heart failure with preserved ejection
    fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous clinical phenotype that accounts for approximately
    half of newly diagnosed cases of heart failure in the US per year and for which there are
    currently no evidence based medical therapies. Recent studies suggested that ATTR
    cardiomyopathy prevalence amongst HFpEF patients is much higher than previously
    thought, due to under-recognition[2, 3]. This has important implications for HFpEF
    clinical trials as treatment effects are likely to differ between idiopathic and ATTR-
    related HFpEF. Here we describe our investigation of the prevalence of TTR V142I
    among a random cohort of African-American patients enrolled in the Treatment of
    Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial
    (TOPCAT)[4].
    Material and Methods
    We requested all available trial data and de-identified DNA samples from patients
    enrolled in TOPCAT who self-identified as black from the BIOLINCC repository. TTR
    gene variants were identified using clinical exome sequencing and confirmed using
    bidirectional Sanger sequencing. The genetic findings were correlated with clinical
    outcome data for each subject. All but one of the samples originated from US sites. This
    study was overseen by the institutional review board at Yale University.
    Results
    The BIOLINCC repository was able to provide biospecimens with extractable DNA for
    only 26 TOPCAT black subjects, possibly due to elapsed time from the TOPCAT trial.
    Three of 26 HFpEF patients studied carried the pathogenic TTR V142I variant (Table 1).

    The enrichment of TTR V142I in this cohort of HFpEF patients (11.5%) was increased
    compared to the general African-American population (3.4%). Analysis of trial data
    showed that all three subjects positive for TTR V142I were assigned in the placebo
    group, and two out of three patients (66%) reached the primary end-point (composite of
    death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the
    management of heart failure). In comparison, of the 302 black TOPCAT patients for
    whom trial data were available, 34.4% (n=104) reached the primary end-point.
    Discussion
    We found a significant proportion of African-American HFpEF subjects (11.5%) carried
    the TTR V142I variant in this random sample from TOPCAT, in spite of efforts to
    specifically exclude infiltrative cardiomyopathy at the point of enrollment[4]. While we
    cannot say for certain, it is possible that these three patients suffered from HFpEF
    driven by ATTR-CA at the time of enrollment. ATTR-CA runs an insipid course, with
    TTR amyloid tissue deposition often preceding heart failure diagnosis by years[1, 2].
    Our findings are consistent with prior findings suggesting that ATTR-CA can be missed
    even after current approaches to strict clinical trial screening. Our sample cohort was
    significantly enriched in females, for unknown reasons. This could potentially alter
    patients’ clinical characteristics, as inherited ATTR-CA often expresses at a later age in
    females. Whether enrolling unidentified ATTR-CA patients in clinical HFpEF trials
    adversely affects our ability to identify effective treatments is a relevant question.
    There has been a series of negative HFpEF trials over the years leading to near
    complete absence of effective medical treatment for HFpEF. Could it be possible that
    occult ATTR-CA has been one of the drivers of the extended HFpEF therapy drought?
    That depends on whether we believe that ATTR-CA patients would have a different
    response to medical therapy than “run-of-the-mill” HFpEF. There is general agreement
    that angiotensin pathway modification and beta-blockade are at best ineffective and at
    worst counterproductive in the treatment of patients with ATTR-CA. Whether
    aldosterone receptor antagonists (studied in TOPCAT) react differently is at present
    impossible to say. In any event, ATTR screening was not part of previous studies and

    merits consideration for HFpEF and, potentially, even HFrEF[5] clinical trials going
    forward. For populations shown to be enriched with ATTR (African-Americans middle-
    aged or older, or elderly men regardless of race with HFpEF) we would contend that it is
    worthwhile to explore point-of-care diagnostic strategies, employing 99mTc-
    pyrophosphate (PYP) cardiac scanning and/or rapid TTR V142I genetic testing when
    enrolling for clinical trials for HFpEF.
