    ABSTRACT
    As many inflammatory and metabolic disorders have been associated with structural deficits of
    the human gut microbiota, the principles and mechanisms that govern its initialization and
    development are of considerable scientific interest and clinical relevance. However, our current
    understanding of the developing gut microbiota dynamics remains incomplete. We carried out a
    large-scale, comprehensive meta-analysis of over 1900 available metagenomic shotgun samples
    from neonates, infants, adolescents, and their families, using our recently introduced SameStr
    program for strain-level microbiota profiling and the detection of microbial strain transfer and
    persistence. We found robust associations between gut microbiota composition and age, as well
    as delivery mode which was measurable for up to two years of life. C-section was associated with
    increased relative abundances of non-gut species and delayed transition from a predominantly
    oxygen-tolerant to intolerant microbial community. Unsupervised networks based on shared strain
    profiles generated family-specific clusters connecting infants, their siblings, parents and
    grandparents and, in one case, suggested strain transfer between neonates from the same
    hospital ward, but could also be used to identify potentially mislabeled metagenome samples.
    Following birth, larger quantities of strains were shared between vaginally born infants and their
    mothers compared to C-section infants, which further persisted throughout the first year of life
    and belonged to the same bacterial species as strains that were shared between adults and their
    parents. Irrespective of delivery type, older children shared strains with their mothers and fathers
    and, into adulthood, could be accurately distinguished from unrelated sample pairs. Prominent
    gut commensal bacteria were both among frequently transferred (e.g. Bacteroides and Sutterella)
    and newly acquired taxa (e.g. Blautia, Faecalibacterium, and Ruminococcus). Our meta-analysis
    presents a more detailed and comprehensive picture of the highly dynamic neonatal and infant
    gut microbiota development than previous studies and presents evidence for taxonomic and
    functional compositional differences early in life between infants born naturally or by C-section,
    which persist well into adolescence.

    INTRODUCTION
    The taxonomic composition of the human microbiota is highly individual, with variations between
    individuals far exceeding those observed within one person over time (Costello et al., 2009).
    Although there is an ongoing controversy around prenatal microbiota exposure during pregnancy
    (Hornef and Penders, 2017), microbial colonization is generally believed to begin at birth. Birth
    type, i.e. vaginal delivery or Cesarean section (Blaser and Dominguez-Bello, 2016), and
    influences during the first weeks and months after birth, i.e. breastmilk or formula feeding
    (Bokulich et al., 2016), antibiotic or other medications (Cho and Blaser, 2012), exposure to family
    members (Korpela et al., 2018), rural or urban environments (Zuo et al., 2018), etc. have all been
    associated with compositional changes of the microbiota, resulting in the establishment of
    individualized and stable microbiota profiles by the age of 2-3 years (Cho and Blaser, 2012).
    Correspondingly, disruptive influences on early-life microbial exposure, such as C-section or
    microbiota depletion by antibiotic treatment, increase the risks for inflammatory and metabolic
    disorders (Mueller et al., 2015; Torow and Hornef, 2017).
    Maternal microbiota transfer during vaginal birth has received considerable attention in the
    scientific literature (Stinson et al., 2018): Several highly cited studies reported an enrichment of
    the neonatal gut microbiota for skin and environmental bacteria in infants born by C-section as
    opposed to a taxonomic microbiota composition in naturally born infants, which resembled that of
    the vaginal microbiota (Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010; Reyman et al., 2019; Shin et al., 2015).
    Accordingly, retroactive colonization of the neonate with bacteria from the vaginal microbiota of
    the mother has been proposed to remediate potential microbiota deficits in infants born by C-
    section (Dominguez-Bello et al., 2016). However, this practice remains controversial, as it carries
    the risk of transferring (opportunistic) pathogens to the newborn and health benefits from this
    treatment have not been proven (Cunnington et al., 2016). Importantly, our understanding of the
    neonatal microbiota acquisition process has still many gaps, as the most commonly applied
    method for compositional microbiota analysis, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, does not
    provide sufficient resolution to track specific maternal or environmental strains in the neonatal
    microbiota. Recently, new bioinformatics tools have been applied for the differentiation of
    microbial subspecies lineages in the neonate, based on the detection of phylogenetic sequence
    variations in metagenomic shotgun sequence data (Ferretti et al., 2018; Korpela et al., 2018; Shao
    et al., 2019; Yassour et al., 2018). However, as these methods vary in sensitivity and specificity
    (Van Rossum et al., 2020) and most studies have only focused on the characterization of the
    early-life gut microbiota within the first year of life, the resulting findings remain difficult to compare
    and do not provide much insight into the long-term persistence of maternally transferred microbes
    in the infant, child and adolescent.
    We sought to expand on previous studies by carrying out a large-scale, comprehensive meta-
    analysis of available metagenomic sequence data from neonates, infants and adolescents, their
    siblings, mothers and fathers and, in some cases, even grandparents. We used our recently
    introduced SameStr program (Podlesny and Fricke, 2020) for the sensitive, species-specific
    shared strains detection, in order to infer microbial transfer to the neonatal and infant microbiota,
    as well as microbial persistence during infancy, childhood and adolescence. We combined
                                                                                                                                       2

    available metagenomes from nine distinct studies, comprising over 1944 samples, which
    represents the largest meta-analysis of the neonatal and infant microbiota so far. We report robust
    associations between gut microbiota composition and age beyond the first two years of life and
    compositional alterations in C-section infants, resulting in a delayed transition from a
    predominantly oxygen-tolerant to intolerant microbiota. We show that strain sharing during the
    first year of life was most prevalent in vaginally delivered infants and almost exclusively involved
    the intestinal microbiota of the mother, whereas older infants shared strains with both of their
    parents, irrespective of birth type. Strain transfer was taxonomy-dependent and involved several
    prominent gut commensals, such as members of the genera Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and
    Parabacteroides, although other gut bacteria (e.g. Blautia, Faecalibacterium, and Ruminococcus)
    were mostly represented by new, previously undetected strains.

    MATERIAL AND METHODS
    Metagenomic sequence data
    Metagenomic shotgun sequences were collected from nine publicly available datasets, including
    samples obtained within the first week after birth (≤1W, n = 505), the neonatal period (≤1M, n =
    202), early (≤6M, n = 241) and late (≤2Y, n = 170) infancy, childhood (≤10Y, n = 74), and samples
    taken from adolescents and adults (10Y+, n = 752), 625 of which were from collected from
    respective parents of the children (Table S1). For each subject, sequence data downloaded from
    the SRA were concatenated in case of multiple available accessions. Raw paired-end
    metagenomic shotgun sequence reads were quality processed with kneaddata (KneadData
    Development Team, 2017). Sequence regions where base quality fell below Q20 within a 4-
    nucleotide sliding window were trimmed and removed if they were truncated by more than 30%
    (SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20, MINLEN:70) or aligned with the human genome (GRCh37/hg19) with
    bowtie2 (Langmead, 2010). Output files consisting of surviving paired and orphan reads were
    concatenated and used for further processing.
    Taxonomic microbiota profiling and functional annotation
    Preprocessed sequence reads from each sample were mapped against the clade-specific marker
    gene database using MetaPhlAn2 (Truong et al., 2015). Relative abundances of species-level
    taxonomic profiles were centered-log ratio (clr) transformed and used for principal components
    analysis (PCA, FactoMineR). For taxonomic analyses we further aggregated functional metadata
    on bacterial species (Table S2) from (Browne et al., 2016), (Vatanen et al., 2019), List of
    Prokaryotes according to their Aerotolerant or Obligate Anaerobic Metabolism (OXYTOL 1.3,
    Mediterranean institute of infection in Marseille), bacDive (Reimer et al., 2019), FusionDB (Zhu et
    al., 2017), The Microbe Directory v 1.0 (Shaaban et al., 2018), and the expanded Human Oral
    Microbiome Database (Escapa et al., 2018).
    Strain sharing across biological samples
    Shared strains were identified with the recently released SameStr program (Podlesny and Fricke,
    2020), leveraging within-species phylogenetic sequence variations in clade-specific marker
    genes. For this, MetaPhlAn2 marker alignments were converted to single nucleotide variant (SNV)
    profiles, filtered, merged and compared between metagenomes based on maximum variant
    profile similarity (MVS) that takes all detected single nucleotide variants (SNVs) into
    consideration, including polymorphic sites (≥10% allele frequency) resulting from multiple strains
    representing the same species. Shared strains are called for overlapping species alignments
    between metagenomic samples of ≥5kb length and with a MVS of ≥99.9%. The SameStr program
    and               further                documentation                 is           available              at             github:

    Statistical Analyses and Visualizations
    We used species and genus-level microbiota profiles to model the chronological age of the
    sample host. For this, we trained a Random Forest regression model (randomForest) on data
    from vaginally delivered infants and adults (80% data split) and evaluated the predictions (root
    mean square error (RMSE), caret) using data from the test set (20%) and C-section delivered
    infants. Variable importance was determined by quantification of mean increase of mean squared
    error (MSE) after permuting each variable. To assess the impact of delivery mode on taxonomic
    microbiota composition (Figure 2B) we calculated PERMANOVA (adonis, vegan) with 1e4
    permutations for fecal samples collected within given time ranges. Related mother/child pairs
    were identified using simple logistic regression based on the number and fraction of shared strains
    between sample pairs. We divided data into training and test data (60% / 40%) and evaluated the
    classifiers on hold-out data of vaginally and sectio-delivered infants, including calculation of the
    precision-recall (tidymodels) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (plotROC) and
    their statistics. Microbiota composition was visualized across samples (Figure 2C, 5C) with area
    plots using binomial smoothing (glm, logit-link) of relative abundances. Strain co-occurrence
    detected with SameStr (Figure 4) was visualized in networks generated with tidygraph (stress
    layout), showing sample connections with more than four shared strains.

    RESULTS
    Maturation of the taxonomic gut microbiota composition is linked to age
    In order to carry out a comprehensive characterization of the newborn microbiota, its development
    over the first weeks and months of life, and maturation during infancy and into adolescence and
    adulthood, we compiled a comprehensive dataset of over 1,700 fecal metagenomes from nine
    recent studies for meta-analysis (see Table 1 for overview). This dataset included samples from
    441 infants from 415 different families, corresponding samples from 383 mothers and 16 fathers,
    as well as cross-sectionally collected samples from eleven individuals from two families of three
    generations. A complete list of all samples and metadata is included in the supplement (Table
    S1).

    High-resolution taxonomic characterizations of all metagenomes were carried out with
    MetaPhlAn2 (Truong et al., 2015) and used to compare overall (beta-diversity) compositional
    profiles between samples at the genus and species-level. Taxonomic microbiota compositions
    could be linked to age, with adult and infant samples comprising distinct clusters in principal
    component analysis (PCA; Figure 1A, S1A). Within-sample alpha diversity served as a major
    distinguishing factor, which was strongly correlated with PC1 of the beta-diversity analysis (Figure
    1B, spearman r=0.73, p<0.001 for Shannon index). Taxonomic microbiota compositions have
    previously been associated with chronological age, based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequence data
    (Galazzo et al., 2020; Subramanian et al., 2014) or metagenomic sequence data of limited
    resolution (only three samples per infant; (Bäckhed et al., 2015)). To determine if taxonomic
    microbiota compositions in our larger dataset were linked to age and to identify those microbial
    taxa with the strongest informative value for age prediction, a random forest regression model
    was trained on 80% of compositional microbiota profiles from vaginally delivered infants or adults
    (training dataset). The accuracy of the resulting model was evaluated on hold-out samples (test
    dataset) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation between predicted and actual age,
    including for adults (Figure 1D; RMSE=0.42; Figure S1B). The relative abundances of bacterial
    genera that include typical gut (e.g. Vellonella, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium) but also skin
    (Staphylococcus, Propionibacerium) commensals were found to be most informative for the
    model (Figure 1C). Thus, the meta-analysis of our combined dataset confirms the association of
    taxonomic fecal microbiota composition with the chronological age of the human host, which
    extends beyond the first 2-3 years of life that have previously been suggested for the maturation
    into its adult composition (Arrieta et al., 2014).

    Delayed transition from predominantly oxygen-tolerant to intolerant
    microbiota in C-section infants
    As delivery mode has repeatedly been associated with compositional alterations of the neonatal
    microbiota (Bazanella et al., 2017; Shao et al., 2019; Stewart et al., 2018), we stratified our
    combined dataset for infant birth type by vaginal delivery or C-section. During the first week of
    life, birth type had a strong impact on microbiota compositions, explaining up to 4% of the
    taxonomic variation as determined by PERMANOVA (Figure 2A, p = 1e-6, adonis function, 1e4
    permutations). However, measurable associations of delivery type and microbiota composition
    decreased over time, with only 1.3% of total taxonomic variation explained by C-section in 2-year-
    old infants (p = 0.05), which was comparable to the fraction of observed variations (1.1%, n.s.)
    that was associated with gender (Figure 2B). On the genus and species level, the largest
    differences between vaginally delivered and C-section infants were observed before six months
    of age and included increased relative abundances of the bifidobacteria B. longum and B. bifidum,
    the Bacteroidales species B. dorei, B. fragilis, Parabacteroides distasonis and the
    Enterobacteriaceae species Escherichia coli in vaginally delivered infants. C-section infants were
    characterized by increased relative abundances of species from the genera Enterobacter,
    Klebsiella, Streptococcus, the family Veillonellaceae, and Enterococcus faecium (Figure 2C),
    suggesting higher colonization rates of opportunistic pathogens as previously described (Shao et
    al., 2019).
    To complement the taxonomic analysis with functional insights, available phenotype information
    was used to assign species to various functional categories, based on oxygen requirements and
    preferred habitat or growth context (Table S2). Total microbiota fractions assigned to oxygen-
    tolerant and intolerant species differed substantially between vaginally delivered and C-section
    infants (Figure 2D). In general and across all infants, microbiota fractions of oxygen-tolerant
    species continually decreased, whereas those of oxygen-intolerant species continually increased
    over the first two years of life. However, in vaginally delivered infants, oxygen-tolerant microbiota
    proportions were predominantly represented by facultative anaerobe species (mean cumulative
    relative abundance: 27.2% vs. 15.8% in sectio; e.g. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis,
    Klebsiella pneumoniae) but microaerophile species in C-section infants (mean cum. rel.
    abundance: 10.9% vs. 32.9% in sectio; e.g Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Streptococcus
                                                                                                                                     10

    vestibularis). Moreover, vaginally delivered infants started with larger proportions of strict
    anaerobe species (mean cum. rel. abundance: 48% vs. 33% in sectio; e.g. Bacteroides fragilis,
    B. vulgatus, B. dorei), which constituted >50% of the total microbiota by day 4. On average, this
    transition to a predominantly obligate anaerobe gut microbiota was delayed by 10 days in C-
    section infants. This delay is noteworthy, as microbiota maturation in general, based on the
    taxonomic alterations described above, showed no difference between vaginally born and C-
    section infants (Figure S1B). Thus, our findings are in agreement with recent reports of increased
    colonization with opportunistic pathogens in neonates born by C-section (Shao et al., 2019) and
    provide a functional extension of the suggested “stunted microbiota” phenotype as potentially
    associated with delayed microbiota transition to a predominantly oxygen-intolerant species
    composition.
    Besides oxygen intolerance, the preferred species habitat was another distinguishing feature that
    separated vaginally delivered from C-section infants (Figure 2E). Only 2.6% ± 5 of the older infant
    (>10 years) and adult gut microbiota were ascribed to non-gut or oral species (e.g. Streptococcus
    salivarius, Veillonella parvula), but these species contributed 17% ± 25.6 and 35.7% ± 32.4 to the
    neonatal microbiota of vaginally delivered and C-section infants, respectively. Species of
    predicted vaginal origin (e.g. Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, and the lactobacilli L.
    crispatus, L. iners) represented significant neonatal microbiota fractions only within the first days
    of life (2.5% ± 11.4 vs. 0.7% ± 5.4 in vaginally born and C-section infants) and species that are
    commonly associated with infections (e.g. Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter koseri) were commonly
    found in the early infant (1 day to 6 months) microbiota, in particular in infants born by C-section
    (9.2% ± 20.5% compared to 2.3% ± 9 for vaginally delivered infants).
    In summary, C-section was associated with altered gut microbiota compositions, delayed
    transition from a predominantly oxygen-tolerant to non-tolerant microbiota and increased relative
    abundance of atypical gut species, suggesting that disrupted microbiota initialization in C-section
    infants could make the neonatal ecosystem more permissive for the colonization with
    disadvantageous species and opportunistic pathogens.

    the first few years of life, the gut microbiota of vaginally delivered infants harbors larger fractions of obligate
    and facultative anaerobe species and lower fractions of microaerophile and strict aerobe species compared
    to C-section infants. E) The gut microbiota of neonates and infants (<2 years) contains larger proportions
    of species that have a preferred oral, skin or vaginal habitat or are associated with infection. This predicted
    non-gut microbiota fraction is disproportionately increased in C-section infants.
    Shared strain profiles distinguish related and unrelated mother/infant pairs
    Compositional deficits of the neonatal microbiota of infants born by C-section have been attributed
    to reduced maternal microbiota transfer (Shao et al., 2019). However, species or genus-level
    microbiota compositions provide insufficient taxonomic resolution to infer microbial transfer, as
    distinct sub-lineages within genera or even species can be shared between unrelated samples or
    individuals (Lloyd-Price et al., 2017). Therefore, in order to detect microbial transfer between
    infants and their parents and microbial persistence in infants over time, we used the recently
    developed SameStr program from our group (Podlesny and Fricke, 2020) to identify shared
    unique subspecies taxa, i.e. strains, between metagenomes from our combined dataset. Various
    definitions of microbial strains exist, based on biological and evolutionary concepts, as well as
    phenotypic or phylogenetic detection methods (Van Rossum et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020).
    SameStr applies a conservative approach to call shared strains, using restrictive thresholds to
    detect highly similar subspecies genetic variants in distinct metagenomic samples, as indication
    for strain persistence or transfer between the corresponding microbiomes (Podlesny and Fricke,
    2020). Shared strains would be unique in the sense that the corresponding subspecies lineages
    would only be found in related metagenomes (e.g. from infant/mother pairs or longitudinally
    collected samples from the same individual) but not in unrelated metagenomes (e.g. from distinct
    infants or mothers). To test the specificity of SameStr’s shared strain calls on our combined
    dataset, adult and infant (0 - 60 years) samples were divided into related (independent samples
    from the same individual) and unrelated (samples from independent individuals) pairs and
    compared in regard to shared strain predictions (Figure 3A). Both in adults and infants, shared
    strains were commonly detected in related (18.3 ± 12.4; 6.2 ± 8.3) but not unrelated sample pairs
    (0.3 ± 0.6; 0.1 ± 0.3), whereas unrelated sample pairs showed a high overlap in species and
    genus-level taxon profiles (Figure 3A). Thus, these findings attest to the sensitivity and low false
                                                                                                                                     13

    profiles to infer microbial transfer or persistence.
    To test if shared strain profiles between vaginally delivered and C-section infants during the first
    two years of life (Figure 3B) were sufficient to predict related infant/mother pairs, all sample pairs
    were divided into a training and test dataset (60/40 split) and shared strain profiles used as input
    for a random forest classifier (Figure 3C). For the prediction of vaginally born infant/mother pairs,
    the classifier achieved high and consistent accuracy (area under the Receiver Operating
    Characteristics (auROC) = 92-95%; area under Precision/Recall (auPR) = 59-66%; true positive
    (TP) rate = 1.42%), which was markedly reduced for C-section infant/mother pairs (auROC = 55-
    85%; auPR = 9-32%; TP rate = 0.93%), in particular during the first month of life but also at later
    time points.

    Construction of family networks based on shared strain calls
    In order to further assess the extent and specificity of family-specific microbiota exchange, shared
    strain profiles were used to generate unsupervised networks showing individual samples as
    nodes and shared strain numbers as edges (Figure 4). Within these networks, samples were
    generally assigned to family-specific clusters, which in many cases included infants, separate
    siblings, mothers and fathers (Figure 4A), as well as children, parents and grandparents (Figure
    4B), from the same but not distinct families.
    Network analysis also identified several inconsistent samples (Figure 4A). These samples,
    instead of sharing strains only with members from their own family, were connected to multiple
    samples from a different family (“donald1” and “alien2”) or to members from two different families
    (“bugkiller”). The inconsistent findings never included samples from different studies, but instead
    involved apparently random infant and parent samples and time points: in case of “alien2” another
    sample was collected from the same individual two days after “alien2-11-741-0” and 11 days
    before “alien2-11-754-0”, which shared no strains with these samples but with several samples
    from related family members. As there was no obvious biological explanation for these
    inconsistencies, which could result from human error (e.g. mis-labeling of the “alien2” or “donald1”
    samples) or technical problems (e.g. cross-contamination of the “bugkiller” sample), the
    conspicuous samples were removed from further analysis.
    We observed one case in our combined dataset, which suggests that microbial strain exchange
    with non-family members could take place early-on during the neonatal microbiota development:
    Five fecal samples from three distinct neonates that were collected during the first two days of life
    shared strains with each other (Figure 4C), as well as with fecal, skin and vaginal samples from
    their mothers (Figure S2). No strain sharing was detected between samples collected at later time
    points (1 week - 6 months after birth). All three infants shared between 7 and 9 strains with each
    other, none of which belonged to typical intestinal commensals but bacterial species typically
    assigned to the oral, vaginal or skin microbiota (Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis,
    Lactobacillus crispatus and L. iners, Prevotella buccalis and L. timonensis, Prevotella bivia, and
    Propionibacterium acnes). The same species were also identified in other metagenomes from the
    combined dataset but never in other unrelated sample pairs. The infants were born at the same
    neonatal ward and possibly sampled at overlapping time points (Ferretti, personal
    communication). Thus, overlapping microbiota strain profiles could have resulted from microbiota
    exchange during the stay of infants and mothers in the clinic, e.g. through family members, nurses
    and other personnel, although cross-contamination during sample collection, storage and
    processing can also not be ruled out. In any case, these findings demonstrate the utility of
    subspecies taxonomic microbiota profiling to check public or new metagenomic sequence data
    for inconsistencies and improve our understanding of developmental microbiota processes
    involving microbial transfer and exchange.

    Maternal strain transfer in neonates and persistence through infancy and
    adolescence
    To assess the role of microbiota transfer from family members to the developing infant gut
    microbiota, we first compared shared strain profiles in infants with different microbiome niches
    from the mother (Figure 5A), considering only cases from our combined dataset for which
    metagenomic sequence data from multiple maternal body sites were available (Ferretti et al.,
    2018; Heintz-Buschart et al., 2016). The largest fraction of the vaginally born infant microbiota
    was represented by shared strains with the intestinal microbiota of the mother, both immediately
    after birth (day 0-7: 30.6% ± 38.3 of the infant microbiota) and during the following weeks and
    months (day 30-120: 29.2% ± 26.5). Shared strain contributions from other maternal body sites
    were small (1.12% ± 7.76 relative abundance or 0.16 ± 0.62 strains, across all time points and
    non-intestinal maternal sites combined), mostly found during the first week of life (day 0-7: 2.56%
    ± 11.4 or 6.1 ± 5.2 strains for non-intestinal sites), and, during that time, involved shared strains
    from the vaginal (5.13% ± 18.5), skin (3.42% ± 8.24) and oral (0.03% ± 0.15) microbiota of the
    mother. Thus, ‘vaginal seeding’ of the neonatal microbiota at birth (Mueller et al., 2020) might be
    less important for the long-term microbiota development of the child than transfer of the intestinal
    microbiota of the mother.
    To also investigate the role of microbial strain transfer from fathers to infants, we used a subset
    of our combined dataset for which intestinal metagenomic sequence data was available from both
    parents (Table S1). We determined the maternal and paternal contributions to the child microbiota
    by quantifying their shared strains and the cumulative relative abundances of their respective
    species. During the first two years of life, only maternally shared strains contributed substantial
    fractions to the infant microbiota (Figure 5B; 24.89% ± 30.87 relative abundance or 1.81 ± 1.63
    strains vs. 0.52% ± 2.32 relative abundance or 0.29 ± 0.72 strains for fathers). These maternal
    microbiota contributions remained relatively stable during later infancy, adolescence, and even
    adulthood (9.5% ± 6.94 relative abundance or 4.59 ± 3.99 strains at >20 years of age), suggesting
    early transfer of intestinal microbes from the mother to the child, as well as continuous strain
    persistence, retransfer or mutual exchange between children and their mothers during infancy,
    adolescence and adulthood. Interestingly, strains that were shared with the intestinal microbiota
    of the father constituted larger fractions (7.25% ± 8.4 relative abundance or 3.97 ± 3.61 strains)
    of the older infant, adolescent and adult microbiota (Figure 5B), indicating that microbiota transfer
    and/or exchange between children and both of their parents continues long after birth and early
    infancy. Differentiation of infants based on birth type suggests that, during the first year of life, C-
    section infants harbor reduced numbers of shared strains with their mothers compared to
    vaginally born infants, but that they compensate for this reduction by sharing more strains with
    their mothers and fathers later in life (Figure S3B), although the small number of independent
    samples did not allow for statistical comparisons. The comparison of vaginally delivered and C-
    section infants with respect to shared strains with the intestinal microbiota from the mother alone
    (Figure 5C) was statistically better supported (985 infant/mother pairs): Vaginally born infants
    harbored larger maternally shared microbiota fractions immediately after birth, which remained
    relatively stable during infancy (day 0-7: 36.56% ± 36.9; ≤2 years: 33.17% ± 25.37; year 2-10:
    14.24% ± 9.1). In infants born by C-section, shared strain microbiota contributions were reduced
                                                                                                                                     17

    after birth, but increased during infancy and reached levels that were comparable to those from
    vaginally born infants in childhood (day 0-7: 8.49% ± 21.76; year 2-10: 17.1% ± 17.7). C-section
    therefore appears to delay rather than abolish maternal strain transfer to the child, at least with
    respect to the relative abundance fractions of shared strains in children.
    Finally, to better understand the dynamics of postpartum microbiota developments in the neonate,
    we assessed the fate of maternally shared species and strains during the first year of life (Figure
    5D). We first identified maternally shared strains in the first available infant sample (collected 0-7
    days after birth) and then tracked strain persistence, replacement or coexistence with other strains
    in available follow-up samples from the same infant. About 75% of the species that were identified
    immediately after birth were undetectable as early as seven days after birth, representing 50% of
    the total microbiota at that time (Figure 5D). Thus, the majority of species that colonize the infant
    gut are not acquired during birth but later in life. However, >10% of the initially identified species
    in vaginally delivered infants could still be detected one year after birth, accounting for >20% of
    the total microbiota, compared to only <5% of species and relative abundance in C-section infants.
    In summary, C-section appears to most profoundly affect the infant microbiota during the first year
    of life, resulting in reduced numbers and contributions of shared strains to the infant microbiota,
    as well as the absence of those maternal species and strains during this developmental period
    that are transferred at birth.

    Taxonomy-dependent differences in maternal strain sharing
    In order to determine if maternal strain transfer rates varied between microbial taxa, all strain and
    species observations in neonatal and infant samples were classified as representing maternal
    strains (shared species and strain), maternal species (shared species, but unknown strain), new
    strains (shared species, but new strain) and new species. The frequencies of events from all four
    categories were compared for different bacterial genera and between vaginally delivered and C-
    section infants over time (Figure 6, S4). In vaginally delivered infants, bacterial taxa could roughly
    be assigned to three distinct groups based on their strain sharing frequency: (i) Species from the
    genera Alistipes, Bacteroides, Bilophila, Parabacteroides and Sutterella were more frequently
    represented by maternal than new, previously undetected, strains (29.66% ± 24.2 maternal
    strains vs. 10.87% ± 11.15 new strains, on average); (ii) species from the genera Akkermansia,
    Bifidobacterium, Collinsella and Escherichia were relatively evenly represented by maternal and
    new strains (20.1% ± 17.85 maternal strains vs. 26.08% ± 22.08 new strains); and (iii) species
    from the genera Blautia, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus and Streptococcus were
    more frequently represented by new than maternal strains (1.76% ± 3.1 maternal strains vs.
    23.88% ± 21.33 new strains). We found at least a partial taxonomic overlap between bacterial
    strains that were most frequently shared between infants and their mothers and those that were
    most often shared between adolescents (10 years and older) and their mothers, which most
    frequently belonged to the genera Bacteroides, Eubacterium, Paracteroides and Sutterella,
    suggesting similar taxon-specific patterns of maternal strain sharing in newborns and adult
    children.
    In general, sharing of maternal strains and species was observed for the same bacterial taxa in
    vaginally delivered and C-section infants, but less frequently in C-section infants (Figure 6, S4).
    Vaginally delivered infants also exhibited less variation in the frequency of maternally shared or
    new strains over time, which could be partially explained by later maternal microbiota sharing in
    C-section infants (Figure 5). The genus Bacteroides is noteworthy, as it is frequently and
    consistently represented by maternally shared strains in vaginally delivered infants. Although
    Bacteroides strains are more frequently shared with mothers in C-section infants at >6 months of
    age, a reduced frequency of shared strains from this genus appears to persist in C-section infants,
    indicating that potential deficits in microbiota establishment and long-term development should
    be further investigated at the level of individual bacterial taxa.

    DISCUSSION
    The risk for inflammatory and metabolic diseases can be affected by inter-individual taxonomic
    and functional microbiota variations that result from events at birth and during early infancy, with
    potential life-long consequences for immune and energy homeostasis (Dominguez-Bello et al.,
    2019; Torow and Hornef, 2017). Our high-resolution taxonomic meta-analysis of available
    metagenomics shotgun sequence data presents a detailed and comprehensive picture of the
    highly dynamic neonatal and infant gut microbiota development. We showed that the developing
    microbiota continuously and consistently changed over time, as demonstrated before (Stewart et
    al., 2018; Subramanian et al., 2014), allowing for the development of microbiota-dependent age
    prediction models. In contrast to previous reports (Bäckhed et al., 2015), C-section was not
    associated with delayed microbiota maturation. Rather microbiota changes in vaginally born and
    C-section infants progressed on separate but converging paths, as the variance in taxonomic
    microbiota compositions between infants that could be explained by birth type decreased over
    time. Physiologically, these compositional differences resulted in a delayed transition from a
    predominantly oxygen-tolerant to intolerant microbiota in C-section compared to vaginally born
    infants. In human adults, differences in luminal intestinal oxygen contents have been associated
    with dysbiotic microbiota states as a consequence of antibiotic, infectious and inflammatory
    perturbations (Litvak et al., 2018). In neonatal mouse models of late onset sepsis, decreasing
    intestinal oxygen levels were linked to the transition from a dysbiotic, facultative anaerobe-
    dominated to a strict anaerobe-dominated, protective microbiota (Singer et al., 2019). However,
    in the adult intestine low luminal oxygen is controlled by a positive feedback loop between
    commensal obligate anaerobes and epithelial cells (Byndloss and Bäumler, 2018). But these
    pathways appear not to be operational in neonates, as obligate anaerobes could not be engrafted
    in neonatal mice following fecal microbiota transplantation experiments (Singer et al., 2019). The
    succession of strict anaerobic bacteria in the neonatal gut has been suggested to result from the
    consumption of intestinal oxygen by aerobic and facultative anaerobic early colonizers (Favier et
    al., 2002), which would be consistent with the increased abundance of oxygen-tolerant bacteria
    that was observed at the intestinal mucosa in mice (Albenberg et al., 2014). As opposed to
    microbe-mediated mechanisms, a reduction of luminal oxygen has also been attributed to host-
    dependent control over the neonatal microbiota transition from early colonizing facultative
    anaerobes to the obligate anaerobes that dominate the infant microbiota and are maintained
    through adult life (Robertson et al., 2019). Thus, although the specific interplay of microbe and
    host-mediated intestinal oxygen control remains unclear, the delayed transition from a facultative
    to strict anaerobe-dominated microbiota in C-section compared to vaginally delivered infants
    could play a role for risks associated with C-section (Sandall et al., 2018) and should be further
    studied.
    Taxonomic microbiota profiling at subspecies levels provides the opportunity to detect unique
    shared lineages or strains as evidence for microbial transfer. In this case, the shared strains from
    a related sample pair (e.g. from corresponding mother-infant dyads) need to be phylogenetically
    more similar than those from any unrelated sample pair (e.g. from mothers or infants without
    microbiota contact). To identify individual microbial strains, detect overlapping microbiota strain
    profiles and map microbial exchange based on unique shared strains, the recently introduced
                                                                                                                                     23

    SameStr program from our group was used (Podlesny and Fricke, 2020). As an adaptation of the
    StrainPhlAn tool (Truong et al., 2017), it uses the clade-specific marker gene database from
    MetaPhlAn2 (Segata et al., 2012) to detect species-specific strains while also allowing for shared
    strain calls between non-dominant members of multi-strain species populations - a feature which
    is not available through StrainPhlAn and increases the rate of detected shared strain events
    between related but not unrelated samples (Podlesny and Fricke, 2020). The importance of
    distinguishing individual strains among multi-strain species populations for the characterization of
    the neonatal microbiota has recently been demonstrated by Yassour et al., as colonization of
    neonates with dominant and secondary maternal strains from Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides
    species was shown to depend on selective advantages based on strain-specific carbohydrate-
    degrading capabilities (Yassour et al., 2018). Application of SameStr to our combined
    metagenome dataset resulted in >75000 (3.3% of compared species alignments) detected shared
    strain events, providing unprecedented statistical support and resolution to characterize microbial
    exchange between infants and their family members over extended periods of time from
    immediately after birth to infancy and childhood and into adolescence and adulthood. The
    specificity and sensitivity of SameStr was showcased with the visualization of shared strain
    profiles that connected members of the same but not distinct families into family-specific networks.
    For the first time, these networks also revealed the degree of microbial strain sharing that not only
    connects mothers and neonates, but also adult children and their mothers, as well as other family
    members, including infants and their siblings, fathers and grandparents. Together our findings
    reveal a complex, and so far largely unexplored network of microbiota exchange among family
    members, illustrating the previously reported dominance of environmental over host genetic
    influences on human gut microbiota composition and development (Rothschild et al., 2018).
    Early infant microbiota studies proposed colonization with the vaginal microbiota of the mother
    during birth as one of the first and most important events for microbiota initialization (Dominguez-
    Bello et al., 2010). In the absence of vaginal microbiota exposure, this creates the unfortunate
    opportunity for other, foreign and potentially disadvantageous microbes to seize upon this
    ecological niche. These other bacteria have been identified as members of the skin (Dominguez-
    Bello et al., 2010) or hospital environment microbiota (Shin et al., 2015), including many
    opportunistic pathogens (Shao et al., 2019). We detected in our meta-analysis only small and
    transient neonatal gut microbiota fractions that could be attributed to the vaginal microbiota of the
    mother, either based on functional species classification or the detection of shared species and
    strains with vaginal metagenomes. The absence of specific gut bacteria that were present in
    vaginally delivered infants, such as Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium spp., correlated with
    increased relative abundance of predicted oral and skin commensals, such as streptococci and
    staphylococci, in infants born by C-section. Shared strains between infants and their mothers,
    indicative of maternal transfer, contributed substantial, stable and long-lasting microbiota fractions
    to the newborn, infant, adolescent and adult microbiota. The intestinal rather than vaginal, skin or
    oral microbiota of the mother was the most important source of transferred microbes, at least at
    >2 weeks of age, confirming recent related reports (Ferretti et al., 2018), and this transfer was
    drastically reduced in infants born by C-section. Reconstitution of the neonatal microbiota by fecal
    microbiota transplantation (FMT) would therefore appear to be the more obvious therapeutic
    approach to compensate for the lack of maternal microbiota transfer in C-section infants, as
                                                                                                                                     24

    opposed to ‘vaginal seeding’ (Dominguez-Bello et al., 2016). In fact, a recent clinical trial on the
    use of maternal FMT in infants born by C-section found no adverse effects but increased relative
    abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae compared to untreated infants (Korpela et
    al., 2020).
    The newborn gut microbiota of vaginally delivered infants from our combined dataset included
    greater contributions of maternally transferred strains than the microbiota of C-section infants.
    These maternally transferred strains largely persisted through childhood and belonged to the
    same taxa (Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Sutterella) as bacterial strains that were most often
    shared between adolescent children and their parents, suggesting potential life-long colonization
    with maternally transferred strains from these species. However, we also commonly observed
    strain sharing in older children, in particular at >2 years of age, irrespective of birth type, and
    including mothers and fathers. Thus, additional mechanisms besides vaginal birth appear to be
    at play for familial microbiota exchange, which could compensate for the lack of maternal transfer
    in C-section infants. Detailed phylogenetic analyses of maternally transferred species could be
    applied to characterize their prevalence, distribution and relationship in different human
    populations. Similar analyses have been carried out for other members of the human microbiota
    and could help determine whether the vertical transmission of the species follows a maternal
    heritability pattern, which could be disrupted in infants born by C-section or replaced with paternal
    inheritance. Sonnenburg et al. found members of the order Bacteroidales to be disproportionately
    affected by low-fiber diet-induced microbiota depletion in mice (Sonnenburg et al., 2016) and
    Vatenen et al. presented evidence for immunoinhibitory properties of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
    cell wall components from Bacteroides species, which were associated with the development of
    type 1 diabetes (Vatanen et al., 2016). Together, these findings provide a strong justification for
    additional work on the strain-level characterization of human microbiota initialization and
    development, including developmental and clinical consequences.

    CONCLUSIONS
    Our meta-analysis presents a detailed and comprehensive picture of the highly dynamic neonatal
    and infant gut microbiota development and presents evidence for taxonomic and functional
    compositional differences early in life between infants born naturally or by C-section, which persist
    into adolescence. Our findings encourage further studies to determine whether the disrupted
    vertical microbiota transfer and lack of maternal strains and species in C-section infants leads to
    transient developmental microbiota changes or lifelong structural microbiota deficits due to new,
    altered or missing microbiota members and associated metabolic or immune functions.

    Fig. S1. Extends Fig. 1: Maturation of the taxonomic human gut microbiota composition
    is linked to age.
    A) Principal component analysis (PCA) biplot of centered log-ratio (clr)-transformed species-level microbial
    community compositions of human fecal samples obtained from neonatal stage up to late adulthood (range:
    0 - 72 years) shows a strong compositional clustering along principal components PC1 and PC2. B)
    Compositional changes during microbiota maturation are predictive of host age, which is unaffected by the
    infant delivery mode and does not suggest a general delay in microbiota maturation for infants born by C-
    section.

    multi-generational family members and distinct neonates.
    Network plot showing strain sharing between different samples collected from three newborns that were
    born at the same neonatal hospital ward and their mothers, numbered according to the sampled day after
    birth. Five fecal and one oral neonatal samples that were collected during the first two days of life shared
    strains with each other, as well as with at least one fecal, skin and vaginal samples from each of their
    mothers. No strain sharing was detected between fecal samples collected at later time points (1 week - 6
    months after birth). All three infants shared between 7 and 9 strains with each other. Dashed lines show
    connections with 2-4 shared strains.

    Fig. S3. Extends Fig. 5: Maternal strain transfer in neonates and persistence through
    infancy and adolescence.
    A) Total counts of shared strains between the infant gut microbiota and metagenomes from different body
    sites of the mother mostly show strain sharing with the maternal fecal microbiota. B) Numbers of shared
    strains with the fecal microbiota of the mother and father are increased in older children and adolescents,
    based on the analysis of available samples from infant-mother-father triads. C) Shared strain numbers
    between neonates and the fecal microbiota of the mother are higher in vaginally born compared to C-
    section infants throughout the first two years of life.

    Fig. S4. Extends Fig. 6: Taxonomy-dependent differences in maternal strain sharing.
    Bacterial genus-specific frequencies of strain and species sharing within the first two years of life are shown
    for infants born by vaginal birth and C-section. For each group, bars show the fraction (left) and the total
    number (right) of species observations, which were assigned to four categories: “Mother strain” (same
    species and strain as detected in the mother), “Mother Sp.” (same species as detected in the mother, but
    strain not resolved), “New strain” (same species as detected in the mother, but different strain), or “New
    Sp.” (species not detected in the mother). Data are shown as mean frequencies across species of selected
    genera.
