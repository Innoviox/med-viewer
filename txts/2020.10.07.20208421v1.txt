Abstract
Due to the rapid increase of COVID-19 infection cases in many countries such as the Philippines, many efforts in forecasting
the daily infections have been made in order to better manage the pandemic, and respond effectively. In this study, we consider
the cumulative COVID-19 infection cases in the Philippines from March 6 to July 31,2020 and forecast the cases from August
1 - 15, 2020 using various mathematical models —weighted moving average, exponential smoothing, Susceptible-Exposed-
Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model,
and random forest. We then compare the results to the actual data using traditional error metrics. Our results show that the
ARIMA(1,2,1) model has the closest forecast values to the actual data. Policymakers can use our result in determining which
forecast method to use for their community in order to have a data-based information for the preparation of their personnel and
facilities.

1. Introduction
     On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed about an outbreak of pneumonia of an
unknown cause in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China [40]. Barely two weeks past, the first case of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) outside China was reported in a Chinese tourist in Thailand with no epidemiological linkage to the Huanan
Seafood Wholesale Market [24]. Since then, COVID-19 quickly escalated worldwide infecting more than 200 countries and
millions of people [41]. The COVID-19 which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is
a kind of viral penumonia [28]. The most common symptoms at the onset of the disease include fever, cough, fatigue, dyspnea,
myalgia, normal or decreased leukocyte counts, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia [28, 35]. Several evidences suggest
that it can be transferred from person-to-person through direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing
from an infected individual [35].
     Rapid increase in daily infection rates, severity of the cases, and death toll proved that the disease is highly contagious and
infectious. In the absence of a vaccine, prevention and control are vital to suppress the spread of the virus in a way that the
healthcare system can contain the surge of patients, and the economy can recuperate the impacts of lockdown restrictions. To
this aim, modeling and forecasting are very important to lay down effective and data-based decisions, strategies, and policies.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there have been many publications using various mathematical and machine learning-based
models that forecast the spread and give a prediction of the epidemic peak globally, for specific countries such as in Brazil
[34], Russia, India, and Bangladesh [32], and USA [2].
     The dynamics of the COVID-19 infection vary per country and depend on many factors such as the government’s response,
the capacity of the healthcare system, testing and contact tracing efforts, quarantine and lockdown impositions, and reaction
of the general public to the pandemic. In the Philippines, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on January 30, 2020 while
the first local transmission was confirmed on March 7, 2020 [39]. On March 17, 2020, the Philippine government declared
an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in the entire island of Luzon and other parts of the county for a month and later
extended until April 30 to curb the transmission of the disease [21]. Months since the lockdown, the economy gradually
reopened with less stringent quarantine regulations in each province or region. However, the daily infection cases have not
been significantly reduced yet. As of September 7, 2020, the total cases in the Philippines escalated to 238,727 [23]. Therefore,
continuous effort to model and forecast the spread of the disease in the country is very helpful in the fight against COVID-19.
     The UP-OCTA team has been actively forecasting the spread of the disease in different places in the Philippines. From April
30 to July 23, they were able to produce nine forecasts of COVID-19 cases using Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered

(SEIR) models and Moving Average models [9, 8, 12, 13, 11, 7, 10, 15, 14]. The heterogeneous characteristics of different
age populations were incorporated in studying the effects of the ECQ in reducing the exponential growth of the disease as
well as the forecasts of transmission rate [17]. An SEIR model considering the symptomatic and asymptomatic populations
was developed in [1] to describe the dynamics of the disease. The group used the data on the confirmed cases and death from
several countries including France, Philippines, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, China, and the USA to calibrate the model.
    This study forecasts the cumulative daily cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines using various mathematical models. We
examine six models and determine which best suits the considered Philippine data. The models under comparison are moving
averages, exponential smoothing, SEIR, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA),
and random forest. The data set is fit using each of the models and subsequently, obtain forecasts for August 1-15. These
forecasts are then compared to the actual values using various error metrics. The paper is organized as follows.
    In Section 2, a description of the utilized data set is provided. Sections 3 to 8 discuss the implementation of the models and
the derivation of the forecast values. The discussion on the comparison of the results from the six models is done in Sections
9 and 10.
2. Data Framework
    Since April 12, COVID-19 data in the country have been made available through the COVID-19 tracker in order to promote
transparency and accountability of data in the country. The tracker provides a daily COVID-19 data drop which contains
multiple COVID-19 infection-related data based on multiple cases such as specimen collection, release of result, date of the
start of symptom for each patient, date of reporting/ confirmation of positive COVID-19 result, etc. We only consider the
infections based on the date of reporting/ confirmation of positive COVID-19 result, as this is the commonly reported data to
the public. Shown in Table 1 are the descriptive statistics of the data to be considered and Figure 1 illustrates the actual March
6 to July 31 data.

3. Simple and Weighted Moving Averages
3.1. Preliminaries
    In this section, we consider two types of moving average (MA) –the simple moving average (SMA) and the weighted
moving average (WMA). We apply them to the cumulative cases to give forecasts for August 1 - 15. There are many different
intervals used in literature regarding COVID-19 such as 3−day, 5−day, 7−day, 10−day, and 14−day [19, 22, 38]. In most
cases, the 7−day MA is considered to cover both the incubation period and the time it takes from the first symptoms to occur
to diagnosis [22].
    The standard formula to get the forecast for the nth day for an m-day SMA, is given by
                                                                  Cn−1 + Cn−2 + · · · + Cn−m
                                                       SMAn =
                                                                               m
where Ci is the number of total confirmed cases at time i.
    Simple moving average gives equal weights for all the data in a specific interval. While this is good for data sets whose
entries are not dependent on the previous entries, it is far from good for those whose entries are highly dependent on the
previous entries. Due to the increasing trend in the data set, it is better to consider higher weights in more recent entries. For
this purpose, we also consider weighted moving average.
                                                                                                                       2i
    One of the most common weight functions used in weighted moving average is w(i) =                                          for the ith day in the
                                                                                                                  m(m + 1)
m-day interval. The standard formula to get the forecast for the nth day for an m-day WMA is given by
                                                                     Xm
                                                          WMAn =         w(m + 1 − i)Cn−i
                                                                     i=1
where Ci is the number of total confirmed cases at time i. Note that the sum of the weights in a weighted moving average must
be equal to 1.
3.2. Numerical Implementation
    We consider 3−day, 4−day, 7−day, and 10−day MA to have a comparison among different intervals for both types of
moving average.
3.2.1. Simple Moving Average
    We apply SMA to the cumulative cases but the result was undesirable. For example, the actual cumulative cases on July
31 is 93351 while the forecast total number of COVID-19 cases on August 1 using 4-day SMA is 87881, which is inconsistent
since the total cumulative cases must be increasing. In fact, the forecast for August 15 is 89556, which is still lower than the
total cases on July 31. Instead of applying SMA directly to the cumulative cases, we applied SMA to the daily cases. To get
the forecast for the cumulative cases for August 1, we add the forecast for the daily cases on August 1 to the actual total cases
as of July 31 .
    Below is the table showing the forecasts using SMA on the different intervals mentioned.

4. Exponential Smoothing
4.1. Preliminaries
    Exponential smoothing models are commonly used in time series forecasting. These models are simple since the forecasts
are generated by obtaining weighted averages of the past observations where the weights exponentially decrease as the ob-
servations get older. Exponential smoothing models produce reliably accurate forecasts since they can also capture the trend,
seasonality, or a combination of both [25].
    It can be observed from Figure 1 that the data has an increasing trend but has no seasonality. Hence, we choose Holt’s
linear trend method to obtain 15-day ahead forecasts of the total number of confirmed cases in the Philippines for it allows
forecasting with trend.
    The Holt’s linear trend method (HLTM) extends the simple exponential smoothing method by using two smoothing equa-
tions both of which are dependent on the estimated level and estimated trend of the series at a particular time. The h-step ahead
forecasting formula under this method is given by the following:
                                            Forecast Equation:           ŷt+h|t = lt + hbt
                                                                 with    lt = αyt + (1 − α)(lt−1 + bt−1 )
                                                                  and    bt = β(lt + lt−1 ) + (1 − β)bt−1
where, at time t, yt and ŷt+h represent the actual and the forecast values, respectively, lt represents the estimated level of the
data, and bt represents the estimated trend of the data. Furthermore, α and β are the smoothing factors of the level and the
trend, respectively, with 0 ≤ α, β ≤ 1.
    The confidence interval of the forecasts is given by
                                                          ŷt+h|t − 1.96σh , ŷt+h|t + 1.96σh
                                                                                              
where                                                      h                                           i
                                              σ2h = σ2 1 + (h − 1){α2 + αβh + 61 β2 h(2h − 1)}
with σ as the variance of the forecast errors [25].
4.2. Numerical Implementation
    We set the initial values of the parameters to be α = 0.5 and β = 0.5 with l1 = y1 and b1 = y2 − y1 . We then calculate
the 1-day forecasts and the the sum of squared errors (SSE). With this, we obtain the values of α and β that minimize the SSE
subject to the restrictions of α and β. The values of the parameters that minimize the SSE are α = 1 and β = 0.5742. These
parameters are used to calculate the 15-day ahead forecasts, as well as the forecast confidence interval of the cumulative daily
COVID-19 cases in the Philippines. The summary is shown in Table 5.

                                       Figure 4: Exponential smoothing using HLTM forecasts vs the actual data
    As expected from the Holt’s linear trend method, we can see in Figure 4 that the 15-day ahead forecasts exhibit an increas-
ing trend. Moreover, majority of the actual values lie within the prediction interval, suggesting that the method produced fairly
reliable forecast values.
5. SEIR
5.1. Preliminaries
Model
Differential equation-based models like the SEIR model give information which is useful in controlling different infectious
diseases. These models describe disease’s dynamics in macroscopic level [33]. In this study, we also include the Susceptible-
Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model to describe the dynamics of COVID-19 in the Philippines, taking into account the
mortality due to COVID-19 infection. In this model, S is the number of susceptible individuals, E is the number of exposed
individuals, I is the number of infected individuals, and R is the number of recovered individuals. Susceptible individuals may
be in contact with infected individuals and are transferred to the exposed population at rate β. A portion σ of the exposed
individuals will become infected. Infected individuals die at rate d or recover from the disease at rate γ.

Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis is a method used to identify the effect of each parameter in the model output, which in this case, is the
infected population (I). In this study, a global sensitivity analysis technique called partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC)
analysis is used. To implement PRCC, a stratified random sampling without replacement is used to obtain input parameter
values. This method is called Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) which is introduced in [30].
    In Figure 6, each bar corresponds to a PRCC value at an instance, specifically in days t = 67 + 10k, k = 0, 1, ..., 13. A large
absolute PRCC value implies a large correlation of the parameter with the output.The value 1 means a perfect positive linear
relationship while −1 means a perfect negative linear relationship. The parameters with high PRCC values (> 0.5 or < −0.5)
are R0 , σ, γ, and τ. Moreover, R0 and σ have positive PRCC values implying that an increase in the values of these parameters
will increase I. In contrast, γ and τ have negative PRCC values which means that a positive change in these parameters will
decrease I.

Parameter Estimation
The output using the SEIR model is made close to the gathered data by estimating some of the parameters for which the model
output is sensitive. Reported COVID-19 cases and recoveries in the Philippines are available on the COVID-19 tracker. We
use these data sets to estimate the reproduction number (R0 ), progression rate from the exposed population to the infected
population (σ), and the recovery rate (γ). The model output was found to have high sensitivity values on these parameters
which indicate the parameters’ influential effect to the outcome.We estimate these parameters by minimizing the error between
the gathered data and the model output. The estimates are R0 = 1.5811, σ = 0.013, and γ = 0.0069. Figure 7 shows the
reported data and the corresponding best fit.

5.2. Numerical Implementation
    Using the values obtained in the parameter estimation and the values gathered from other studies on the disease, we forecast
the cumulative cases from August 1 - 15 in the country. Table 7 shows the 15-day forecast using the SEIR model and Figure 8
displays the forecast vs actual data.

    Although a similar trend can be perceived in the estimates and the actual data, observe that the SEIR model gave low
estimates and the error increases as time passes.This may be attributed to the sudden rise of cases in the month of August as
COVID-19 testing in the country improves.

from equation   (7), the white noise generated by the actual value from the forecast relatively increases. The noise attributed is

7. ARIMA
    Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models are widely used in time series modeling and forecasting.
This class of models was developed by Box and Jenkins [3] and is intended to describe the process based on historical data.
One characteristic of ARIMA models that separate it from other forecasting models is the incorporation of autocorrelation
of the data set. This information describes the correlation between observations at different time lags. The general form is
given by ARIMA (p, d, q), where p, d, and q refer to the number of autoregressive (AR) parameters, the order of differencing,
and the number of moving average (MA) parameters, respectively. The AR component accounts for the pattern between time
lags. The MA term measures the adaptation of new forecasts to prior forecast errors. The differencing is performed to remove
the trend present in the data set and reduce the non-stationarity [37]. In this section, we forecast the cumulative number of
COVID-19 infection cases in the Philippines for August 1-15 using an ARIMA model.
7.1. Preliminaries
    Due to the increasing trend in the data set as observed in Figure 1, this results in the nonstationarity of the data set. To
remove the trend, we perform first-order differencing. Using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity, it was
found out that the differenced data set is nonstationary at α = 0.05. We apply another first-order differencing (equivalently a
second-order differencing to the original data set) and resulted in a stationary process using ADF at α = 0.05. The resulting
stationary process is illustrated in Figure 10.
                                                                               11

7.2. Numerical Implementation
    We execute a correlogram analysis on the second-order differenced data set and the autocorrelation (ACF) and partial
autocorrelation (PACF) plots are presented in Figure 11. Significant spikes at lag one in the ACF and PACF suggest that an
autoregressive (AR) process and a moving average (MA) process at that lag may help explain the data. We examine several
models for different values of p (order of AR) and q (order of MA), with p and q capped at 5. We compare these models
based on the Akaike information criterion (AICc) and the Schwarz’s criterion (SBC). Based on the AICc, the best fit model is
ARIMA (5,2,4), while ARIMA (1,2,1) is found to the best fit using SBC. The comparison of the models based on AICc and
SBC are shown in Table 10. In Figure 12, ARIMA (1,2,1) and ARIMA (5,2,4) are plotted against the original time series.

8. Random Forest
8.1. Preliminaries
     Random forest (RF) is a machine learning method for classification and regression problems based from Classification and
Regression Tree (CART) and Bagging [31, 18]. Basically, it is a forest made up of a number of decision trees that grow in
randomly selected subspaces of the feature space [18, 4]. The idea is to generate a combination of decision trees which will
be bootstrapped from the learning sample and from a subset of random features from each chosen node. Every decision tree
generated will be built on a subset of learning points and features that were considered from each chosen node to split on.
Each tree will be grown to the largest extent possible, and there will be no pruning. After these trees have been fitted through
bootstrapping, new forecast will be generated from averaging the forecasts of the trees [18]. An illustration of the process of
forecasting in RF is shown below.
                                      Figure 13: Forecasting process using random forest given n number of trees
     Aside from model fitting, RF has been extensively used in various machine learning forecasting studies such as electricity
load, employee turnovers, and even on epidemics forecasting [18, 31, 20, 36]. Recently, it has also been used to analyze,
predict, and evaluate COVID-19 in India, and COVID-19 patient health [27, 26]. Based from [27] on COVID-19 predictions
in India, results from the random forest machine learning algorithm outperformed other machine learning methods. Thus, we
implement RF to forecast the COVID-19 cumulative cases of infection in the Philippines.
     Using the randomForest package in R [29], we first set the training data and testing data to 148 (number of days from
March 6 to July 31) and 15 (number of days to be forecasted), respectively. After which, we fit RF on the training data set with
the following parameter inputs:
    1. Training data: COVID-19 cumulative cases of infection in PH from March 6 to July 31, 2020
    2. Types of random forest: regression
    3. Number of trees: 1000
    4. Number of candidate split variables at each split: 1
After this, we set up a data frame to hold the RF model predictions since we are forecasting cases that haven’t been observed
yet. We set up a 97.5% confidence interval for our predictions, and compute for the forecasts (point) with an upper and lower
bound, and its standard deviation.
8.2. Numerical Implementation
     We simulate 15-day ahead forecasts for the RF method. Shown in Table 14 are the results.

    From Figure 14, notice that RF produced underestimates compared to the actual values for the August 1 - 15 COVID-19
infection cases in the Philippines. Some of the initial values were almost captured on the interval, but the further increase of
actual COVID-19 cases data in the Philippines was not captured in our result, which showed an almost linear trend based from
the plot. Abundance in data is necessary for a better forecast for a machine learning algorithm, which was not evident in this
case. Increasing the number of trees did not also differ from the result generated with 1000 trees.
9. Analysis of Forecast Errors
    We plot the 15-day ahead forecasts for August 1 - 15, 2020 from the six models: 3-day WMA, exponential smoothing
using HLTM, SEIR model, OU process, ARIMA model, and RF. We then compare them to the actual cumulative cases of
infection data in the Philippines.

   Figure 15: Plot of 15-day-ahead forecast points of the cumulative COVID-19 cases in the Philippines of various mathematical models vs the actual data
     From Figure 15, notice that all models except RF were able to follow the trend of the actual data. The RF model failed to
observe an increasing trend compared to the other models, and was not able to forecast the data well. Of those models that
continued to increase, the ARIMA model, 3-day WMA, and HLTM were able to maintain a difference of less than 10,000
cases from the actual data, given the considered forecast period. As the 15th day forecast was approached, the ARIMA(1,2,1)
model is closest to the actual values.

values, and c is the mean of the actual values with K = 15. From all the error metrics, the ARIMA(1,2,1) model forecasts
have the least errors while the random forest forecasts have the highest. Therefore, among the six models used in this study,
ARIMA(1,2,1) has the best forecasts of cumulative COVID-19 cases in the Philippines from August 1-15, 2020.
10. Summary and Conclusion
     In this study, we obtained 15-day ahead forecasts for the daily cumulative COVID-19 cases in the Philippines using
mathematical models namely 3-day weighted moving average, exponential smoothing using Holt’s linear trend method, SEIR
model, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, ARIMA (1,2,1) model, and random forest. We considered the March 6 to July 31 COVID-
19 infection data (based from public confirmation date) retrieved from the DOH COVID-19 Data Drop. All models except the
random forest produced forecasts that exhibit an increasing trend, with ARIMA (1,2,1) having the closest forecast values to
the actual August 1 - 15 data based on the error analysis.
     Results from the study can be used by policymakers in determining which forecast method to use/ adapt in their community,
especially to those with case behavior similar to the Philippines. These 15-day ahead forecasts provide data-based information
for the preparation of the personnel and facilities, and delivery of an effective response. Others may also replicate the methods
used and might have a different “best model” for their community. We do note that all models used in the study were based on
the retrieved data drop only. Thus, factors that might affect the actual data values such as delay or error in reporting were not
considered and might have an effect to the result of this study. A longer amount of data considered might also produce more
accurate forecast results. Moreover, we only considered cumulative cases based from the public confirmation date and thus,
further studies may consider other data in the data drop, such as cases based on date specimen collection, release of result,

another machine learning method since the RF model did not do well on our data.
