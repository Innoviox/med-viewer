22  Abstract
23
24  Background
25  Between 2014 and 2017, successive cholera epidemics occurred in South Sudan within the
26  context of civil war, population displacement, flooding, and drought. Understanding the
27  determinants of cholera spread in complex settings like this can provide valuable insights for
28  mitigating future cholera risk.
29
30  Methods
31  We analyzed cholera linelist and molecular data to describe the spatio-temporal progression of
32  the epidemics. We explored the role of rainfall, population movement and vaccination
33  campaigns in shaping the explaining incidence and the spatial distribution of reported cases.
34
35  Findings
36  South Sudan experienced three distinct cholera epidemic waves of cholera ranging from 6-18
37  months with more than 28,000 cases reported and more than 2 million cholera vaccine doses
38  delivered to curb transmission. The 2014 and 2015 epidemics remained spatially limited while
39  the 2016/17 epidemic exploded along the Nile river. Initial cases of each epidemic were
40  reported in or around Juba soon after the start of the rainy season, but we found no evidence
41  that rainfall modulated transmission during each epidemic. All isolates analyzed had similar
42  genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, closely related to sequences from Uganda and
43  Democratic Republic of Congo. The direction of large-scale population movements between
44  counties with cholera outbreaks was consistent with the spatial distribution of outbreaks. As of
45  September 2020, zero cholera cases have been confirmed within South Sudan since 2017.

48  The three epidemic waves were caused by V. cholerae of the same clonal origin despite the
49  periods of no reported cases between waves. While the complex emergency likely shaped
50  some of the observed spatial and temporal patterns of reported cases, the full scope of
51  transmission determinants remains unclear. Timely and well targeted use of cholera vaccine
52  can avert cases and deaths, however, most of the vaccine campaigns occurred after the
53  epidemic peak highlighting the challenges of delivering vaccines quickly in response to an
54  outbreak in settings like South Sudan. These analyses provide a multi-faceted template for
55  examining cholera dynamics through epidemiological, microbiological, climatic, and behavioral
56  lenses.

60  Research in context
61
62  Evidence before this study
63  We searched PubMed for articles published between January 1st, 1970 and September 18th,
64  2020 using "cholera"[title] AND (epidemic OR outbreak) AND (Africa OR emergency OR
65  conflict) AND (molecular OR sequencing OR rain OR precipitation OR mobility OR movement
66  OR vaccine OR WASH). We also downloaded reported cases and deaths from the Global
67  Health Observatory Data repository on all outbreaks in the geographical area of South Sudan.
68  Across the globe, there are an estimated 2.9 million cases and 95,000 deaths annually. Many
69  of these cases occurred in areas with poor infrastructure including peri-urban slums, rural
70  areas dependent on surface water, and areas with complex emergencies .
71
72  Cholera has been introduced into the African continent several times over the past 50 years. In
73  particular, endemic transmission has been maintained in several countries bordering the
74  African Great Lakes, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Tanzania, and
75  Malawi. In contrast, reported cholera in South Sudan appears in cycles, with few reported
76  outbreaks prior to 2005, a period of annual epidemics reported between 2005 and 2009, and
77  then no reported cases between 2010 and 2014. The South Sudanese Civil War began in
78  December 2013, leading to damaged essential infrastructure and displaced hundreds of
79  thousands of individuals and a return of cholera, in successive annual waves starting in 2014.
80  Previous studies have demonstrated associations between epidemic cholera and complex
81  emergencies (e.g., Yemen, Haiti, Democratic Republic of the Congo), mass population
82  movement (e.g., Senegal), and precipitation (e.g., Yemen and Haiti); however it is unclear how
83  these factors interact to shape cholera epidemics. Oral cholera vaccination campaigns have
84  only recently been used both in response to epidemics and preventatively thought its impact at
85  the population level has not been well described.

 90  Added value of this study
 91  Our study helps explain the complex story of three epidemic waves of cholera in South Sudan
 92  that began soon after the beginning of the civil war. We showed how each wave began in the
 93  capital city of Juba at the start of the rainy season and spread to different areas of the country.
 94  Using molecular data, isolates from all four years were found to be from the same clonal origin.
 95  We presented evidence, including the analyses of previously published whole genome
 96  sequences, that cholera was likely introduced in 2013 or 2014 from Uganda or the Democratic
 97  Republic of Congo and may have been re-introduced through multiple cross-border
 98  transmission events. We identified large-scale population displacement and movement as
 99  partially explaining the differences in the number of cases between years and transmission
100  during the dry season of the 2016-2017 wave. Lastly, we describe 36 vaccination campaigns
101  providing over 2 million doses of cholera vaccine: we find that early vaccination may have
102  reduced local outbreak sizes though most vaccination activities occurred after the peak week of
103  cases.
104
105  Implications of all the available evidence
106  Our research highlights the need for regional-level responses to curb outbreaks of cholera in
107  humanitarian settings. In addition to oral cholera vaccine campaigns and interventions to
108  improve water, sanitation, and hygiene in these vulnerable settings, controlling cholera in
109  nearby countries that have the potential to introduce cholera might be an effective additional
110  strategy to reduce cases. Increased sampling of Vibrio cholerae from both human cases and
111  environmental samples combined with whole genome sequencing can help us better
112  understand how cholera spreads across borders and maintains itself in the environment.

                                                                                                                                     5

114  transmission could lead to improved global representativeness of sequences and integration of
115  results into local decision-making processes. While increased precipitation has been linked to
116  increased cholera transmission in many settings, we found that it was associated with the
117  onset of outbreaks, but not with increases in transmission once an outbreak has begun. While
118  our study adds to the evidence on the role of population movement in cholera outbreaks,
119  improved methods for measuring population movement within and between countries during
120  complex emergencies is needed to better characterize these relationships.

124  Introduction
125
126  The seventh cholera pandemic, first recognized in 1960, continues to plague populations with
127  poor access to safe water and sanitation across the world. Although estimates of the global
128  burden are uncertain, over 140,000 suspected cholera cases are reported annually from Sub-
129  Saharan Africa.1 Universal access to water and sanitation would likely eliminate cholera
130  transmission but is unlikely given the current pace of progress and financial commitments.2
131
132  In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) led Global Task Force on Cholera Control
133  (GTFCC) developed a roadmap to end cholera by 2030 and in 2018 a resolution to end cholera
134  was adopted at the 71st World Health Assembly.3 The roadmap calls for a geographically-
135  targeted approach to use limited resources in areas with a high-risk of cholera, requiring an in-
136  depth understanding of transmission across endemic and epidemic settings. South Sudan is
137  one of the 47 focal countries of this roadmap. Detailed analyses of historical cholera in South
138  Sudan, which has suffered from civil-war, mass population movements, floods and droughts,
139  can provide important lessons for cholera control in similar epidemic-prone settings.
140
141  Three successive epidemic waves of cholera occurred in South Sudan between 2014 and
142  2017, leading to tens of thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths, many among internally
143  displaced persons (IDPs).4–6 Each wave varied greatly by geographic extent, timing, and
144  magnitude and were separated by periods, with few to no reported cases. It is unclear whether
145  each outbreak was the result of a new introduction of Vibrio cholerae O1 or whether cholera
146  was present but undetected between outbreaks. Here, using detailed cholera case data
147  collected from 2014 through 2017, we describe the key features of the successive epidemic
148  waves and explore how precipitation, population displacement, and vaccination campaigns
149  may explain the differences between waves.

151  Methods
152
153  Cholera surveillance system
154  The Ministry of Health Republic of South Sudan (MoH) in collaboration with local health
155  authorities implemented cholera surveillance through both the Integrated Disease Surveillance
156  and Response (IDSR) and Early Warning Alert and Response Network (EWARN) with support
157  from WHO and the Health Cluster. Linelist data were collected from all sites treating cholera
158  patients across the country, including cholera treatment centers and oral rehydration points
159  from June 2014 to December 2017. Prior to the confirmation cholera, a suspected cholera case
160  was defined as any patient aged ≥5 years who developed severe dehydration or died from
161  acute watery diarrhoea. After cholera was confirmed within a county, a suspected cholera case
162  was any patient ≥2 years who developed acute watery diarrhoea.                              A confirmed case was a
163  suspected case with culture-confirmed V. cholerae O1. We use the term epidemic waves to
164  describe a rise and decline of reported cholera cases at the national-level, which is a different
165  concept than the previously described ‘waves’ of the 7th pandemic 7.
166
167  Laboratory analysis
168  When suspected cases were first reported in a county, stool specimens from select suspected
169  cases were sent to the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) for culture confirmation.8
170  Additional isolates were collected from suspected cases and tested by culture at the NPHL in
171  2015 in a vaccine effectiveness study.9 Overall, 150 isolates from South Sudan (and 10 from
172  Uganda) were sent to the French National Reference Center for Vibrios and Cholera (Institut
173  Pasteur, Paris, France) for serotype, antibiotic resistance pattern testing (disk diffusion
174  following Comité de l'Antibiogramme de la Société Française de Microbiologie 2013 standards
175  for Enterobacteriaceae) and Etests (AB bioMérieux, Solna, Sweden) for the determination of
                                                                                                                                     8

179
180  Rainfall data
181  Given that few sites directly measured rainfall in South Sudan during the study period, we used
182  remote sensing-derived estimates. We obtained average daily precipitation estimates from
183  2010-2018 at the country, state, and county level from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed
184  Precipitation with Station Data dataset (https://climateserv.servirglobal.net/).
185
186  Population displacement data
187  We used county-level population estimates from WorldPop
188  (https://data.humdata.org/organization/worldpop). To better understand population movements
189  as a result of the conflict, we acquired Mobility Tracking Data from the International Office of
190  Migration (IOM) (https://www.globaldtm.info/). During the 2nd Round of Mobility Tracking (Mar-
191  Apr 2018), IOM officers interviewed key informants (e.g. local authorities, community leaders
192  and humanitarian partners) in 46/78 counties to estimate the number of individuals (internally
193  displaced persons and returnees) present at assessment areas. These counties include 18/29
194  cholera-affected counties accounting for 62% of suspected cholera cases across the study
195  period. Key informants also provided information on the year when individuals arrived and from
196  where they came.13
197
198  Intervention data
199  WHO collated data from all oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaigns conducted between
200  2014 and 2018. We attempted to collate data on water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)
201  interventions but these data were not systematically reported.

203  Data Analysis
204  We calculated the weekly number of cases, attack rate (AR), case-fatality ratio (CFR), the
205  proportion of cases <5 years old, and proportion male. For most cases, we relied on the self-
206  reported date of symptom onset for each case; when this was not available, we used the date
207  of health facility visit. Administrative vaccination coverage was calculated by dividing the total
208  number of first round doses delivered by the estimated target population size. To explore the
209  potential effect of vaccination campaigns, we compared the attack rates of outbreaks where
210  vaccine was used before the epidemic peak with those where it was used after the peak with
211  Poisson regression models using the population size as an offset.
212
213  We generated a maximum likelihood tree from the 1210 publicly available V. cholerae O1
214  whole genomes.14–16 This tree closely resembles the phylogeny of 1203 genomes from Weill et
215  al,14 but includes 7 genomes from Uganda published separately.16 GenBank accession
216  numbers for all 1210 sequences are available in the supplement.17 For each reference-based
217  assembly (reference accession:AE003852/AE003853), we masked recombinant sites manually
218  (https://figshare.com/s/d6c1c6f02eac0c9c871e) and using Gubbins v2.3.418 as previously
219  described.15 We generated the tree from the `filtered_polymorphic_sites` FASTA outputted by
220  Gubbins, which contained only the 10,098 variant sites in our alignment. We used IQ-TREE
221  v1.6.10 19 with a GTR substitution model and 1000 bootstrap iterations.20 We rooted the tree on
222  A6 by first constructing a tree containing an outgroup sequence
223  (M66,accession:CP001233/CP001234) and choosing the most ancestral non-outgroup strain.
224  We visualized phylogenetic trees using FigTree v1.4.4
225  (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). For MLVA analysis, we defined a clonal complex as
226  a group of isolates where each differs (in loci-specific copy number) from at least one other
227  isolate in the complex at no more than one locus.

229  We used a distributed lag non-linear model21–23 to investigate how accumulated rainfall over the
230  previous seven days (AR7D) is associated with changes in cholera transmission in Juba
231  County, as characterized by the instantaneous basic reproductive number, R0(t). We first jointly
232  estimated the serial interval and reproductive number for the period of epidemic growth for
233  each wave using methods described by White and Pagano.24 R0(t) was calculated using
234  previously described methods 25,26 assuming a shifted gamma distributed serial interval with a
235  mean of 3.9 days, a standard deviation of 5.8 days based on the estimates of the 2015 wave,
236  which was largely confined to Juba County. We assumed that infection leads to complete
237  immunity over the study period and that 10% of infections were reported as medically attended
238  cholera cases27. We fit a quasipoisson model with penalized splines transforming AR7D and
239  lags up to 10 days. The results from this model provide an estimate of the relative R0(t) over 10
240  days following a day with a given value of AR7D compared to an AR7D of 0mm.

242  We aggregated population movement data to the county level. The origin of returnees
243  immigrating to South Sudan is presented at the country level. Data were most often available at
244  the annual scale (e.g. population movement for 2015/2016 was evenly split between the two
245  years). We calculated the expected number of cholera cases exported by one county to
246  another by multiplying the attack rate for each county by the number of people leaving that
247  area during the same year.

256  After three years without cases, the MoH confirmed a cholera case in Juba County (Central
257  Equatoria State) on April 28, 2014 soon after the start of the rainy season. Case reports
258  increased in Juba County and in the neighboring Eastern Equatoria State (Figures 1 and 2),
259  where CFRs reached as high as 5% (Table 1). Cholera was then reported in the northeastern
260  state of Upper Nile (1,044 cases) where most cases came from an IDP camp outside of
261  Malakal (South Sudan’s second largest city). In total, over the course of 29 weeks, 13 counties
262  reported 6,389 suspected cholera cases (AR=0.05%) and 139 cholera-related deaths
263  (CFR=2.3%, Table 1). Among suspected cases, 25% were children <5 years old and 52% were
264  male. Overall, 430 suspected cases from five different states underwent laboratory
265  confirmation; 44% were confirmed positive for V. cholerae O1 by culture (Table S1). The last
266  confirmed and suspected case reported in 2014 was on October 27 and on November 8 in
267  Eastern Equatoria State.
268
269  Second Wave – 2015
270  Following a period of 27 weeks with no suspected cases, the first confirmed case of the second
271  wave was reported in Juba County on May 20, 2015. In 2015, over the course of 21 weeks,
272  1,816 suspected cases (AR=0.02%) and 47 deaths (CFR=2.6%) were reported. Among
273  suspected cases, 18% were <5 years old and 55% were male. Nearly all suspected cases
274  (89%) came from Juba County between May 20 and Oct 15; the remaining 196 cases were
275  reported in two nearby counties (Figure 1B). Out of the 132 samples from suspected cases
276  tested in 2015, 33% were confirmed positive by culture. The last confirmed and suspected
277  cases from the 2015 wave occurred in Juba County on September 11 and October 15,
278  respectively.
279
280  Third Wave – 2016 & 2017
281  Following a period of 34 weeks with no suspected cases, South Sudan began to experience its
282  largest reported cholera outbreak in recent history, with 20,438 suspected cases (AR=0.18%)
                                                                                                                                   12

283  and 428 deaths (CFR=2.13%). Among suspected cases, 22% were under five and 48% were
284  male. On June 18, 2016, Juba County reported the first confirmed cholera case of the year
285  within the country, later than both of the previous years. In 2016, 139 of 402 (34.6%) suspected
286  cases were confirmed. Confirmed cases occurred in Central Equatoria State, Eastern
287  Equatoria State, Jonglei State, Lakes State, and Unity State (Table S1). As rainfall decreased
288  from October to December 2016, no additional counties reported cholera.
289
290  Through the dry season, counties along the Nile River continued to report suspected cases
291  (Figure 2). Beginning in January, outbreaks were observed in new areas of Lakes State, Unity
292  State, and Jonglei State. Ayod County (Jonglei State) experienced a particularly explosive
293  outbreak with 3,855 suspected cases and 39 deaths occurring between March 27 and July 9,
294  2017 (>250 cases per week) and 3,276 cases over a 3-week period; many of these cases
295  occurred in cattle camps, where nomadic pastoralists have little to no access to safe water and
296  sanitation 28. As the rainy season began in 2017, suspected cases were detected in
297  northeastern (Upper Nile State), southeastern (Eastern Equatoria State), and central (Warrap
298  State) South Sudan. In 2017, 231 of 453 (51.0%) suspected cases across seven states were
299  confirmed by culture. The last confirmed and suspected cases were reported on August 30 and
300  November 29 respectively, with no additional cases reported through the time of revising this
301  manuscript (18-Sept-2020).
302
303  Vaccination Campaigns
304  In addition to case management, surveillance, and WASH interventions, over 2 million doses of
305  OCV were administered in South Sudan between 2014 and 2018. There were 36 vaccine
306  campaigns (2014: 6, 2015: 6, 2016: 4, 2017: 17, 2018: 3) across 15 of the 34 cholera-affected
307  counties (10 campaigns occurred in Juba County). The population reached during each
308  campaign’s first round (typically out of two) ranged between 1,926 and 206,521. While the
309  administrative coverage (number of doses delivered / estimated population size) of most
                                                                                                                                   13

310  campaigns in the targeted population was moderate to high (range: 52-119%), the coverage at
311  the county-level was much lower. The median first-dose administrative coverage at the county-
312  level was 18% (IQR: 4-41%) (Figure 2).
313
314  Among 25 campaigns conducted reactively (i.e., in response to cases), only 6 occurred before
315  the county-specific peak week of cases. In 2014 and 2015, 4/6 campaigns occurred before the
316  peak as compared to 2/19 campaigns in 2016 and 2017 (Figures 2 & S1). Five campaigns took
317  place after the last suspected case in a county epidemic, all in 2017. All five counties with
318  vaccination campaigns in 2014 or 2015 reported cases during the 2016/2017 wave, though it is
319  unclear if these were in the same sub-county populations. Counties with campaigns occurring
320  after the county-level epidemic peak had, on average, 2.4 (95% CI: 1.8-3.2) times higher attack
321  rates compared to those where vaccine campaigns occurred before the peak, even after
322  adjusting for vaccine coverage and epidemic wave.
323
324  Molecular Analyses
325  Results from phylogenetic analyses (Figure 3, Figure S2), MLVA, and antibiotic resistance
326  testing (Figure S3) all suggest that the bacteria circulating during the study period were nearly
327  identical V. cholerae O1 Inaba strains with the ctxB1 genotype. Our phylogenetic analysis
328  looked more closely at previously-published T10 lineage sequences from several African
329  countries, including the fourteen sequences from South Sudan within this clade.14,15 We added
330  seven recently-published T10 sequences from Uganda in the same phylogenetic tree to better
331  understand the relationship between V. cholerae in these neighboring countries.16 All fourteen
332  whole genome sequences from South Sudan epidemics between 2014 and 2017,15 from
333  patients in Central Equatoria State and Eastern Equatoria State, had extremely similar
334  sequences. Across these fourteen sequences, there are 21 polymorphic sites (~3% of the
335  diversity observed in the T10 lineage), with no more than 10 SNPs between any two
336  sequences (Figure 3). These sequences all belonged to the T10 lineage, which has circulated
                                                                                                                                   14

337  in the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than twenty years (Figure S1), was first
338  observed in Uganda in 1998, and is distinct from the T13 lineage recently reported in East and
339  Southern Africa and Yemen.14,29 Four sequences from Uganda in 2014–2015 cluster closely
340  with all fourteen sequences from South Sudan.
341
342  MLVA analysis on 150 V. cholerae isolates collected from 12 different counties in 7 different
343  states in 2014 (46), 2015 (27), 2016 (42), and 2017 (35) showed that all isolates were from the
344  same clonal complex (Figure S3A). Ten isolates collected in Uganda in 2014 also belonged to
345  the same clonal complex. Nearly all isolates had identical antibiotic resistance profiles,
346  including resistance to colistin, nitrofurantoin, polymyxin B, streptomycin, sulfonamides,
347  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Figure S3B).
348
349  The Role of Precipitation
350  Over 90% of average annual precipitation during 2010-2018 occurred between March and
351  November, both nationally and in Juba County (Figure S4A). Rainfall in 2014–2017 differed
352  little from that in 2010–2013, when no cholera was reported within the country, despite a 2014–
353  2016 El Niño-event.30 With the exception of 2017, the rainy season preceded the detection of
354  cases every year, with cases in Juba County typically reported in closest proximity (2-10
355  weeks) to the start of the heavy rains (Figure S4B). In Juba County, we found no significant
356  association between accumulated rainfall over 7 days and the instantaneous basic
357  reproductive number in the subsequent 10 days (Figure S5, S6). Though we did not extend this
358  analysis to all counties, it is noteworthy how this finding contrasts with those from analyses of
359  cholera in in Yemen using similar methods.21
360
361  The Role of Population Movement
362  Between 2014 and 2017, the IOM estimated that over 760,000 individuals moved between
363  counties in South Sudan or immigrated from a neighboring country (Table S2). In 2017,
                                                                                                                                    15

364  movement increased nearly two-fold (2014: 164,119, 2015: 154,840, 2016: 166,864, 2017:
365  274,965). Most movement was between counties (553,689) with substantial international
366  migration from Ethiopia (3,025), Democratic Republic of Congo (4,653), Kenya (16,876), Sudan
367  (87,175), and Uganda (95,370).
368
369  The movement of people from counties reporting cholera was generally consistent with the
370  year-to-year geographic extent of each wave (Figure 4, Figure S7). In 2014, movement from
371  Juba County, where the first cases were reported, was primarily eastward with little movement
372  north. That same year, cholera was primarily reported in and around Central Equatoria State
373  and in Eastern Equatoria State. In 2015, there was far less movement from Juba County
374  outwards (66% fewer people leaving Juba County than in 2014), and the epidemic remained
375  geographically limited. In 2016 and 2017, movement up and down the Nile River increased
376  dramatically including an increase in movement from Juba County northwards along the river.
377  During this same period, cholera cases were reported from nearly every county along the Nile.
378  In addition to internal migration, more than 110,000 returnees came from Kenya and Uganda,
379  particularly in 2016/17 when both countries reported cholera (Figure S8).
380
381  Discussion
382
383  Between 2014–2017, South Sudan experienced three distinct epidemic waves of cholera, all
384  beginning in Juba County. Genotypic and phenotypic analyses indicate that despite periods of
385  no reported cases in between each wave, all were of the same clonal origin and most closely
386  related to V. cholerae O1 circulating in Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo. Each wave
387  occurred soon after the onset of the rainy season though rainfall was not associated with
388  increased transmission in Juba County. Movements of internally displaced people and
389  returnees were consistent with spatial patterns of cholera, although we could not quantify this
390  association due to the resolution of the data.
                                                                                                                                   16

391
392  Cholera was likely introduced into South Sudan in 2013 or early 2014 through cross-border
393  human population movement.11 It remains unclear whether V. cholerae O1 remained in South
394  Sudan in between waves through undetected transmission (e.g., insensitive surveillance or
395  asymptomatic carriers), persistence in the environment, or if it was reintroduced. Given the
396  magnitude of population movement between Uganda and South Sudan, reported cases in
397  Uganda during the lull periods in South Sudan, increased surveillance efforts in South Sudan,
398  and the genetic similarity between Ugandan and South Sudanese isolates, repeated cross-
399  border transmission events may be the most plausible explanation. This highlights the need for
400  a regional approach to fighting cholera: efforts to slow an outbreak in one country could be
401  undone by introductions from elsewhere.
402
403  For each wave, the first suspected cases in Juba County were detected shortly after the onset
404  of the rainy season. Flooded infrastructure or changes in human behavior around the time of
405  the rainy season likely led to conditions favorable to the propagation of V. cholerae O1 in Juba
406  County. Interestingly, increases in rainfall once the rainy season had begun were not
407  associated with increases in transmission in Juba, suggesting rain may have played a role in
408  triggering but not amplifying the outbreaks. In each wave, Juba County was the first county
409  (except narrowly in 2016) to report suspected cases of cholera in the country and likely played
410  an important role in maintaining cholera outbreaks in the country due to the size of the
411  population and the significant population movement in and out of the city (Figure 4, S6).28 Juba
412  County had >44% of weeks from 2014-2018 with suspected cholera cases and a mean annual
413  incidence of 2.6 per 1,000, making it a clear ‘burden hotspot,’ as defined by the GTFCC (Figure
414  S9).
415
416  Both increased human migration and transmission occurring during the dry season might
417  partially explain why the 2016-2017 outbreak spread more broadly across the country. In July
                                                                                                                                   17

418  2016, intense fighting began in Juba County, causing mass population displacement towards
419  swampy areas along the Nile river and to Uganda. At the same time, the number of cases in
420  Juba County was skyrocketing and cases began to be reported from a number of counties
421  adjacent to the river.31 Cholera persisted during the dry season only in counties along the river
422  (Figure S10). Though the reason for continued transmission remains unclear, most of these
423  communities had not reported cholera cases in recent years and presumably had low
424  population-level immunity. The large geographic extent at the end of the dry season may have
425  then created conditions where cholera transmission could be easily amplified as heavy rains
426  arrived. Similar dynamics were noted in Yemen where cholera expanded geographically during
427  the dry season with cases exploding when rainfall increased.21
428
429  The massive use of cholera vaccine (both reactively and proactively) in South Sudan highlights
430  some of the challenges in implementing campaigns, especially in humanitarian settings.
431  Cholera control efforts during these outbreaks was continually hampered by conflicts and
432  limited access to areas with ongoing transmission. Of the 2,068,622 doses used reactively,
433  only 6.4% were part of campaigns initiated before the peak of the epidemic in the target county.
434  Due to the global shortage of vaccine supply, campaigns were often limited in size and rarely
435  covered the full population; only those deemed at the highest risk. Given the low coverage at
436  the county-level (though relatively high coverage in the target population), the spatial scale of
437  the most reliable epidemiologic data collected, and the relatively low testing rate among
438  suspected cases, the impact of vaccination on reducing incidence is unclear. Our simple
439  analyses exploring the relative attack rates in places that had OCV campaigns before and after
440  the peak provide hints of impact on the population-level but efforts to collect more spatially
441  resolved incidence data combined with systematic lab testing of suspected cholera cases will
442  allow for more precise quantification of vaccine impact.

444  This study comes with a number of limitations. We relied on reports of suspected cases from
445  reporting health structures across the country. However, due to the instability in the region,
446  some health centers may not have reported cases, and some people may not have sought
447  care for even severe disease. Isolates that underwent whole genome sequencing came
448  exclusively from the southern portion of the country and were not geographically
449  representative. However, MLVA analyses and the antibiotic sensitivity testing suggest similarity
450  of strains across the country. While interventions such as chlorination of public water sources,
451  hygiene promotion, and enforcement of sanitation standards in public areas did occur, we were
452  unable to identify datasets to quantify the role of these services. Lastly, the population
453  displacement data were at an annual temporal scale and did not cover the entire country, thus
454  limiting our ability to have precise quantitative estimates of the contribution of movement as
455  shown with cell phone data or theoretical models in other settings. 32,33. Despite these
456  limitations, trends of mass migration and spread of cholera were largely consistent.
457
458  Cholera has not been reported in South Sudan from November 2017 through the time of last
459  editing this manuscript (19-September-2020), which may be explained by a combination of
460  natural and vaccine-derived immunity, reduced displacement, and perhaps improved sanitary
461  conditions. Estimated water and sanitation indicators remain poor in South Sudan with only
462  36.7% having access to improved water and 9.9% having access to improved sanitation in
463  2017.2 South Sudan will likely continue to remain at risk of introductions of cholera from other
464  countries in the region followed by large-scale spread. Broad use of oral cholera vaccine
465  combined with local WASH interventions may provide a stopgap over the coming years to
466  block transmission, while much needed investments in water and sanitation are made.
467  However, in South Sudan, peace is likely the first prerequisite to long-lasting cholera
468  prevention.

470  Through better understanding of how cholera spreads and the complex roles of human
471  movement, climate, and cholera-specific interventions, we can potentially plan for quicker and
472  appropriately targeted cholera control measures in future cholera epidemics in South Sudan
473  and beyond. Such advances in humanitarian emergencies may be critical to achieving
474  progress towards the 2030 cholera goals of reducing cholera as a public health threat.

611  which were suspected cholera cases. Blue arrows (B) represent the number of
612  internally displaced persons and returnees moving between counties. Purple arrows
613  (C) represent the expected number of exported cholera cases estimated by multiplying
614  the attack rate of each county by the number of people leaving that county to another
615  location for the same time period. Higher intensity of population movement and
616  exported cases are indicated by darker colors on the log10 scale. Counties in grey were
