 1     Global projections of potential lives saved from COVID-19 through
 2     universal mask use

 4     Abstract
 5     Background: Social distancing mandates have been effective at reducing the health impacts of COVID-
 6     19. The ensuing economic downturns and unemployment increases have led many nations to
 7     progressively relax mandates. As COVID-19 transmission and deaths rise in many low and middle-income
 8     countries (LMICs), with continuing widespread transmission elsewhere, policymakers are searching for
 9     options to reduce COVID-19 mortality without re-imposing strict social distancing mandates.
10     Methods: Using a Bayesian meta-regression of 40 studies measuring the impact of mask use on
11     respiratory viral infections, we estimated the reduction in transmission associated with the use of cloth
12     or paper masks used in a general population setting. We used data from daily surveys conducted by
13     Facebook, YouGov, and Premise, on the proportion of people reporting always wearing a mask outside
14     their home for nearly all countries. We predicted deaths and infections until January 1st 2021 under a
15     reference and universal mask use scenario using a deterministic transmission dynamics model with
16     categories for susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered (SEIR). In the reference scenario, we assume
17     continued easing of mandates but with action to re-impose mandates for a period of six weeks, at a
18     level of eight daily deaths per million population. The universal mask scenario assumed scaling up of
19     mask use to 95% over a one-week period.
20     Findings: Use of simple masks can reduce transmission of COVID-19 by 40% (95% uncertainty interval
21     [UI] 20% – 54%). Universal mask use would lead to a reduction of 815,600 deaths (95% UI 430,600 to
22     1,491,000 deaths) between August 26th 2020 and January 1st 2021, the difference between the
23     predicted 3.00 million deaths (95% UI 2.20 to 4.52 million) in the reference and 2.18 million deaths (95%
                                                                            1

24     UI 1.71 to 3.14 million) in the universal mask scenario over this time period. Mask use was estimated at
25     59.0% of people globally on August 18th, ranging from 41.9% in North Africa and the Middle East to
26     79.2% in Latin America and the Caribbean. The effect of universal mask use is greatest in countries such
27     as India (158,832 fewer deaths in universal mask scenario, 95% UI 75,152 to 282,838 deaths), the United
28     States of America (93,495 fewer deaths; 95% UI 59,329 to 150,967 deaths), and Russia (68,531 fewer
29     deaths; 95% UI 34,249 to 145,960 deaths).
30     Interpretation: The rising toll of the COVID-19 pandemic can be substantially reduced by the universal
31     adoption of masks. This low-cost policy, whether customary or mandated, has enormous health benefits
32     and likely large economic benefits as well, by delaying the need for re-imposition of social distancing
33     mandates.

35     Research in context
36     Evidence before this study
37     One meta-analysis of 21 studies reported a pooled reduction in the risk of respiratory virus infection of
38     47% (95% CI 36-79%) from a subset of eight studies reporting on mask use in non-health workers but it
39     did not distinguish type of mask. Another meta-analysis reported on 26 studies of mask use in health
40     workers and three studies in non-healthcare settings, reported a pooled effect of a 66% (55-74%)
41     reduction in infections and a reduction by 44% (21-60%) in the three non-healthcare setting studies.
42     Several survey series regularly measure self-reported mask use but results from these different sources
43     have not previously been pooled to derive daily estimates of mask use over the course of the epidemic.
44     Global models of the impact of scaled up mask use have to our knowledge not been published.
45     Added value of this study
46     We combined the studies on mask use identified in the two meta-analyses and added one further study.
47     In a Bayesian meta-regression approach, we derived the effect of simple cloth or paper masks used
48     outside of a healthcare setting. In the meta-regression we make use of all the information provided by
49     all of these studies, rather than subsetting to just those studies that provided the direct comparison of
50     interest. Pooling estimates on the prevalence of self-reported mask use from three survey series
51     provides up-to-date information on trends in mask use in almost all countries. We use extensive survey
52     data covering nearly every country in the world to assess recent trends and current mask use. We then
53     use an SEIR transmission dynamics model with good predictive validity to assess the potential of scaled
54     up mask use to reduce global mortality from COVID-19.
55     Implications of all the available evidence
56     Universal mask use can save many lives and avoid or, at least, delay the need for re-imposition of social
57    mandates (such as stay-at-home orders, curfews, etc.), which would also contribute to ameliorating the
58    negative effects of COVID-19 on the economy and unemployment. Until an affordable vaccine becomes
59    universally available, mandating mask use is the most attractive policy option available to all countries,
                                                                          3

60     particularly if an expected increased transmission risk occurs in the Northern hemisphere’s fall and
61     winter. Simple face coverings are cheap and effective; one of the few available interventions that is
62     widely available to everyone. Countries with currently low mask use will need to determine the optimal
63     balance between encouraging the use of masks through advocacy and information about their benefits,
64     and governance of a compulsory use associated with penalties for non-compliance.

66     Introduction
67     COVID-19 has spread to all regions of the world and as of August 30th 2020, with over 25 million cases
68     and 845,414 deaths have been reported globally1. This is undoubtedly an underestimate and only one
69     direct measure, among many, that may be used to refer to the impact of the pandemic on health and
70     health systems around the world. In March 2020, nearly all nations put in place a set of social distancing
71     mandates that have contributed to blunting the effects of COVID-19. Economic downturns and the
72     associated mass unemployment caused by these measures has led most nations to progressively relax
73     social distancing mandates. As COVID-19 transmission and deaths rise in many low and middle-income
74     countries (LMICs) and some high-income countries, policymakers are keen to identify policy options to
75     reduce COVID-19 mortality without re-imposing strict social distancing mandates.
76     One attractive strategy is the imposition of mandates requiring the wearing of masks in public spaces
77     when physical distancing is not feasible. Initially, the World Health Organization (WHO) discouraged
78     mask use by public questioning of the evidence supporting general use and arguing it might lead to mask
79     shortages for healthcare providers2,3. Several systematic reviews, however, have suggested that cloth
80     and other non-medical masks worn by the general public can markedly reduce transmission.4,5 A
81     growing number of national and local governments have recently adopted mask use mandates, with
82     now over 150 countries mandating mask use either nationally, or in specific transmission hotspots,
83     focused in enforcing their use within on public transit or indoor public spaces.6 In nations such as the
84     United States (US) and Brazil, mask use has become a political issue, with widely varying viewpoints on
85     the ethics, legality and enforcement of mask use mandates.7,8 Evidence of the individual benefits,
86     population health impacts, and the potential economic benefits of increased mask use may be a useful
87     input in these national debates.
88     Masks can affect the transmission of respiratory pathogens in a number of ways, thereby providing a
89     complement to stringent social distancing mandates without the associated severe economic impacts,
                                                                          5

 90     and in settings such as indoor public spaces where distancing may not be possible. Simple cloth masks
 91     are also affordable and equitably accessible. At the individual level masks reduce transmission via a
 92     physical barrier whereby the force of exhalation, coughing, or sneezing leads to impaction and
 93     interception of viral droplets (> 5µm in diameter) and aerosol (≤ 5 µm in diameter, resulting from
 94     evaporation of expired droplets, also described as droplet nuclei) onto the fibers of the mask.9–11 Given
 95     greater impaction efficiency for droplets, masks are most effective in blocking outward exhalation12,
 96     although evidence from studies of air pollution aerosol indicates some protection of non-medical masks
 97     in blocking a small fraction of aerosol inhalation.13 Thus mask wearing is effective both for the infected
 98     and the uninfected14 and is also relevant to the recent discussions regarding airborne transmission of
 99     SARS-CoV-2.15 Airborne transmission is, by definition, caused by droplet nuclei (i.e. evaporated droplets)
100     that may remain infectious when suspended in the air over extended distances or time periods.11 As
101     masks can effectively block exhalation of droplets, they also reduce production of droplet nuclei by
102     evaporation, and therefore offer a practical intervention against airborne transmission to complement
103     ventilation and less widely accessible interventions such as air filtration and UV disinfection.
104     In this paper, we provide a meta-regression of the reduction in transmission associated with mask use,
105     use survey data to assess current levels and trends in use of masks globally, and quantify the benefits of
106     universal mask use (here defined as 95% of individuals always wearing a mask when outside their home)
107     on COVID-19 mortality using a COVID-19 transmission dynamics model. We provide estimates of lives
108     saved through universal mask use globally and at the national level between July 26th 2020 and January
109     1st 2021.

111     Methods
112     Our analysis is comprised of three main components: a literature scoping analysis and meta-regression
113     of the benefits of mask use with an emphasis on non-medical mask use amongst the general (non-
114     healthcare) population; an analysis of survey data on the levels and trends in mask use; and modeling
115     two scenarios (reference and universal mask use) of COVID-19 incidence and death using a deterministic
116     transmission dynamics model with categories for susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered (SEIR).
117     Each component is discussed in more detail below.
118     Estimating the effectiveness of masks in preventing transmission
119     We performed a meta-regression of 63 observations from 40 studies of the effectiveness of masks in
120     preventing the transmission of respiratory virus infections. These studies were included in two published
121     meta-analyses4,5 with one further study of mask use for COVID-19 in the general population added.16
122     The studies varied in setting (general population versus healthcare), type of mask (which we
123     dichotomized into medical-grade masks, including surgical and N95 masks, and non-medical masks,
124     including cloth masks), comparator group (no mask use or “occasional” mask use), type of diagnosis
125     (clinical or laboratory), country of study (dichotomized into Asian and non-Asian countries) and type of
126     respiratory virus (SARS-CoV-1 or 2 versus H1N1, influenza, or other respiratory viruses); details on the
127     details of all included studies16–55 can be found in SI Table 2 in the Appendix. From the identified papers,
128     we extracted all relevant observations that assessed mask effectiveness, allowing for multiple
129     observations per study based on variations in mask type, virus studied, or comparison group. From the
130     two meta-analyses, four identified studies were excluded where a relative risk was not available56,57, we
131     were unable to extract mask use from general PPE use58, or because the comparison group was of less
132     protective masks rather than no or infrequent mask use59. In order to derive the most relevant pooled
133     estimate for the effect of mask use on preventing the spread of COVID-19 in populations, we performed
134     a meta-regression of all 63 observations and their characteristics to predict the effect of non-medical
                                                                           7

135     mask use in a community setting to prevent laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 compared to no use of
136     masks. For studies with zero counts in the numerator, we used a continuity correction of 0.001 to
137     estimate the RR in order to ensure inclusion in our analyses; sensitivity analyses considering other
138     continuity corrections produced highly consistent results (see Appendix). To generate summary
139     estimates we used a custom Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression tool (MR-BRT – “meta-regression –
140     Bayesian, regularized, trimmed”)60 which accounted for between-study heterogeneity in the width of
141     the uncertainty interval (see Appendix for more details).
142     Past, current and future prevalence of mask use
143     We used three main sources of data on self-reported use of masks: the Facebook Global Symptom
144     Survey61, the PREMISE surveys62, and the YouGov COVID-19 Behaviour Tracker surveys.63 Between April
145     23rd and August 18th, Facebook has surveyed 23.3 million Facebook users from 102 countries using an
146     instrument with multiple items on behaviours related to COVID-19, including mask use. For the US, we
147     used data collected through PREMISE. There were 190,216 total PREMISE responses representing all 50
148     states and the District of Columbia with responses collected between April 21st and August 21st. The
149     YouGov surveys cover 29 countries and have interviewed around 493,400 individuals since March 1st and
150     up until August 8th 2020. From the Facebook surveys, we used the item: “In the last 7 days, how often
151     did you wear a mask when in public?” to which there are the following responses “All of the time; Most
152     of the time; About half of the time; Sometimes; Never; I have not been in public during the last 7 days”.
153     Respondents for “All of the time” were the numerator in our proportion. From the PREMISE surveys, we
154     use the following question: “When you leave your home do you typically wear a face mask
155     (SELECT_ONE)” with responses “Yes, always; Yes, sometimes; No never”. Respondents for “Yes, always”
156     were the numerator in our proportion. From YouGov, we use the following question: “Thinking about
157     the last 7 days, have you worn a face mask outside your home (e.g. when on public transport, going to a
                                                                           8

159     “Not at all”. Respondents for “Always” were the numerator in our proportion.
160     Mask use for each location was estimated using a spline-based smoothing process. This smoothing
161     process averages each data point with five neighboring data points. To arrive at smooth, flat values at
162     the ends of the observed data, we computed the average of the change in mask use over the three
163     following days (left tail) and three preceding days (right tail). For locations without data on mask use, we
164     used, in order of preference, national level estimates (for subnational locations), regional estimates, and
165     super-regional estimates based on the regional groupings used by the Global Burden of Disease Study
166     (GBD). The only exception was for countries in Oceania, a region where no data are available through
167     any of the three survey platforms. In the GBD hierarchy, these countries are part of the East Asia and
168     Southeast Asia super-region; however, mask use in Oceania is likely to be more similar to mask use in
169     Australia and New Zealand and so the mask use from that region was used for countries in Oceania.
170     To construct our scenario of universal mask use, we assume that current mask use in all locations would
171     increase to 95% over the course of 7 days. We use 95% as that is the highest level of mask use reported
172     at the national level to date during the COVID-19 pandemic; this level was reported in Singapore. Our
173     “universal mask use” scenario assumes that this level of mask use can be achieved through the adoption
174     and enforcement of mask use mandates around the world.
175     COVID-19 SEIR model construction for each location
176     The IHME COVID-19 prediction model has been described in detail elsewhere.64 For the results
177     presented in this analysis, the SEIR part of the model are most relevant. We construct an SEIR model for
178     each location we model; the Appendix shows the basic states included in the model and the transition
179     parameters. The critical driver of the epidemic is the rate at which susceptible individuals become
180     infected in each location which is assumed to be represented as:
                                                                           9

181     Where βt is the transmission parameter for time period t, 𝛼𝛼 represents a mixing coefficient to account
182     for imperfect mixing within each location, S is the fraction of each location’s population that is
183     susceptible, and I1 and I2 is the fraction that are infectious. Effective Rt, the number of new infections
184     caused by each case is a simple monotonic transformation of βt and the fraction of the population that is
185     susceptible. We use an efficient algorithm to directly estimate βt in the past – see appendix for details.
186     To determine the strength of the relationship between β t and various covariates, we perform a log-
187     linear regression using the open source mixed effects solver SLIME5. All covariates are assumed to have
188     fixed effects while the intercept is allowed to vary by location. For location 𝑙𝑙, the regression is calculated

193     regression and a row for each day, and 𝜶𝜶 is the coefficient indicating the strength of the relationship
194     between log 𝛽𝛽 and each of the covariates. We tested many covariates and included the following in the
195     model: population density measured as the share of the population living in areas with more than 2,500
196     individuals per square kilometer, the fraction of the population living below 100 meters above sea level,
197     smoking prevalence, particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5 population-weighted annual average
198     concentration), mobility measured using cell phone apps, mask use, COVID-19 testing per capita, and
199     pneumonia seasonality. Pneumonia seasonality was constructed as an index using medical certification
200     of cause of death data on pneumonia deaths by week and normalized annually. In locations without 4-
201     or 5-star quality cause of death data65, we used latitude as a predictor of the pattern of pneumonia
202     seasonality. To avoid over-estimating the effects of pneumonia seasonality and mask use we used
203     constraints on each in the regression – see Appendix for details. Specifically, for mask use, we did not let
                                                                              10

204     the regression estimate an effect size larger than what was consistent with the mask use meta-analysis
205     of the individual level effect. To capture uncertainty in the input data, model parameters and regression
206     coefficients linking βjt to covariates, we generated 1,000 models for each location – see Appendix for
207     details.
208     We evaluated out of sample predictive validity for this modeling approach by holding out the last five
209     weeks of data and compared predictions from the held-out data to what occurred; median absolute
210     percent error for cumulative deaths at five weeks was 7%.66 We also compared this model to other
211     COVID-19 prediction models that make their estimates publicly available; overall, we find that our model
212     has the best performance at 5- and 6-weeks out-of-sample.66
213     We used the set of 1,000 SEIR models for each location to generate two types of scenarios: a reference
214     scenario and a universal mask use scenario. In the reference scenario, or what we think is most likely to
215     occur, key drivers such as mobility and testing per capita evolve according to past trends – see Appendix
216     for details. In the universal mask use scenario, we assume that mask mandates and other campaigns
217     lead to scale-up of mask use to 95% within seven days of enactment. We also assume both in the
218     reference and in the universal mask use scenario that social distancing mandates would be re-imposed
219     when the daily death rate reaches eight per million people per day. This daily death rate represents the
220     90th percentile across countries of the observed daily death rate in the past few months before each
221     country imposed the maximum number of social distancing mandates. This daily death rate also
222     represents the observed average daily death rate to date among the small number of locations that are
223     experiencing a resurgence and are re-imposing social distancing mandates.

224     Results
225     Figure 1 shows the relative risk of viral respiratory infection among users of different types of
226     facemasks. Studies of general population use (13 observations of 63 total) included cluster randomized
227     trials of household member mask use living with an infected individual, cohort analyses of close contacts
228     of infected individuals, and case control analyses of mask use prior to infection amongst the general
229     population or of secondary infections amongst household members of an infected individual. A total of
230     19 observations were of non-medical masks, with eight of these focused on use by the general public.
231     The meta-regression suggested the benefits of non-medical masks in the general population to be a 40%
232     (UI 20% – 54%) reduction in transmission. The benefits of wearing surgical or medical masks in the
233     general population were slightly larger, a 43% reduction (23% - 59%) in transmission. Even larger
234     reductions in transmission were estimated for non-medical (54% [40%-64%] and medical (56% [48%-
235     64%]) mask use amongst healthcare worker populations. More details are provided in the Appendix.
236     Based on survey data collected through smartphone hosted questionnaires, Figure 2 shows a map of
237     mask use by location as of August 18th, the last date of fully observed data in the model. Mask use is
238     high in most parts of Latin America and South-East and East Asia. The highest mask use on August 18th
239     was in Chile (93.6%), followed by Puerto Rico (93.5%), and Guatemala (92.2%). The lowest rates are seen
240     in Northern Europe (Sweden, Norway, and Denmark < 1%) and North Africa (Tunisia 6.5%). Lower rates
241     are seen in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Northern Europe, and states and provinces in the United
242     States, Canada, and Australia. Mask use is highest among people who live in cities and lowest in people
243     who live in rural communities (see Appendix).
244     Figure 3 shows the global and super-region trends in mask use since the beginning of the epidemic.
245     Mask use data start only in the beginning of April so the rapid expansion from likely a very low baseline
246     pre-COVID-19 outside of East Asia most probably occurred in March. Mask use was estimated at 59.0%
247     of people globally on August 18th, ranging from 41.9% in North Africa and the Middle East to 79.2% in
                                                                          12

248     Latin America and the Caribbean (Figure 3). Mask use has increased in some locations where mandates
249     have been put into place such as Australia, Belgium, and the United Kingdom (SI Figure 7). Mask use has
250     declined in some settings where death rates are declining such as Poland, Czechia, and Italy (SI Figure 7).
251     Mask use varied by gender in some regions, with higher use by females in all regions except for South
252     Asia, (globally 54.2% in females vs to 52.3% in males) and by age with generally lower use amongst 18-
253     24 year olds (50.0%) and those over 65 years (46.4%) compared to 55-54 year old adults (56.5%) who
254     were the most likely to wear masks (percentages on July 21, see Appendix).
255     Global projections of COVID-19 deaths with and without a universal mask use mandate are shown in
256     Figure 4. In our reference scenario, we expect daily COVID-19 deaths to increase in October through
257     December leading to 3.00 million deaths (95% UI 2.20 to 4.52 million) by January 1st 2021. Uncertainty in
258     daily deaths and cumulative deaths widens steadily over time such that there is considerable
259     uncertainty in global deaths by January 1st. In contrast, the universal mask use scenario leads to a mean
260     estimate of 2.18 million deaths (95% UI 1.71 to 3.14 million) by January 1st. The difference in mortality
261     between the reference and universal mask use scenario suggests that 0.82 million lives (95% UI 0.43 to
262     1.49 million) could be saved over this time period if 95% of people were to always wear masks when
263     outside their home. Table 1 provides estimates by location of the expected deaths in the reference and
264     universal mask use scenario along with the number of deaths saved through the mask use mandate. The
265     countries where mask mandates would have the largest effect are populous countries such as India
266     (158,832 fewer deaths in universal mask scenario, 95% UI 75,152 to 282,838 deaths), the United States
267     of America (93,495 fewer deaths; 95% UI 59,329 to 150,967 deaths), and Russia (68,531 fewer deaths;
268     95% UI 34,249 to 145,960 deaths). The greatest magnitude difference in mortality rate occurred in the
269     Netherlands (23,282 fewer deaths, 136 deaths per 100,000), Switzerland (6,062 fewer deaths, 86 deaths
270     per 100,000).

271     Figure 5 shows a map of the percent reduction in expected deaths from the reference scenario
272     compared to the mask use scenario in the deaths from August 28th to January 1st. The largest percent
273     reduction in expected deaths occurred in Tanzania (80.4% difference, 95% UI 63.4 to 94.4%), Poland
274     (78.8% difference, 95% UI 60.4 to 93.5%), and Algeria (78.4% difference, 95% UI 61.9 to 92.2%).
275     Expected deaths were greater in the universal mask use scenario than in the reference scenario in some
276     locations due to the delay in re-imposition of mandates such as in Kazahkstan (more deaths in mask use
277     scenario, 95% UI 7.2 to 45.3% increase). There are large variations in the number of lives saved globally,
278     regionally, nationally, and subnationally and these are detailed in full in Table 1.
279
280     Discussion
281     Wearing a mask reduces the risk of contracting COVID-19 for individuals by 40% (20%-54%). Given global
282     mask use is currently at 59.0%, increasing mask use to 95% through mandates could decrease
283     cumulative COVID-19 deaths by January 1st 2021 by 0.82 million deaths (95% UI 0.43 to 1.49 million).
284     This represents a 26.5% reduction in the number of deaths expected from August 28th to January 1st
285     2021. The benefits of increased mask use are greatest in settings with ongoing substantial transmission
286     and low current levels of mask use regardless of sociodemographic status. Our models also show that in
287     many settings, increased mask use will delay the need re-imposition of social distancing mandates by
288     many weeks or even months; in addition to the lives saved, a delay in re-imposition of social mandates
289     might also be accompanied by substantial economic benefits.
290     The estimate of 40% effectiveness of non-medical mask use by the general public is based on 13
291     observations (from 9 studies) specific to the general population, from a total of 63 observations from 40
292     separate studies included in the meta-regression. The uncertainty interval is wide, from 20% to 54%
293     reduction in transmission. Even with this uncertainty interval, there was absolutely no indication of any
                                                                          14

294     harmful impacts of mask use, such as tendencies for engaging in riskier behaviour or self-contamination
295     via more frequent face touching, as has been suggested.67,68 Further, the published studies of SARS-CoV-
296     2 included in our analysis of mask effectiveness demonstrated reductions in relative risk of 30% - 100%,
297     with the one study of non-medical mask use amongst the general population, indicating a reduction of
298     42% for any mask use and 70% for consistent mask use.69 Mask effectiveness is also supported by
299     additional evidence from laboratory studies that report on the efficacy of masks in reducing exhalation
300     of both aerosols and droplets by those infected with SARS CoV-2.70 Further, a recent case series
301     reported no secondary infections among 139 individuals exposed to two symptomatic hair stylists with
302     confirmed COVID-19 while both the stylists and their clients wore masks.71 In addition, a study of Swiss
303     soldiers indicated that physical distancing and use of medical masks led to no COVID-19 symptoms
304     despite the presence of virus-specific antibodies72, while a study of healthcare workers indicated that
305     universal use of medical masks was associated with lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests73. Based on
306     all types of available evidence, it seems critical to encourage mask use throughout the world as the
307     benefits can be substantial with low to zero contraindications. Guidance for specific materials, handling
308     of face coverings and other considerations is rapidly evolving as additional evidence emerges74.
309     At the population level, the regression analysis of the determinants of the transmission parameter
310     suggests a much larger effect of mask use than the one seen in the published studies. To avoid the risk
311     of over-stating the benefits of mask use in this analysis, however, we have constrained the regression to
312     yield results that are consistent with the range of the effect sizes found in the individual level studies. In
313     other words, the benefits of a universal mask use mandate could be substantially larger and what we
314     report here can be seen as a conservative estimate of the impact of mask use on lives saved.
315     Given that the cost of masks is very low, mask mandates and/or the promotion of mask use seems
316     prudent, as the risk of adopting these policies is minimal and the potential benefits very large. In
317     recognition of this, over the last few months we have seen the number of countries and territories with
                                                                          15

318     mask mandates in place increase substantially. Nevertheless, there remains reluctance to adopt mask
319     use and to impose mask mandates. In some settings, the current epidemiological context means that
320     mask wearing is not viewed as a necessary part of control, such as in Norway where the Norwegian
321     Institute of Public Health determined that, given their current low prevalence, “200,000 people would
322     need to wear facemasks to prevent one new infection per week.”75 In other settings however, despite
323     increasing cases, public sentiment towards mask wearing hinders universal utilization. Past messages
324     from some governments have not encouraged mask use and may have actually discouraged mask use.76–
325     78
           Early on, WHO stated “the wide use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not
326     supported by current evidence and carries uncertainties and critical risks”2 and only changed their official
327     position on June 5th to encourage mask use.79 This reluctance to embrace mask use given no real risks of
328     use and considerable potential health and economic benefits is hard to understand and justify. For those
329     decision-makers who are concerned with the economic effects of social distancing mandates, mask use
330     mandates provide a low-cost strategy to reduce the risk of a further round of social distancing mandates
331     and the associated unemployment and economic downturn.
332     While the effective R, the number of new infections created by a single infection under the auspices of
333     control, can potentially be reduced by one-third through universal mask use compared to no mask use,
334     mandates alone will likely be insufficient to control the epidemic in many locations. Even with universal
335     mask use, we expect the death toll due to COVID-19 to reach 2.18 million deaths by the end of the year,
336     and many more in 2021, assuming an efficacious vaccine is not discovered, licensed and widely deployed
337     in the interim. Countries will have to consider other policy strategies to reduce transmission, including
338     increasing testing, contact tracing, and isolation, along with “smart mandates”, which refers to targeting
339     mandates or restrictions to particular subgroups of the population, such as specific age-groups or local
340     communities for short periods of time. A central policy challenge for many countries is understanding
                                                                          16

341     which of these mandates targeting strategies makes the most sense in a given context and at what level
342     of COVID-19 transmission. This is the focus of our ongoing work.
343     The findings of this study should be interpreted while taking into account its limitations. First, there is a
344     set of limitations related to the meta-regression, including the following. The number of published
345     studies on the protection provided by cloth masks worn by the general public is limited. With rapid
346     development of the COVID-19 literature, new data on the effectiveness of masks can quickly be
347     incorporated into our meta-regression model. Future studies could change our pooled estimate of the
348     effect size and/or the large uncertainty interval around it in the meta-regression. As we looked at
349     multiple observations per study, it was not really feasible to account for all possible clustering. We
350     performed sensitivity analyses (shown in the Appendix) and found minimal differences in investigating
351     the role of clustering in our results. Studies had different endpoints and while we controlled for that in
352     our meta-regression, it would be ideal to have more studies that focus on COVID-19 as an endpoint.
353     Second, related to the modeling framework, we use an SEIR model to predict the course of the epidemic
354     with and without universal mask use. In general, SEIR models have tended to overestimate the
355     infections and deaths associated with COVID-19. Over-estimation is likely due to the fact that individuals
356     change their behaviours as the epidemic gets worse around them and governments tend to react when
357     hospital systems are nearing capacity. We have built the government response into our reference
358     scenario and have tried to use empirically observed data on mobility and current mask use to reflect the
359     individual behavioural response. Further, our model makes a number of simplifying assumptions
360     associated with mixing and transmission heterogeneity and as such, our conclusions must be considered
361     with these assumptions in mind. Also, we use a log-linear mixed regression which does not take into
362     account the potential for non-linear relationships We acknowledge that there are likely non-linear
363     relationships between some of the drivers of transmission and transmission intensity. Moreover, we
364     expect there to also be complex lagged relationships between covariates and transmission (e.g., fatigue
                                                                          17

365     related to duration of mandate altering its impact on transmission). Improving how our model uses
366     covariates to capture temporal variation in new infections is an open avenue of research.
367     Third, our out-of-sample predictive validity testing has shown that errors tend to progressively get larger
368     the longer the forecast, but has also shown that errors are much larger in settings where there are
369     fewer than 50 total deaths to date. For example, predictions from publicly available models for sub-
370     Saharan Africa have been particularly bad.66
371     Fourth, we assume cases and deaths are accurately reported by JHU except in Ecuador, Kazakhstan and
372     where excess mortality analyses have indicated substantial underreporting of COVID-19 deaths. Other
373     countries may not be detecting or reporting deaths and cases due to lack of testing or other
374     considerations. Overall, though, we believe that our prediction model performs well and where antibody
375     tests have been conducted at the population level, we have found our model based on deaths has
376     matched these results.64
377     Fifth, our models are sensitive to the trends in the last 7-14 days in deaths and somewhat sensitive to
378     the trend in cases. In settings where deaths and cases are steadily rising, the model will tend to have
379     large estimates of βt. If the rise in transmission is not captured by trends in mobility or other covariates,
380     the unexplained residual in the model increases and this is then reflected in the forecasts by day
381     through to January 1st. The reverse relationship also holds true for when there is a consistent downward
382     trend. The sensitivity of our model to data trends is a strength in that it makes our models reflect the
383     on-the-ground realities; it is also a challenge in the sense that our model results will change when there
384     are changes in recent transmission that are not captured by the covariates.
385     Sixth, we rely on self-reported data which is collected via mobile phone app-based surveys on use of
386     masks. In addition to the usual biases that accompany self-reported data, in this case we do not know

388     differently compared to settings without mask mandates. The respondents to app-based surveys are
389     also likely to not be a truly representative sample of the populations in each location. The degree to
390     which the respondents represent the general population varies across locations, and depends on the
391     prevalence of Facebook and other app use in each country. While this is a limitation of the data that are
392     currently available, we believe that given the samples tend to be biased towards more educated, urban,
393     and younger populations, the reported mask use is likely to be an over-estimate in these locations. If
394     this is true, then the estimates of the impact of expanding mask use to reach 95% coverage in these
395     populations would be an underestimate of the true effect of the intervention.
396     These limitations highlight important areas for improvement across the entire spectrum of research
397     related to COVID-19. There is a critical need for more and higher quality data across the spectrum of
398     information required to understand the trajectory of this pandemic, starting with better and higher-
399     quality information on the numbers of cases and deaths, to improved and more representative data on
400     use of masks among populations across the world, to additional studies that quantify the effect of face
401     coverings on transmission probability of SARS-COV2 among the general population, to better data on
402     social distancing mandates implemented in each location and the extent to which they are enforced. On
403     the modeling side, continued work on making modeling frameworks more flexible and including
404     alternative model specifications, as well as improving on how covariates are used to capture temporal
405     variation in new infections might lead to improvements in the performance of long-range forecasts. A
406     greater understanding of how the drivers of this pandemic interact with each other and affect
407     transmission probabilities is critical for influencing its trajectory over the next few months.
408     Conclusion
409     The COVID-19 epidemic is far from over. While a selection of therapeutics is showing promise, a vaccine
410     that can be deployed at global scale does not exist and is unlikely to be widely available in the near
                                                                          19

411     future. We expect more deaths in the second half of 2020 than were seen in the first six months. Not
412     only are there large epidemics unfolding in Latin America, the Middle-East and South Asia, but
413     seasonality suggests a second wave can be anticipated in the Northern Hemisphere. The rising toll of the
414     COVID-19 pandemic can be reduced by 0.82 million deaths in the next few months by the adoption of
415     universal mask mandates. This low-cost intervention that is available and accessible to all populations,
416     regardless of socio-economic status or other dimensions of inequity, has enormous health benefits and
417     might also lead to large economic benefits by delaying the need for re-imposition of social distancing
418     mandates. In global health we rarely encounter effective, low-cost, and universally available
419     interventions that can save lives: immediately, equitably and safely. Ensuring that individuals, as well as,
420     local, national and global decision makers are all doing everything in their power to achieve the highest
421     rates of mask use in all exposed populations is one of the best strategies available to us to mitigate the
422     toll of the pandemic in the months to come.
