         ABSTRACT
         Background
         Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly spread worldwide to become a pandemic. This
         study aimed to define the predictors of critical illness development within 28 days
         postadmission.
         Methods
         We conducted a prospective cohort study including 477 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients
         admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Istanbul from March 12 to May 12, 2020. The
         development of critical illness, e.g., invasive mechanical ventilation and/or death, was
         followed for a period of 28 days postadmission. Demographic characteristics, number of
         comorbidities, illness severity at admission defined by the WHO scale, vital signs, laboratory
         findings and period of admission to the hospital were independent variables. Cox
         proportional hazards analysis was performed, and the C-index was calculated.
         Results
         The median (IQR) age of the cohort was 55.0 (44.0-67.0) years, and 50.1% were male. The
         most common presenting symptoms were cough, dyspnea and fatigue. Overall, 65.2% of the
         patients had at least one comorbidity. Hydroxychloroquine was given to 99.2% of the
         patients. Critical illness developed in 45 (9.4%; 95% CI: 7.0%-12.4%) patients. In the
         multivariable analysis, age (HR: 1.05, p<0.001), number of comorbidities (HR: 1.33, p=0.02),
         procalcitonin ≥0.25 µg/L (HR: 2.12, p=0.03) and LDH ≥350 U/L (HR: 2.04, p=0.03) were
                                                                                                                                4

         independently associated with critical illness development. The WHO scale on admission was
         the strongest predictor of critical illness (HR: 4.15, p<0.001). Prognosis improved within the
         study period (p<0.05). The C-index of the model was 0.92.
         Conclusions
         Age, comorbidity number, WHO scale, LDH and procalcitonin were independently associated
         with critical illness development. Mortality from COVID-19 seems to be decreasing as the
         pandemic advances.

         INTRODUCTION
         The first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case in Turkey was diagnosed on 11 March
                 1
         2020.     As of 17 August 2020, a total of 249309 cases were confirmed with 5974 deaths.
         Although the daily case numbers have declined, approximately 1000 new cases are still
         diagnosed every day. Istanbul, a metropolis of approximately 16 million inhabitants, is the
         epicenter of COVID-19 in Turkey.
         The pandemic response in Turkey was led by a scientific council formed by the government.
         Hospitals acted according to the regularly updated guidelines published by the scientific
         council for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients. Admission to the hospital was
         recommended for patients over the age of 50 years and those with comorbid conditions,
         severe pneumonia, and/or laboratory values indicative of worse prognosis. All patients
         hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia were given empirical hydroxychloroquine treatment
                                                           2
         per the council’s recommendation.                   There is limited information on the prognosis of COVID-
         19 patients in Turkey.
         COVID-19 can progress differently among infected individuals, ranging from asymptomatic
                                                                         3
         carriage to respiratory failure leading to death.                 In a report of 72314 cases from China, the
                                                                                                            4
         spectrum of disease varied from mild (81%) and severe (14%) to critical (5%).                        In a recent
         systemic review and meta-analysis, the all-cause mortality rate of hospitalized COVID-19
                                                                                       5
         patients was 10%, with a predictive interval of 2% to 39%.                      The authors concluded that there
         was substantial between-study heterogeneity, which led to a large 95% predictive interval
         suggesting high uncertainty. Clearly, high-quality cohort studies with defined severity criteria
                                                                                                                                6

         and adequate follow-up times are needed.                        It is important to determine the critical illness
         outcomes and associated factors, which are vital to determine hospitalization criteria, which
                                                                         8
         in turn will affect medical resource allocation.
         Here, we describe the demographic characteristics, clinical features, 28-day critical illness
         development and factors associated with critical illness among COVID-19 patients treated in
         one of the main pandemic hospitals in Istanbul.

         METHOD
         Study setting and design
         We conducted a single-center, prospective cohort study. All hospitalized ≥18-year-old
         patients with confirmed COVID-19, i.e., positive RT-PCR assay for the SARS-CoV-2 genome
         detected in a nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab specimen were included. The
         study period started with the first confirmed patient in our hospital on March 12, 2020, and
         included patients hospitalized until May 12, 2020. Testing was performed on patients who
                                                                                                                         2
         fulfilled the criteria for possible COVID-19 according to the Turkish COVID-19 guideline.
         Essentially, patients whose symptoms and signs were compatible with viral pneumonia (e.g.,
         fever, cough, dyspnea or fatigue) and some cases based on clinical judgment were tested.
         The decision to admit a suspected COVID-19 patient to the hospital was mostly a clinical
         decision based on age, presence of comorbidity, dyspnea, hypoxia and extent of pulmonary
         involvement detected with thoracic CT.
         Study participants
         There were 521 patients hospitalized within the study period. The patients (n=55) who were
         transferred to or from our center were included in the study provided that their medical
         records could be retrieved from other centers. As the outcome was the development of
         critical illness, we excluded patients who had invasive mechanical ventilation and/or death
         within 24 hours of admission (n=41) (Figure 1). Healthcare-associated COVID-19 cases were
         also excluded (n=3). After these exclusions, 477 patients were eligible and followed-up for a
         period of 28 days postadmission.
                                                                                                                                8

         Data collection
         Demographic information, exposure history, comorbidities, comedications, symptoms, signs,
         imaging and PCR results, vital signs and clinical course including medications, response to
         treatments, laboratory parameters, intensive care unit (ICU) referral and prognosis were
         prospectively collected in forms standardized for COVID-19 patients. This information was
         then transferred to an electronic database, after which four physicians (US, PA, AT, HB) went
         through the data extensively, cross-checked the authenticity and completed missing
         information using archival and electronic records.
         Definition of the variables
         The outcome was progression to critical illness, which was either invasive mechanical
         ventilation or death within 28 days postadmission. To determine readmission status, the
         patients were reached by a phone call, and survival status was checked from a centralized
         electronic death registration system.
         The illness severity of the patients on the day of hospitalization was defined by the World
                                                                                                   9
         Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale for clinical improvement.                           This is an 8-point ordinal
         scale including 0, uninfected; 1, ambulatory with no limitation of activities; 2, ambulatory
         with limitation of activities; 3, hospitalized, mild disease, no oxygen therapy; 4, hospitalized,
         mild disease, oxygen by mask or nasal prongs; 5, hospitalized, severe disease, noninvasive
         ventilation or high-flow oxygen; 6, hospitalized, severe disease, intubation and mechanical
         ventilation; 7, hospitalized, severe disease, ventilation and additional organ support such as
         renal replacement therapy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; and 8, death.

         Although the minimum scale for hospitalization was 3, we had some patients with a score of
         2 who could have been followed in an ambulatory setting.
         Age, sex, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), number of comorbidities, vital signs,
         laboratory findings and period of admission to the hospital were the independent variables.
         For vital signs, the worst recorded value within the first 24 hours of hospitalization was
         recorded. The quick sepsis-related organ dysfunction assessment (qSOFA) score was also
                         10
         calculated.         The first available laboratory findings within 72 hours of hospital admission
         were noted. The period of admission to the hospital was categorized as two weekly periods
         within the study time.
         Statistics
         Descriptive statistics are presented as percentages and medians (IQRs). Categorical variables
         were compared with the chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests. Continuous variables for two
         independent groups were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test. Multivariable analysis was
         carried out with 451 (94.5%) of the 477 patients due to missing data. Cox proportional
         hazards with stepwise backward elimination was used, and the strengths of associations are
         presented as hazard ratios (HRs). Incidence rates and HRs were presented with 95%
         confidence intervals (CIs). The concordance index (C-index) was calculated. P<0.05 was
         considered statistically significant.
         Approval
         The study was approved by the ethics board of Marmara University, School of Medicine
         (09.2020.572). The requirement for written informed consent was waived by the board.

         RESULTS
         Overall, 477 patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were included in the analysis.
         The median (IQR) age of the cohort was 55.0 (44.0-67.0) years, and 239 (50.1%) were male.
         An exposure history with a possible/definitive COVID-19 case was present in 229 (48.0%)
         patients.
         The most common presenting symptom was cough followed by dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia,
         fever and headache (Table 1). All symptoms except dyspnea, diarrhea, rhinorrhea and
         confusion were significantly more common in patients younger than 60 years than in elderly
         patients (p<0.05 for all).
         Sociodemographic variables, comorbidities, smoking status, BMI, vital signs, laboratory
         findings and the period of hospital admission are presented in Table 2. At admission, 354
         (74.2%) cases were categorized as WHO scale 2&3, while 123 (25.8%) were categorized as
         WHO scale 4&5.
         Among the 477 patients, 61 (12.8%, 95%CI: 10.0%-16.1%) were admitted to the ICU. Forty
         patients (8.4%, 95%CI: 6.1%-11.2%) were intubated and mechanically ventilated. Thirty-four
         (7.1%, 95%CI: 5.0%-9.8%) patients died within the 28-day follow-up (Figure 1). Overall, 45
         (9.4%, 95% CI: 7.0%-12.4%) patients developed critical illness. The median (IQR) duration
         from hospital admission to invasive mechanical ventilation and death was 5.0 (3.0 – 8.8) and
         12.0 (8.0 – 20.0) days, respectively. The median (IQR) hospital length of stay was 7.0 (5.0 –
         11.0) days.
                                                                                                                              12

         Hydroxychloroquine alone and combined with azithromycin were administered to 473
         (99.2%) and 199 (41.7%) patients, respectively. Favipiravir (n=147, 30.8%) was used in
         patients with peripheral oxygen saturation ≤93% in ambient air. Oseltamivir was
         coadministered to 31 (6.5%) patients. Corticosteroid and tocilizumab were given to 46
         (9.6%) and 30 (6.3%) patients, respectively. Anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis with low-
         molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was given to 295 (61.8%) patients. While 14 (45.2%)
         patients were given LMWH prophylaxis in the first two weeks of the study period, this
         number increased to 62 (77.5%) in the last two weeks (p<0.001).
         Patients who progressed to critical illness were older and more likely to have comorbid
         conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease
         (Table 2). The development of critical illness was not associated with smoking status or BMI
         (p>0.05 for both). Patients who had progressed to critical illness were more likely to have a
         temperature ≥38°C, tachypnea and hypoxia at the time of hospital admission. Significantly
         more patients with qSOFA >1 progressed to critical illness than those with qSOFA ≤1.
         Patients progressing to critical illness had significantly higher rates of lymphopenia and
         higher C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, ferritin, d-dimer, fibrinogen, lactate
         dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin T levels (Table 2).
         In patients younger than 60 years old, the presence of comorbidity was a significant factor
         for the development of critical illness. Only one (0.7%) patient younger than 60 without
         comorbidity developed critical illness compared to 9 (6.2%) with comorbidity (p=0.02).

         The WHO scale for clinical improvement showed a significant association with the
         progression to critical illness. While 29.3% of patients with WHO scale 4&5 on admission
         progressed to critical illness, this rate was 2.5% for those with WHO scale 2&3 (p<0.001)
         (Figure 2). The rate of critical illness decreased significantly as the pandemic advanced.
         While 29.0% of patients who were hospitalized during the first two weeks of the pandemic
         progressed to critical illness, this rate was 2.5% for patients hospitalized during the last two
         weeks of the study period (p<0.001) (Figure 3).
         Univariable and multivariable analyses for progression to critical illness within the 28-day
         follow-up are presented in Table 3. Age, sex, number of comorbidities, WHO scale for clinical
         improvement, baseline laboratory values and period of admission to hospital were included
         in the multivariable model. Age was significantly associated with progression to critical
         illness; each year had an HR of 1.05 (95%CI: 1.02-1.08). The number of comorbidities was
         also independently associated with critical illness (HR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.05-1.68). Among the
         laboratory values, procalcitonin ≥0.25 µg/L (HR: 2.12, 95%CI: 1.07-4.21) and LDH ≥350 U/L
         (HR: 2.04, 95%CI: 1.06-3.94) were independently associated with critical illness. At
         admission, WHO scale of 4&5 had an HR of 4.15 (95%CI: 1.87-9.22) for progression to critical
         illness compared to WHO scale of 2&3. The risk of progression to critical illness decreased
         significantly as the hospitalization period advanced. Compared to the first period, the HR
         was 0.14 (95%CI: 0.03-0.72) in patients hospitalized during the last two weeks. The C-index
         of the model was 0.92.

         DISCUSSION
         This study describes the demographic characteristics, clinical features and prognosis of 477
         COVID-19 patients followed by a university hospital in Istanbul from mid-March to mid-May.
         The median age was 55.0 years (IQR 44.0-67.0), with an equal distribution of sexes. The 28-
         day mortality rate was 7.1%. The rate of progression to critical illness was 9.4%.
         Some studies with comparable characteristics of participants reported similar rates for the
         development of critical illness or death. A cohort study from China including patients with a
                                                                                                                           11
         mean age of 46.1 years reported a rate of 8% for the development of adverse outcomes.
         Another study from two hospitals in New York City including patients with a median age of
                                                                        12
         62.2 years revealed a mortality rate of 10.2%.                    Comparing these rates could be misleading
         due to the differences in the testing criteria influencing case identification, hospitalization
         indications and case mix across studies. Additionally, while some of the cohorts evaluated in-
         hospitality mortality, others focused on 14- or 28-day survival rates, which make
         comparisons even more problematic. Nevertheless, our rates for the development of critical
         illness seem somewhat lower than those of most of the studies, as Wiersinga et al. indicate
                                                                                                             3
         that the overall hospital mortality from COVID-19 is approximately 15%–20%.                           A major
         difference in our cohort was the extensive use of hydroxychloroquine. Whether
         hydroxychloroquine administration lowered the rates of critical illness development is
                                                     13
         beyond the scope of this study.

         The presenting symptoms were similar to those reported in other studies; cough, dyspnea
                                                             3
         and fatigue were the most common , and one-fifth of the patients reported anosmia and/or
                      14, 15
         ageusia.            Almost all symptoms were more common among patients <60 years than
         among elderly patients. This might be due to a predilection to hospitalize younger patients
         with more pronounced symptoms. This finding also suggests that presenting complaints
                                                                                                                       15
         might be subtler among elderly patients, as clinical presentation might vary with age.                           Sixty-
         five percent of the patients had at least one comorbidity, such as hypertension, diabetes or
                                                                                                           3
         cardiovascular disease, which is consistent with other studies’ findings.
         Univariable analysis revealed some risk factors for critical illness that were already described
                                  3, 6, 16-18
         in the literature.                   Older age, comorbidities, fever, tachypnea and hypoxia at
         presentation were associated with progression to critical illness. Laboratory abnormalities
         such as lymphopenia, elevated acute phase reactants and coagulation abnormalities were
         also associated with critical illness. Contrary to the findings of Zheng et al., smoking status
                                                                                 19
         was not associated with critical illness development.                       This is probably due to a reporting
         bias, as the 4.2% current smoker rate in our cohort is much lower than the 28.0% daily
                                            20
         smoker rate in Turkey.                 While Petrilli et al. found BMI >40 to be independently associated
                                                                                                                17
         with critical illness development, our findings did not reveal such an association.                       In our
         cohort, BMI was calculated based on self-report of the patients and was missing in 67 (14%)
         participants.
         Multivariable analysis showed that age was independently associated with critical illness, as
                                                  3, 21
         reported by other studies.                     The number of comorbidities was also associated with critical
         illness; each comorbidity increased the HR by 1.33. Liang et al. also found the number of
                                                                                                                              16

         comorbidities as a significant predictor for the development of critical illness.                     We did not
         enter specific comorbidities into the model testing, as comorbidities blend and cancel each
         other out during multivariable analysis. Our model has a high discrimination power with a C-
         index of 0.92.
         The Turkish guidelines for the management of COVID-19 recommend hospitalization for
                                                                                      2
         COVID-19 patients >50 years regardless of comorbidity.                         Our analysis showed that for
         patients <60 years, comorbidity is required for progression to critical illness. This result
         suggests that the lower age limit of hospitalization for patients without comorbidity could be
         raised to 60. Such a change would relieve the demand for hospital beds.
         Patients with PCT ≥0.25 µg/L and LDH ≥350 U/L had HRs of 2.12 and 2.04, respectively, for
         critical illness. PCT increases are expected in bacterial infections, suggesting that these
                                                                              17
         patients might have coexisting bacterial infections.                     The LDH increase is probably due to
         cellular damage induced by the virus as well as the immune response against it. PCT and LDH
                                                                           17, 23, 24                                        3
         associations were also reported in other studies.                            Although lymphopenia (<800/mm )
         and CRP (≥30 mg/dL) remained in the model, they had borderline significance (p=0.05 for
         both). D-dimer (≥1 mg/L) did not remain in the model. As d-dimer levels correlated with CRP
         and PCT, it was omitted from the model at the last step of multivariable analysis.
         The WHO scale for clinical improvement was significantly associated with progression to
         critical illness. Patients with a WHO scale of 4&5 had an HR of 4.15 for critical illness
         compared to those with WHO 2&3. The major difference between the WHO 4&5 and 2&3
         scales is the need for supplemental oxygen. We chose to use the WHO scale in our
                                                                                                                               17

         multivariable model rather than qSOFA because it considers the need for oxygen
         supplementation directly. Additionally, the WHO scale showed a stronger association with
         critical illness than the qSOFA score. To the best of our knowledge, one other study from
         France also found the WHO scale category to be independently associated with the
                                                    25
         development of critical illness.              Due to the limited number of patients, we could not test
         WHO scale categories separately in the multivariable model.
         One factor that strongly remained in the model was the period of admission to the hospital.
         Patients admitted to our hospital at the beginning of May had an HR of 0.14 for progression
         to critical illness compared to patients admitted at the beginning of the pandemic in mid-
         March. Such an association was also reported in New York; patients admitted at the
         beginning of April had an OR of 0.08 for the risk of critical illness compared to patients

         admitted at the beginning of March.                   There could be several explanations for this
         observation. Our hospitalization criteria did not change as the pandemic progressed.
         Hospital care might have become more efficient as experience was gained with time.
         Medication protocols were slightly altered. Venous thromboprophylaxis using LMWH was
         initially administered to patients with classic risk factors for venous thrombosis; however, as
         coagulopathy became apparent in COVID-19 pathogenesis, more patients hospitalized with
         suspected or proven COVID-19 received prophylactic LMWH at the beginning of
                                                               26
         hospitalization unless contraindicated.                  These hypotheses warrant further investigation.
         Additionally, a less virulent form of the virus might have emerged, as there are reports
         showing variants of SARS-CoV-2 with differing infectivity and virulence from March to
                 27, 28
         April.         Furthermore, patients might have been less exposed to the virus due to the
         increased utilization of preventive and control measures as the pandemic advanced.

         Our study has several limitations. Although our hospital is one of the main pandemic
         hospitals within the region, this study is based on a single center’s experience. BMI
         information was lacking in 14.0% of the participants. We did not quantify the extent of
         pulmonary involvement on thoracic CT, which might predict the development of critical
         illness.
         CONCLUSIONS
         Age, comorbidity number, WHO scale, LDH (≥350 U/L) and procalcitonin (≥0.25 µg/L) are
         independently associated with critical illness development in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
         Mortality from COVID-19 seems to be decreasing as the pandemic advances. Our findings
         will be useful in shaping the response for the expected waves of COVID-19.
