    Abstract
    From public health perspectives of COVID-19 pandemic, accurate estimates of infection severity of individuals are
    extremely valuable for the informed decision making and targeted response to an emerging pandemic. This paper
    presents machine learning based prognostic model for providing early warning to the individuals for COVID-19
    infection using the health care data set. In the present work, a prognostic model using Random Forest classifier and
    support vector regression is developed for predicting the Infection Susceptibility Probability (ISP) score of COVID-
    19 and it is applied on an open health care data set containing 27 field values. The typical fields of the health care
    data set include basic personal details such as age, gender, number of children in the household, marital status along
    with medical data like Coma score, Pulmonary score, Blood Glucose level, HDL cholesterol etc. An effective
    preprocessing method is carried out for handling the numerical, categorical values (non-numerical), missing data in
    the health care data set. The correlation between the variables in the health care data is analyzed using the
    correlation coefficient and heat map with a color code is used to identify the influencing factors on the Infection
    Susceptibility Probability (ISP) score of COVID-19. Based on the accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity and F-scores, it is
    noted that the random forest classifier provides an improved classification performance as compared to Support
    vector regression for the given health care data set. Android based mobile application software platform is
    developed using the proposed prognostic approach for enabling the healthy individuals to predict the susceptibility
    infection score of COVID-19 to take the precautionary measures. Based on the results of the proposed method,
    clinicians and government officials can focus on the highly susceptible people for limiting the pandemic spread
    Methods In the present work, Random Forest classifier and support vector regression techniques are applied to a
    medical health care dataset containing 27 variables for predicting the susceptibility score of an individual towards
    COVID-19 infection and the accuracy of prediction is compared. An effective preprocessing is carried for handling
    the missing data in the health care data set. Correlation analysis using heat map is carried on the health care data for
    analyzing the influencing factors of Infection Susceptibility Probability (ISP) score of COVID-19. A confusion
    matrix is calculated for understanding the performance of classification of the based on the number of True-
    Positives, True-Negatives, False-Positives and False-Negatives. These values further used to calculate the accuracy,
    Precision, Sensitivity and F-scores.
    Results From the classification results, it is noted that the Random Forest classifier provides an classification
    accuracy of 99.7% precision of 99.8%, sensitivity of 98.8% and F-score of 99.29% for the given medical data set.
    Conclusion Proposed machine learning approach can help the individuals to take additional precautions for
    protecting people from the COVID-19 infection, clinicians and government officials can focus on the highly
    susceptible people for limiting the pandemic spread.

    Introduction
    The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created a great challenge for the healthcare
    system (Hui etal , 2020). Considering the lethal nature of COVID-19 outbreak and its worldwide spread, World
    Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at different nations have
    provided provisional guidelines for protecting people from getting affected and preventing the further spread of
    COVID-19 virus from infected individuals. RT-PCR tests from deep nasotracheal samples and Chest CT scan are
    commonly used for definitive diagnosis of COVID-19. (Repici A et al. 2020). Due to the quick spread of COVID-
    19, physicians in the health care systems are facing extreme difficulty in the physical examination and analysis of
    subsequent para clinical health care data for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary develop
    software tools for easier way for interpreting the large scale health data set which can help the government and
    healthcare officials for quicker decision making during the Covid-19 pandemic situations.
    With the capability of interpreting the hidden and complex patterns from huge, noisy or complex data, Artificial
    intelligence and machine learning techniques can play a major role in combating the COVID-19 pandemics. Few
    works have been reported by the researchers on use of machine learning techniques for the prediction and diagnosis
    of epidemics (Wynants L et al ,2020). An artificial intelligence based rapid diagnosis approach for COVID-19
    patients developed using the analysis of Chest X ray images (Mei et al, 2020). An artificial intelligence based
    prediction model of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 is proposed by Yang etal, 2020. Linear Regression model is
    used for time series prediction of COVID-19 outbreak (Pandey et al, 2020). Mechanistic models have been reported
    to predict COVID-19 outbreak in real time (Liu etal, 2020). K means algorithm is applied to categorize the countries
    based on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (Carrillo-Larco et al, 2020). XGBoost machine learning model
    is proposed to estimate the survival ratio of severely ill Covid-19 patients (Yan et al. 2020). A classification using
    Fourier and Gabor methods is applied on dataset of COVID-19( Al-Karawi et al 2020). Multi Layered Perception
    (MLP), Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System is used for predicting (Metsky et al. 2020). Support
    vector machine is applied to detect severely ill COVID patients from mild symptom COVID patients (Tang et
    al.2020). Convolutional neural network frameworks have been proposed to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray
    images. (Narin et al, 2020). A prediction model for the propagation analysis of the COVID-19 is proposed by Li etal

    2020. An interpretable mortality prediction model for COVID-19 patients is developed using the health care data set
    ( Lan etal, 2020).
    It is found that many machine learning approaches has been successfully implemented for the prediction and
    diagnostic purposes of COVID-19 using the clinical and health care data. However, prognostic frame works for
    early prediction of COVID-19 infection are found to be limited which can be helpful to take proactive measures to
    combat the virus spread. Random forest and Support vector machine algorithms are found to be popular in achieving
    the satisfactory results for the different prediction applications. Hence, this paper presents Random forest and
    Support vector machine algorithms based prognostic approach for predicting the infection susceptibility score for
    each individual using the health care data. The novelty of the proposed approach is the identification of the infection
    susceptibility prior to infection so that the regulative and preventive rules can be made for the individuals.
    Methods
    Recently, machine learning techniques have applied for prognostic applications like prediction of disease
    symptoms, risks, survivability, and recurrence [Adnan Qayyum et al, 2020]. In the present work, a machine learning
    based prognostic approach is presented for predicting the Infection Susceptibility Probability (ISP) score of COVID-
    19 and categorizing the healthy individuals as low, medium, high using open health care data set. Among the various
    machine learning techniques, random forest and support vector regression has been considered for the present
    application due to their superior classification performance than other techniques such as linear regression, neural
    networks. Proposed prognostic approach is further developed as a strategic decision making tool by involving a
    versatile data base and a mobile application which enables the healthy individuals for taking precautionary measures
    and also government officials in prioritizing the resources in the hospital settings. Fig. 1 shows the major elements of
    the proposed approach and it is described below:

         •    A health care survey data set includes the demographic, epidemiological characteristics, and underlying
              comorbidities of the individuals with the target classes of risk factors namely - High risk (66%-100%),
              Medium risk (33%-66%) and Low risk (0%-33%). As the collected health care data may contain the
              missing values during the data collection, an effective preprocessing is essential and it is carried out before
              it is applied to the machine learning models for the classification applications.

    Data Preprocessing and preparation
    It is noted that the health care survey data is multi modal as it contains many numerical, categorical values (non-
    numerical) and many machine learning algorithms cannot handle data in this form. Also, there can be missing values
    in the relevant fields of the data set which will reduce the accuracy of machine learning algorithms. In order to
    overcome these difficulties, data preprocessing and preparation is essential and it is carried out on the health care
    data set using Label encoding to achieve accurate results using the machine algorithms.
    Data Normalization
    Standardization of the dataset makes a very crucial role in the pipeline of the ML model since if the individual
    features do not reassemble standard normal distribution of data points, the model would become erratic in its
    predictions. This involves a technique of reducing mean value from each individual data point and performing a
    scaling operation to them in order to obtain unit variance per cell of the data.

    Correlation analysis of health care data using Heat map
    With many fields involving demographic, epidemiological characteristics, and underlying comorbidities of the
    individuals, a typical health care data set formulates a high dimensional feature space which has the strong and weak
    relevance to the Infection Susceptibility Probability (ISP) score. As the highly correlated features add noise and
    inaccuracy to the machine learning model, it is necessary to analyze the correlation between the variables in the
    health care data. In this work, correlation analysis of the health care data is carried using the correlation coefficient
    and heat map with a color code is used to visualize it. Based on the statistical analysis of health care data, correlation
    coefficient is calculated as the ratio of covariance and the standard deviation between two feature sets ai and bi is
    given by the following formula:
                    ∑𝑛 𝑖=1(𝑎𝑖 −ā)(𝑏𝑖 −𝑏)
      𝐶=                                                                                                                             (2)

                                  √ ∑𝑛𝑖=1(𝑏𝑖 −𝑏)
    where n is the sample size, ai and bi are the ith data values, and a, b are the mean values. The value of the coefficient
    (C) ranges between −1 and +1. The values of the correlation close to +1 indicate the strong positive correlation,
    those close to −1 show strong negative correlation, and those closest to 0 show no relation.
    Machine learning techniques for predicting the Infection Susceptibility Probability (ISP) score of COVID-19
    Based on the statistical analysis of the health care data with the relevant information on the severity of the covid-19
    infection, binary logistic regression model is fitted to the training sample and the coefficients of the regression
    model are used for calculating the probability of infection (Menelaos Pavlou et al, 2015), (Xinghuan Wang et al,
    2020). In present work, supervised machine learning techniques such as random forest, support vector regression,
    linear regression, and neural networks have been applied for predicting and categorizing the susceptibility score of
    COVID-19 infection using the health care data. With the improved accuracy of classification, random forest and
    support vector regression is considered in the present work and it is explained below:

    Random Forest Classifier
     With interpretable decision logic, Random forest algorithm (RF) is found to be one of the most promising classifier
    which uses multiple decision trees (DT) to train and predict data samples. The general structure of random forest
    with multiple decision trees is shown in Fig.2. The multiple ensemble DTs give rise to different classifications of
    infection susceptibility score. Here the value of n is chosen to be between 10 and 20 for optimum prediction. The
    majority scheme of vote is the terminal deciding factor of the model decision and throws the actual predicted class
    of the ISP of the individual as Low, medium, high.
                                              Fig 2 Illustration of the random forest architecture
    In the random forests classification approach, the ensemble of Decision Trees (DT) is involved in calculating the
    GINI score as in equation (3).
               nij= wjCj- wleft(j)Cleft(j) – wright(j)Cright(j)                                                                     (3)
    Here, the notations of the parameters are so following: nij refers to the significance of the node indexed j, W j is
    indicating the weighted number of samples approaching the node indexed j, Cj indicates the impurity value of node
    indexed j, left(j) denotes the left child node from node indexed j and right(j) shows the right child node from node
    indexed j.
    The second step is to obtain the importance given by each feature of the DT. This significance parameter can be
    computed using equation (4).

    Then we can obtain the final feature of importance as mean of those of all the DTs as given in Fig.2, where RF fi
    refers to the importance of feature indexed i computed through all DTs in the RF and norm fiij refers to the
    normalized feature significance parameter for index i in the DT indexed j and T indicates the total number of DTs.
    Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    In the present work, support vector regression is applied for predicting the susceptibility score of COVID-19
    infection as a continuous variable. Due to very high non linearity in the PCs, a Support Vector Regression based
    approach was chosen to be employed for obtaining probabilities of risk of infection using the medical data set.
    Assuming that the set of training medical data xn is a multivariate set of N observations with observed response
    values yn, a linear function is established as given below:
                               𝑦 = 𝑓(𝑥) =< 𝑤, 𝑥 > +𝑏 = ∑𝑀    𝐽=1  𝑤𝑗 𝑥𝑗 + 𝑏, 𝑦, 𝑏 ∈ 𝑅, 𝑥, 𝑤 ∈ 𝑅 𝑀                             (7)
                                  𝑓(𝑥) = [𝑤 𝑏       ]𝑟 [𝑥 1 ] = 𝑤 𝑟 𝑥 + 𝑏 𝑥, 𝑤 ∈ 𝑅𝑀+1                                          (8)
    In the above equation x is a multidimensional input vector, with bias b and normal vector w. To ensure that it is as
    flat as possible, f(x) with the minimal norm value, a convex optimization problem is formulated to minimize the
    following:
                                                                 1       2
                                                           𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑤 ‖𝑤‖                                                             (9)
                                                                 2
    This shows that the normal vector should be approximated during the process. Magnitude of weights is usually
    interpreted as flatness to the function obtained in the computation.
                                                            𝑓(𝑥, 𝑤) = ∑𝑀  𝑖=1      𝑤𝑖 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 ∈ 𝑅, 𝑤 ∈ 𝑅𝑀                          (10)
    To minimize the loss between the actual and predicted value which is a major constraint SVR adopts epsilon-
    insensitive loss function. Although asymmetrical loss functions should be used to avoid underestimation and
    overestimation, the functions used are usually convex in nature.
    Since most of COVID data is asymmetrical, linear methods wouldn’t provide accurate results. Nonlinear methods in
    Support Vector Regression (SVR) are handled by mapping the features to higher dimensional space called kernels.
               1       2
         𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑤 ‖𝑤 ‖ + 𝐶 ∑𝑁         𝑖=1      𝜀𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖∗                                                                              (11)
               2
    To achieve higher accuracy we replace all instances of x with K (xi,xj) from the earlier linear formula which leads to
    primal formulation shown in the above equation. The transformation of features to kernel space is shown in the
    above equation.
    Prototype Implementation of the Proposed Approach using a Mobile Application
    In order to demonstrate the proposed approach for predicting the Infection Susceptibility Probability (ISP) score of
    COVID-19 of healthy individual, a mobile application software tool with user interface is developed for collecting
    relevant health care data and categorizing the risk of infections as Low, medium and high using random forest
    classifier ML algorithm. Fig. 3 shows the various elements of mobile application involving the central data base,
    interfaces for various stakeholders like health officer, filed workers along with predicted ISP score. The mobile
    application is interfaced with a versatile database to enable the government administrative, health officer to select
    individuals for further quarantine and infection elimination protocol execution. The details of the mobile application
    with the functional modules are given below

    In order to analyze the classification performance of the different machine learning techniques accuracy,
    Precision, Sensitivity and F-scores are calculated using number of True-Positives, True-Negatives, False-
    Positives and False-Negatives of the classification.
    Accuracy: The most common metric for performance assessment measured as a ratio of the number of correctly
    predicted data to the total number of data provided for testing as calculated by Eq.12.
                                                                       𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁

    the total number of instances provided to the model during testing. This is calculated by eq. 13.
                                                                             𝑇𝑃

    Sensitivity: It is measure of ability of the machine learning model to predict the positive labels to all the given
    labels that should have been predicted positive and it is calculated by eq. 14.
                                                                    𝑇𝑃

    F- Score: This is measured by weighted average between precision and recall as calculated by eq15.

    Results
    In the present work, proposed approach is implemented in Python computing and programming environment
    using the major computing libraries and mathematical functions such as Numpy, Pandas, Scikit learn in Jupyter
    Notebook environment involving various machine learning algorithms such as random forest, logistic
    regression, support vector regression, linear regression, and neural networks. An open health care dataset with
    the infection susceptibility probability score available in the online repository Kaggle is used for training,
    validation and testing purposes [Srijan Singh, 2020].The sample health care survey data set is shown in Fig.4. It
    can be seen that the data set contains categorical data and numerical data.

    The hardware specifications of training, testing and inference include a processor of Intel Xeon CPU at
    2.20GHz and a memory of 0.88GB. The given health care data set is preprocessed for overcoming the errors due
    to the missing data. It was found that random forest model was best among the machine learning models for the

    supervised classification of target classes of infection probability and the inference timings for 10000 data was
    found to be 2.85704 seconds.
    Influencing factors of Infection Susceptibility Probability (ISP) score of COVID-19
    As the health care data set contains many fields involving epidemiological characteristics, and underlying
    comorbidities of the individuals, a heat map with a color and magnitude variation is developed to quickly check
    correlations and visualizing the correlation matrix as shown in Fig. 5.
                                                  Fig 5 Heat Map of health care data.
    This heat map shows the correlation coefficient which varies from +1 to -1 for providing an understanding of
    the vital and detrimental correlated factors of health care data on the infection probability. From the correlation
    matrix, four main factors influencing infection probability (ISP) are found to be “No of children”(0.42), “Cases
    per Million”(0.21), “Deaths per Million”(0.24) and “Platelet Count ”(0.12). These results indicate demographic
    fields are critical in influencing the infection susceptibility score of the individual. It can be seen that the gender
    and married fields also have an influence on the results which can be quantitatively analyzed from the
    correlation matrix. Unnecessary fields such as Name, Insurance, Salary, People_ID are found to be non-
    contributing to our analysis and prediction, thus they are removed during data preparation. We can reduce the
    correlation matrix of the dataset in which 4 features have negative correlation with the output label.
    Classification performance of RF classifier
    In the random forest model, the decision trees developed over 100- 200 nodes indicating the complex
    relationships mapped between the dataset and the target classes such as low, medium, high Infection
    Susceptibility Probability (ISP) score of COVID-19 infection. A confusion matrix is calculated for
    understanding the performance of classification of the based on the number of True-Positives, True-Negatives,
    False-Positives and False-Negatives. These values further used to calculate the accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity
    and F-scores. Inferring from the confusion matrix as given in Fig.6, proposed model classifies the different
    groups of people based on their susceptibility with high levels of precision. Here 1 denotes all (100%) the data
    points belonging to Low and High susceptibility were classified correctly and 0.96 denotes that 96% of the data
    points were correctly classified under medium susceptibility along with 0.36 denoting 3.6% being misclassified
    under low susceptibility.

                           Fig 6 Confusion Matrix for random forest model for the health care data
    The performance metrics such as accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity and F-scores are calculated for different
    machine learning models and it is compared with the RF model as shown in Fig.7. It is found that the random
    forest approach has an overall classification accuracy of 99.7% for the validation data set of the health care data
    set. The proposed random forest classifier gives a precision of 99.8%, sensitivity of 98.8% and F-score of
    99.29%.
                              Fig.7 Comparison of performance measure of random forest classifier
    The higher sensitivity of random forest model shows that a high proportion of actual positives are classified
    correctly. Also the higher specificity highlights that a good percentage of the ‘safe’ populations are identified as
    not susceptible to the infection. The precision indicates that there may be some cases of individuals who may
    not have a high susceptibility, but they may be declared as a considerably risky individual.
    Discussions
    In order to quantitatively analyze the proposed RF model, train and test accuracies over different sizes of
    samples, scalability of the model, Performance of the model are presented and the results are analyzed
    Effect of size of the data set
    In order to study the aspects of over fitting of the proposed random forest model, it is applied to different
    number of training and testing data sets. This provides an indication of the over fitting of the model and the
    ability of generalization of classification for the given data set. Fig.8 shows convergence of test and train
    accuracies and it highlights that the model is not over fitting.

    The model can produce highly accurate predictions even with a lower number of training examples as the
    accuracy plot starts at over 99% even for a smaller batch of dataset. This shows the agility of the model to adapt
    to different dataset sizes without over fitting.
    Scalability Curves
    Further, a study has been carried out to understand the scalability of the proposed random forest model, the
    effect of number of training examples of health care data set on the accuracy of classification and training time.
    The results are shown in Fig.8 and Fig.9

              It can be seen that there is a smooth increase in accuracy which highlights the robustness of the model
              with a higher number of training examples. These results indicate that the proposed random forest
              model performs well with high accuracy despite smaller dataset sizes and requires shorter training time
              despite large dataset sizes.
    Regression performance of support vector regression
    Support vector regression is applied to the health care data set for predicting the infection susceptibility
    probability score of COVIG-19. From Fig.11(a), it can be seen that there is a lesser deviation between the
    predicted values and actual values using the RBF kernel function in support vector regression.

    Infection Susceptibility Probability (ISPs). These results highlights the improved prediction of support vector
    regression using RBF kernel as compared to the linear kernel
    Conclusions
    This paper presented a machine learning based prognostic model for the categorical classification of COVID-19
    infection susceptibility as low, medium and high based on the health care data of an individual. A medical data
    set available in the online repository is used for training, testing and validation of the proposed approach. A
    mobile application with user interface is developed for collecting relevant health care data and categorizing the
    risk of infections as Low, medium and high using random forest classifier ML algorithm. Correlation analysis of
    health care data is carried out to study the influencing factors on influencing the Infection Susceptibility
    Probability (ISP) score using the Heat map and correlation. Demographic fields are found to be critical in
    influencing the COVID-19 infection such as “No of children”(0.42), “Cases per Million”(0.21), “Deaths per
    Million”(0.24) and “Platelet Count ”(0.12). Based on the comparative study of performance measures for the
    classification of infection score, it is found that the random forest classifier has the better overall classification
    accuracy of 99.7% precision of 99.8%, sensitivity of 98.8% and F-score of 99.29% as compared to the other
    machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector regression, neural network. Studies on
    proposed random forest model for different number of data sets highlights robustness and scalability of the
    proposed approach and it highlights the high accuracy despite smaller dataset sizes and a shorter training time
    despite large dataset sizes. It is found that support vector regression using RBF kernel function is found to be
    superior to the linear kernel function in prediction of infection susceptibility of individual for COVID-19.
    These results highlighted the application of machine learning approaches for analyzing the health care data in
    understanding the infection severity of individual for COVID-19. From the larger public health care perspective,
    proposed approach will be helpful in identification of individuals who are highly susceptible for the COVID-19
    infection in a containment zone which can give a decisive role to physicians and government officials for
    planning the more aggressive treatment and a better chance of survival. Also the early detection can also help
    hospitals prioritize intensive-care resources.
