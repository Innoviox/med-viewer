    Background
    Data on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients disaggregated by race/ethnicity remain limited.
    We evaluated the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients across the major
    racial/ethnic groups and assessed their associations with COVID-19 outcomes.

    Methods
    This retrospective cohort study analyzed patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in a large,
    integrated health system spanning California, Oregon, and Washington between March 1 and
    August 30, 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from electronic
    health records. Odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and in-hospital death
    were assessed with multivariate logistic regression.

    Findings
    289,294 patients with known race/ethnicity were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, of whom
    27.5% were non-White minorities. 15,605 persons tested positive, with minorities representing
    58.0%. Disparities were widest among Hispanics, who represented 40.5% of infections but
    12.8% of those tested. Hispanics were generally younger and had fewer comorbidities except
    diabetes than White patients. Of the 3,197 patients hospitalized, 58.9% were non-White. 459
    patients died, of whom 49.8% were minorities. Racial/ethnic distributions of outcomes across
    the health system tracked with state-level statistics. Increase odds of testing positive and
    hospitalization were associated with all minority races/ethnicities except American Indian/Alaska
    Native. Highest odds of testing SARS-CoV-2 positive was for Hispanic patients (OR [95% CI]:
    3.68 [3.52-3.84]) and highest odds of COVID-19 hospitalization was for Native Hawaiian/Pacific
    Islander patients (2.13 [1.48 - 3.06]). Hispanic patients also exhibited increased morbidity
    including need for mechanical ventilation. In multivariate modeling, Hispanic race/ethnicity was
    associated with increased odds of hospital mortality (1.75 [1.15-2.67]) among patients over age
    70, but hospital mortality was not increased for any race/ethnicity sub-population in the
    multivariate model.

    Interpretation
    Major healthcare disparities were evident, especially among Hispanics who tested positive at a
    higher rate, and despite younger in age, required excess hospitalization and need for
    mechanical ventilation compared to their expected demographic proportions. As characteristics
    of patients varying between race/ethnicity, targeted, culturally-responsive interventions are
    needed to address the increased risk of poor outcomes among minority populations with
    COVID-19.

    Introduction
    Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Washington state, the
    United States has documented the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths in the world.
    Increasing evidence have indicated that COVID-19 disproportionately affects patients of minority
    race and ethnicity(1–3). While reports have identified different rates of infection, hospitalization,
    and mortality among minority populations, there is limited information on the characteristics of
    COVID-19 patients disaggregated by race/ethnicity.(4,5)

    The prevalence of comorbidities and social environments vary between racial/ethnic
    groups(6,7). Some of these characteristics, such as obesity and crowded housing, are potential
    risk factors for COVID-19 and disease severity(8,9). Understanding how the characteristics of
    patients differ between races/ethnicities and which factors are associated with disease
    outcomes are therefore critical for public health and designing community-based interventions.
    Unfortunately, such detailed characteristics remain sparse and certain racial/ethnic groups,
    specifically Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NH/PI), and American
    Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) remain yet to be characterized in detail(10,11).
    Furthermore, while sociodemographic and health characteristics vary across geography, multi-
    state comparisons are limited. The objective of this study therefore is to examine the
    characteristics of and factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization with
    COVID-19, and in-hospital mortality in a large diverse population of patients in a large health
    system operating in California, Oregon, and Washington.

    Method
    Study Design, Setting, and Population
    This retrospective cohort study included patients from California, Oregon, and Washington who
    were tested for SARS-CoV-2 with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of a
    nasopharyngeal sample and were seen at a Providence St. Joseph Heath (PSJH) facility
    between March 1, 2020 and August 30, 2020. In-hospital outcomes were monitored through
    October 4, 2020. PSJH is one of the largest health care system in the US. In 2019,
    approximately 3.5 million patients in California, Oregon, and Washington received care at the
    facilities included in this study, of whom 70.2% identified as non-Hispanic White; 12.4% as
    Hispanic; 7.7% as non-Hispanic Asian American; 4.0% as non-Hispanic Black; 0.7% non-
    Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native; 0.6% non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander;
    and 4.4% non-Hispanic Other. The protocol for this study was reviewed and approved by the
    PSJH Institutional Review Board (IRB #: STUDY2020000203).

    Data Collection
    Patient demographic and clinical data were extracted from PSJH’s Epic electronic health record
    system and stored in PSJH’s cloud relational database management system. Patients with a
    positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 were considered to have a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
    For patients who had multiple tests, only the initial positive test result was considered. Extracted
    demographic data included age, sex, reported race and ethnicity, and insurance plan. 64
    patients with missing values for sex were excluded from the study. Missing race and ethnicity
    were grouped as Unknown. ZIP codes were used to identify the neighborhood-level rates of

    poverty, percentage of crowded housing (>1 person per room), percentage of minority
    population (race/ethnicity except non-Hispanic white), and percentage of limited English
    proficient population from the US Census Bureau’s 2018 American Community Survey, 5-year
    estimates. Clinical data include underlying medical conditions identified using International
    Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes or direct
    clinical measurements linked to past encounters between January 1, 2019 and the date of
    COVID-19 testing. We included underlying medical conditions that have previously been
    associated with COVID-19(12,13). Specifically, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used to
    capture the risk from multiple comorbidities while obesity and hypertension, which are not
    components of CCI, were included as independent variables. For components of the Charlson
    Comorbidity Index, we used diagnosis codes as previously defined(14). Hypertension was
    defined as I10. Obesity was defined based on Center for Disease Control definitions using BMI
    measurements. Inpatient encounter data included presenting vital signs, baseline laboratories or
    procedures, supplemental oxygen use, acute diagnoses (COVID-19: U07.1; lower respiratory
    infection: J22; acute respiratory distress syndrome: J80; respiratory failure: J96; pneumonia:
    J12.89), length of stay, transfer to intensive care unit, and discharge disposition.

    For comparison with state-level data, COVID-19 case and death for California, Oregon, and
    Washington was obtained from the COVID Racial Data Tracker, which aggregates historical
    COVID-19 case and death data from state public health agencies(15). Data on COVID-19-
    related hospitalization for California and Oregon was obtained from the Center for Disease
    Control’s Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance
    Network (COVID-NET) while Washington data was obtained from the University of Minnesota
    COVID-19 Hospitalization Tracking Project(16,17).

    Statistical Analysis
    We first compared the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients across COVID-
    19 outcomes and across race/ethnicity categories, defined as Hispanic; non-Hispanic Black
    (Black); non-Hispanic Asian American (Asian); non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian and Pacific
    Islander (NH/PI); non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN); non-Hispanic white
    (White); and non-Hispanic other (Other), which includes multi-race/ethnicity. For patients
    hospitalized with COVID-19, presenting clinical characteristics were available and were defined
    as clinical status according to the World Health Organization’s 9-point Ordinal Scale(18) and
    presenting vitals within the first 6 hours of admissions and baseline laboratory test results within
    24 hours of admissions.

    Associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and hospital mortality was assessed
    with mixed-effect logistic regression models. For each outcome, we first calculated an
    unadjusted univariate model and an adjusted multivariate model. State and county were
    included as nested random effects to account for geographical variations in each unadjusted
    and adjusted model. All multivariate models included race/ethnicity as an independent variable,
    with demographic factors (age; age-squared; sex), socioeconomic factors (insurance;
    neighborhood rates of poverty, crowded housing, limited English proficiency, and minority), and
    comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index score; hypertension; and obesity) as covariates. In

    addition to age, an age-squared term was included in the model to capture the previously
    observed non-linear relationship between COVID-19 outcomes and age(19). For analyses of
    hospital mortality, additional covariates included WHO Ordinal Scale score and baseline lab
    results, both at admissions. Covariates were selected based on previously identified risk factors,
    as well as patterns of missingness and collinearity. Certain characteristics, specifically BMI,
    insurance coverage, and baseline lab results, were not available for all patients. For clinical
    labs, B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, ferritin, neutrophil count, procalcitonin and
    venous lactate, while previously associated with COVID-19 outcomes, were not consistently
    measured or reported at baseline (≥20% missingness). We therefore excluded them from
    regression analyses. Alanine transaminase was excluded due to high correlation with aspartate
    transaminase and had more missing values. For variables with less than 20% missingness,
    missing values were imputed with multiple imputation by fully conditional specification (15
    imputations).

    To account for changes in public health guidance and the effect of reopening, we also
    compared the time period earlier in the pandemic (“Initial” period) between March 1, 2020 and
    June 15, 2020 with the period after June 15, 2020 (“Resurgence” period) when California,
    Oregon, and Washington began reopening.(20–22)

    Results
    Characteristics of Patients Tested for SARS-CoV-2
    A total of 323,419 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 were included. 289,288 patients (89.4%)
    reported race/ethnicity, of which 72.5% were White, 12.8% were Hispanic, 5.3% were Asian,
    4.0% Black, 0.9% were AI/AN, 0.7% were NH/PI, and 3.8% were Other (Table 1). The mean
    age (SD) among all tested patients was 52.1 (19.4) and 57.4% were female. The majority of
    patients (52.9%) had public insurance (Medicaid: 29.1%; Medicare: 23.8%), with higher
    percentages of Hispanic, Black, NH/PI, and AI/AN patients on Medicaid than White and Asian
    patients (Table S1). The most common comorbidities were obesity (37.0%), hypertension
    (24.4%), diabetes (10.1%) and asthma (7.0 %). The median score on the Charlson Comorbidity
    Index was 1.0 (95% CI: 0.0-3.0), corresponding to a 95.9% estimated 10-year survival.

    Characteristics of Patients Positive for SARS-CoV-2 Infection
    17,831 patients (5.5%) of the 323,419 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. Among
    the 15,609 patients with known race/ethnicity, the rate of positive test results was higher in
    patients of minority race/ethnicity compared to White patients (3.1%; Table S1), with Hispanic
    and NH/PI patients having the highest rate (17.0% and 11.4%, respectively). Consequently,
    White and Hispanic patients make up similar percentages of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients
    (42.0% and 40.5%, respectively), followed by Other (5.3%), Asian (5.1%), Black (5.0%), NH/PI
    (1.4%), and AI/AN (0.6%) patients (Table 1).

    Among all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, the mean age (SD) was 48.1 (19.6) and 52.1% were
    female (Table 1). Compared to White patients, mean ages were lower among patients of
    minority race/ethnicity, except for Asians, which had a similar mean age (Table 2). Scores on
    the Charlson Cormorbidity Index was also lower among minority patients. The prevalence of

    diabetes, however, was higher among minority patients, particularly among Asian, Black, NH/PI
    and AI/AN patients. Additionally, relative to White patients, Hispanic patients had higher
    prevalence of obesity; Asian patients had higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes;
    Black patients had higher prevalence of both asthma and hypertension; and NH/PI and AI/NH
    patients had greater proportions of obesity and kidney disease.

    Hispanic, Black, NH/PI, and AI/NH patients were more likely to have Medicaid insurance than
    White and Asian patients (Table 2). All minority patients were more likely than White patients to
    reside in neighborhoods with higher percentages of poverty, crowded housing, and minorities.
    Hispanic, Asian, and Black patients in particular were also more likely to live in neighborhoods
    with a higher percentage of limited English proficient population. All minority patients were more
    likely to have received their tests in the emergency department than White patients.

    Characteristics of Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19
    18.6% (n=3,321) of the patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were hospitalized. 3,200
    patients (96.4%) had known race/ethnicity, of which 41.2% were White, 39.8% were Hispanic,
    6.1% were Asian, 5.1% were Black, 1.6% were NH/PI, 0.8% were AI/AN, and 5.4% were Other
    (Table 1). The mean (SD) age of all patients was 63.7 (18.1) and 55.6% were male. The
    median Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 3.0 (1.0-6.0) and the most common
    comorbidities were obesity (40.7%), hypertension (37.9%), and diabetes (27.3%). At admission,
    26.2% of patients were febrile (≥38ºC), 30.9% had a respiration rate >24 breaths/min, and
    33.0% received supplemental oxygen.

    White patients had the highest mean age (71.0±16.8; Table 3) and median Charlson
    Comorbidity Index score (5.0 [3.0-7.0]). NI/PI patients had the lowest mean age (52.9±17.2) and
    NH/PI and Hispanic patients had the lowest mean Charlson Comorbidity Index score (2.0 [1.0-
    4.0]).) at presentation. The prevalence of obesity was highest among AI/AN, NH/PI, and
    Hispanic patients and lowest among Asian patients. However, Hispanics had the lowest
    prevalence of hypertension while Asian patients had the highest. The majority of Hispanic,
    Black, and AI/AN patients were on Medicaid; and Hispanic, Black and Asian patients resided in
    neighborhoods with higher percentages of crowded housing, minorities, and limited English
    speakers than other racial/ethnic subgroups. On admission, a higher percentage of Hispanic
    patients (10.5%) than White patients (6.1%) had a score of five or above on the WHO Ordinal
    Scale, and a higher percentage of Hispanic patients than White patients were febrile, had low
    oxygen saturation, and had high respiration rates. Over the course of hospitalization, a higher
    percentage of Hispanic patients (21.0%) than White patients (12.6%) needed mechanical
    ventilation.

    Overall, the unadjusted hospital mortality rate was 14.2% (472/3,321 hospitalized patients). 252
    of the 472 deceased patients (53.4%) needed mechanical ventilation.

    Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients Over Time
    Between the initial and resurgence phase (Methods), the percentage of positive tests increased
    (5.3% vs. 5.7%), but both the rate of hospitalization among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients

    (24.3% vs. 15.3%) and the in-hospital mortality rate (17.2% vs. 11.3%) decreased. Over the
    course of the pandemic, the proportion of Hispanic patients receiving a test for SARS-CoV-2,
    testing positive, or were hospitalized with COVID-19 increased while the proportions of patients
    of another race/ethnicity decreased or remained similar (Figure S1). Rates of positive test and
    hospitalization per 100,000 patients were on average higher among minorities than White
    patients, with Hispanics and NH/PI patients having the highest rates. In particular, Hispanic
    consistently had higher rates than White patients throughout the pandemic with rates peaking
    during the resurgence phase. Between these two periods, the mean age of patients decreased
    (P < 0.001 for all outcomes).

    Comparison with State-level SARS-CoV-2 Cases, COVID-19 Hospitalization, and Death
    The distribution of race/ethnicity among patients in this study generally reflected state-level
    distributions for COVID-19 outcomes (Figure S2-4). In particular, high proportions of Hispanics
    were consistently observed both in the state-wide data as well as data within the PSJH system.
    While the proportions of White patients testing positive and hospitalized was slightly higher in
    this PSJH population, the differences in racial/ethnic distributions between the PSJH population
    and the overall census population were consistent or smaller than the differences observed at
    the state-level (Figure S5-6).

    Factors Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection
    Minority populations including Hispanic, Black, Asian, NH/PI and AI/AN had increased odds of
    SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to Whites in unadjusted and adjusted analysis (Table 4). In
    adjusted multivariate analysis, increased odds of positive SARS-CoV-2 results were
    independently associated with Hispanic (OR [95% CI]: 3.68 [3.52-3.84]), NH/PI (3.42 [2.95-
    3.96]), Black (1.78 [1.64-1.93]), Asian (1.58 [1.47 - 1.71]), and Other (2.01 [1.86 - 2.17])
    race/ethnicity with White patients as the reference category. Increasing age and age-squared,
    male sex, overweight, obesity (all categories), Medicaid insurance, lack of insurance, and
    residence in a neighborhood with higher percentage of minorities and limited English proficient
    individuals were also independently associated with increased odds of infection. Higher
    Charlson Comorbidity Index score and Medicare insurance, however, were associated with
    lower odds of positive SARS-CoV-2 infection. Odds of infection were higher (1.05 [1.01-1.08]) in
    the resurgence period after June 15, 2020 than the initial period.

    Factors Associated with Hospitalization for COVID-19
    Minority races/ethnicities were not consistently associated with increased odds for COVID-19
    hospitalization, until adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, insurance status and
    neighborhood characteristics. (Table 4). In multivariate analysis, the odds ratio for COVID-19
    hospitalization was highest among NH/PI (2.13 [1.48 - 3.06]), followed by Asian (1.50 [1.22 -
    1.85]), Hispanic (1.49 [1.32 - 1.69]), AI/AN (1.42 [0.84 - 2.40]), Black (1.29 [1.04 - 1.60]), and
    Other (1.29 [1.05-1.58]) patients. Increasing age, male sex, public insurance, higher Charlson
    Comorbidity Index score, being underweight, having class 2 or 3 obesity, having hypertension,
    and residence in a neighborhood with higher rates of poverty were also independently
    associated with increased odds of hospitalization. Odds of hospitalization were significantly
    lower during the resurgence period (0.81 [0.74-0.88]).

    Factors Associated with Hospital Mortality in Admissions for COVID-19
    Race/ethnicity was not significantly associated with hospital mortality in adjusted analyses of all
    3,321 hospitalized patients (Table 5). However, Hispanic patients were generally younger than
    White patients. Hospital mortality rates were higher for Hispanic patients over age 70 than White
    patients (Figure S7). Correspondingly, Hispanic race/ethnicity was significantly associated with
    higher odds of mortality (1.75 [1.15-2.67]) in adjusted multivariate analysis of patients over age
    70 (Table 5). Associations with race/ethnicity were not clearly observed among patients under
    age 70 in multivariate analysis that also controlled for age and age-squared. In an adjusted
    interaction analysis of race/ethnicity and age, increased odds of mortality were identified among
    Hispanic patients as age increased (1.55 [1.06 - 2.27]; Pinteraction=0.022; Table S2, Figure S6B).

    Hospital mortality was also independently associated with the sociodemographic factors of age
    and male sex; the clinical feature of higher score on the WHO Ordinal Scale on admission and
    Charlson Comorbidity Index score; and the baseline clinical lab results of high white blood cell
    count, low lymphocyte, low platelet count, high AST, and high blood urea nitrogen. Odds of
    mortality was lower during the resurgence period.

    Discussion
    This study examined the characteristics and clinical outcomes of 323,419 patients tested for
    SARS-CoV-2 across California, Oregon, and Washington. Overall, we highlight how
    characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients vary by race/ethnicity and show differential
    associations of COVID-19 hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality within race/ethnic
    populations. While patients of minority race/ethnicity represented 27.5% of patients tested for
    SARS-CoV-2, they constituted 58.0% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and 58.8% of
    hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Hispanic patients in particular represented 40.5% and 39.8% of
    SARS-CoV-2 infected and hospitalized COVID-19 patients, respectively, despite making up only
    12.8% of tested patients, a pattern consistent with state-level data. Time-series data document
    a shift over the course of the pandemic to younger and more Hispanic populations.
    Race/ethnicity was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization, with
    adjusted odds of both outcomes highest among Hispanics and NH/PI patients. Older Hispanic
    patients had significantly increased odds of hospital mortality. These findings highlight the
    disproportionate burden of COVID-19 born by Hispanics in these western US states, despite
    younger age and in general fewer comorbidities when compared to White with SARS-CoV-2
    infection or COVID-19 hospitalization.

    Understanding racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 cases and outcomes is important for
    understanding the nature of the disease and guiding public health prevention efforts and
    medical interventions. This study comprehensively detailed and compared the clinical and
    epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 across all major races/ethnicities, highlighting in
    particular Asian, NH/PI, and AI/AN patients who have been underrepresented in COVID-19
    literature to date. In doing so, we show that these populations, particularly NH/PI patients, have
    similar or higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization as Black and Hispanic
    patients, demonstrating the need to focus resources on all minority racial/ethnic populations

    including public health messaging, recruitment to proportional representation in clinical trials(23)
    and possibly in efforts by health systems to actively intervene earlier in the disease course.

    The significant associations of minority races/ethnicities with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-
    19-related hospitalization builds on previous analyses of Black and Hispanic patients(24–27).
    However, unlike previous studies, we found a significant association between Hispanic
    race/ethnicity and hospital mortality among older patients. Since minority patients were
    generally younger than White patients in this study and previous studies, our findings suggest
    that the relationship between race/ethnicity and hospital mortality is moderated by age. The
    clinical characteristics of Hispanic patients at hospital admission also suggest that they are
    presenting with more severe illness than White patients. In particular, a higher percentage of
    Hispanic patients presented with WHO Ordinal Scale scores of five or higher, reflecting a need
    for high-flow supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Hispanic patients are also more
    likely to be febrile, have low oxygen saturation, and high respiration rates. These clinical
    findings suggest a delay in seeking care among Hispanic patients. While this study cannot
    identify the causes behind the observed associations, certain social, structural or biologic
    determinants of health have been suggested(3). Social and structural determinates could
    include occupation risk and limited access to healthcare and testing(3). These characteristics
    may thus be the result of delay of care or lack of early diagnosis. Further studies are needed to
    identify the causal factors driving the disparities in COVID-19.

    This study also confirms and expands on sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with
    COVID-19 severity, including increased age; male sex; multimorbidity; obesity; dyspnea; and
    biomarkers of cardiovascular, immune, and renal function(28–30). In particular, we demonstrate
    how these associated characteristics vary across race/ethnicity. For example, Asian patients,
    when compared to other minority patients, have a higher mean age, lower percentage of
    obesity, and were less likely to be on Medicaid. These differences suggest varying levels of risk
    across race/ethnicity and demonstrates the need for further disaggregation of data on racial and
    ethnic differences in COVID-19 and targeted community intervention at the local level.

    While the large size of this study’s diverse cohort and its wide geographical distribution are
    strengths of this study, there are limitations. This study was limited to a subset of catchment
    areas within California, Oregon, and Washington with patients under care in a single large,
    integrated health system. Thus, the results may therefore be less generalizable to other regions
    of the US or other areas within these states. At the same time, structured electronic health
    record data is subject to the quality, consistency, and completeness of data entry by the care
    team. In particular, our use of ICD-10-CM code for identifying comorbidities may not capture
    diagnoses that are not billable or represented by a given code. Some patients may have also
    received care at other institutions and therefore certain outcomes or characteristics may be
    underreported. Furthermore, public health guidance and regulations have rapidly changed
    within and across states over the course of the pandemic. While we controlled for geographical
    variations and time-periods, we may still not have fully accounted for the effect of policy
    changes or increasing availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity. Despite these limitations,

    however, our results highlight how the impact of COVID-19 vary across race/ethnicity in a large
    geographical area.
