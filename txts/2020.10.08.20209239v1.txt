    Abstract
    Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of vaginal dinoprostone versus placebo in pain
    relief during intrauterine device (IUD) insertion.
    Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials.
    Setting: Not applicable.
    Patient(s): Women undergoing IUD insertion and receiving vaginal dinoprostone or placebo.
    Intervention(s): PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were screened from
    inception to 01-October-2020, using the following search strategy: (dinoprostone OR cervidil
    OR prepidil) AND (intrauterine device OR iud).
    Main outcome measure(s): IUD insertion related pain, patient satisfaction, provider ease of IUD
    insertion, and side effects.
    Result(s): Five studies met the study inclusion criteria, comprising 862 patients; equally 431
    patients received vaginal dinoprostone and placebo. All studies had an overall low risk of bias.
    When compared to placebo, dinoprostone significantly correlated with decreased pain at
    tenaculum placement (SMD=-0.79, 95% CI [-1.43, -0.16], p=0.01), decreased pain at uterine
    sounding (SMD=-0.88, 95% CI [-1.54, -0.22], p=0.009), decreased pain at IUD insertion (SMD=-
    1.18, 95% CI [-1.74, -0.61], p<0.001), decreased need for additional analgesia (RR=0.34, 95% CI
    [0.22, 0.53], p<0.001), increased patient satisfaction (SMD=1.41, 95% CI [0.62, 2.20], p<0.001),
    and increased provider ease of IUD insertion (SMD=-1.17, 95% CI [-1.62, -0.73], p<0.001). Fever
    was statistically significantly higher in dinoprostone versus placebo group (RR=3.73, 95% CI
    [1.47, 9.44], p=0.006). All other side effects—including nausea, vomiting, shivering, diarrhea,

    abdominal cramps, vasovagal attack, uterine perforation, and postprocedural bleeding—did not
    substantially differ between both groups.
    Conclusions: This first ever meta-analysis advocates that dinoprostone is safe, effective, and
    yields favorable analgesic outcomes during IUD insertion.

    Introduction
    Intrauterine devices (IUDs) deliver a largely effective, harmless, and long-lasting method of
    reversible contraception with an analogous efficacy to tubal sterilization (1, 2). The use of IUDs
    is highly endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (3) and American
    Academy of Pediatrics (4) to avoid unplanned pregnancies among sexually active adolescents
    and young women. Globally, the two most frequently utilized IUDs comprise the levonorgestrel-
    releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and copper-containing intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) (1,
    2), both of which are equally used in nulliparous and multiparous women (5).
          There are a few downsides associated with IUD use. Importantly, pain perception is one of
    the substantial factors contributing to restricted utility of IUDs, particularly among nulliparous
    women who possess relatively narrower uterine cavities when compared to their multiparous
    counterparts (6, 7). This remark is in line with the perspective that a large proportion of
    healthcare personnel restrict IUD administration to nulliparous women owing to worries
    pertaining to anticipated insertion pain and procedural difficulties (8-10). Indeed, each step of
    IUD insertion procedure can instigate a large deal of pain perception (11). Therefore, proper
    control of pain before, during, and after IUD insertion is critically important to favorably
    maximize the IUD usage frequency and minimize the rate of unplanned pregnancies among
    sexually active adolescents and young women.
          The optimal method of pain relief during IUD insertion remains undefined (12, 13). A
    contemporary systematic review and network meta-analysis of numerous lines of
    pharmacologic analgesic interventions—including placebo, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
    drugs, nitric oxide donors, lavender scent, lidocaine, and misoprostol—demonstrated no

                                                                                                                         Page 6 of 26
    tangible effectiveness for IUD insertion-related pain (14). Conversely, lidocaine-prilocaine
    cream (genital mucosal application) was the most effective intervention for IUD insertion-
    related pain (14). However, when lidocaine-prilocaine was compared head-to-head with other
    pharmacologic interventions, including placebo, it did not exhibit significantly reduced pain 5-
    20 minutes after IUD insertion (14). More research is warranted for alternative analgesics to
    control pain during IUD insertion procedure.
       Dinoprostone is a naturally occurring prostaglandin E2 equivalent (15). It is frequently
    employed in obstetrics for labor induction, which is mediated through cervical ripening and
    prompting of uterine contractions with an equivalent labor-inducing efficacy to misoprostol but
    substantially less adverse events (16). Additionally, dinoprostone has been exploited
    successfully prior to diagnostic hysteroscopy to ease the procedure and reduce associated pain
    without considerable toxicity when compared to placebo or misoprostol (17, 18). Only a very
    limited number of trials examined the safety and efficacy of vaginal dinoprostone versus
    placebo in facilitating IUD insertion and decreasing its related pain (12, 18-21). To date, no
    meta-analysis has been conducted to amass the data and inform concrete conclusions.
    Therefore, the aim of this study is to systematically and meta-analytically synthesize evidence
    from randomized controlled trials that scrutinized the safety and efficacy of vaginal
    dinoprostone versus placebo for pain relief among women undergoing IUD insertion.
    Methods
    This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in harmony with the Preferred
    Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (22).

    Literature search strategy
    Four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) were screened from
    inception to October 1st, 2020. The following search strategy was used for all databases:
    (dinoprostone OR cervidil OR prepidil) AND (intrauterine device OR iud). There was no language
    restriction.
    Inclusion and exclusion criteria
    We included all articles that met the following criteria for our PICOS evidence-based research
    question: (I) Patients: women who received LNG-IUS or Cu-IUD for contraception, (II)
    Intervention: vaginal dinoprostone, (III) Comparator: vaginal placebo, (IV) Outcomes: efficacy
    and safety endpoints, and (V) Study design: randomized controlled trials. We excluded drugs
    other than dinoprostone, indications other than contraception, non-randomized study designs,
    non-human trials, abstracts, and articles without full texts.
    Screening of Results
    The retrieved citations were exported using EndNote software and duplicates were crossed out.
    The screening of results was completed through a two-fold phase. The first phase involved title
    and abstract screening of all citations. The second phase involved retrieval of the full text of all
    potential citations. Moreover, the reference lists of the included studies were reviewed
    manually for potential inclusion of other relevant studies. Two authors screened the citations
    independently and disagreements were resolved by a consensus among the two authors.

    Risk of bias assessment of the included studies
    We utilized the Cochrane’s risk of bias tool in evaluating the quality of the included studies (23).
    This tool is elaborated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions,
    Version 5.1.0, Chapter 8. This tool appraises the following domains: random sequence
    generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome
    assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other potential
    sources of bias. Two authors evaluated the risk of bias independently and disagreements were
    resolved by a consensus among the two authors.
    Data Extraction
    We extracted three types of data: (I) baseline characteristics of the included studies, (II) efficacy
    outcomes, and (III) safety outcomes. Data about baseline characteristics of the included studies
    comprised author’s first name, year of publication, national clinical trial identifier, country, type
    of IUD device, study group, sample size, timing of drug administration before IUD procedure,
    and the person administering the drug. Moreover, patients’ age, body mass index, parity,
    gravidity, position of uterus, history of previous abortion, and history of previous IUD were
    extracted. Data about efficacy outcomes included pain at tenaculum placement, pain at uterine
    sounding, pain at IUD insertion, pain after IUD insertion (10-30 mins), need for additional
    analgesia after procedure, duration of procedure, ease of IUD insertion as reported by
    healthcare providers, and procedural satisfaction as reported by patients. Pain scores were
    evaluated according to the 10-cm/100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) in which “0”

                                                                                                                         Page 9 of 26
    corresponded to no pain at all and “10 cm/100 mm” corresponded to the worst possible pain
    imaginable. Likewise, ease of IUD insertion as reported by healthcare providers was scored
    according to a 10-cm/100-mm VAS-like metric in which “0” corresponded to easy insertion and
    “10 cm/100 mm” corresponded to extremely difficult insertion. Equally, procedural satisfaction
    as reported by patients was scored according to a 10-cm/100-mm VAS-like metric in which “0”
    corresponded to no satisfaction and “10 cm/100 mm” corresponded to maximum satisfaction.
    Data about safety outcomes included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, shivering, fever, abdominal
    cramps, postprocedural bleeding, vasovagal attack, and uterine perforation. Four authors
    participated in data extraction and verification.
    Data analysis
    Review Manager Software version 5.4 was used for meta-analysis. Continuous data were
    analyzed using the inverse variance method and reported as weighted mean difference (WMD)
    or standardized mean difference (SMD), as appropriate, with 95% confidence interval (95% CI).
    Dichotomous data were analyzed using the Mantel–Haenszel method and reported as risk ratio
    (RR) with 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was established if chi-square was p<0.1 and I-square
    test (I ) was >50% (24). Fixed- and random-effects models were used for meta-analysis of
            2
    homogenous and heterogeneous data, respectively. Publication bias was not evaluated since
    the number of included studies (n=5) was lower than the minimum required (n=10) (27).

    Literature search generated a total of 67 studies after omission of duplicated ones. After title
    and abstract screening, 50 studies were excluded and the remaining 17 studies progressed to
    full text screening for eligibility. Finally, a total of five (n=5) studies met the inclusion criteria
    and were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis (12, 13, 19-21). Supplemental
    Figure 1 displays the PRIMSA flowchart. This meta-analysis included 862 patients; equally 431
    patients received vaginal dinoprostone and placebo. All studies originated in Egypt. Three
    studies included nulliparous women, whereas one study included only patients who delivered
    by cesarean section. Furthermore, three studies included patients receiving Cu-IUD as the
    method of contraception. The dose of vaginal dinoprostone was consistent (3 mg) in all studies,
    however, the duration of drug application differed between studies, ranging from 2 to 12 hours
    before procedure. Drugs were administered by nurses in three studies and self-administered in
    two studies. The baseline characteristics of the included studies are displayed in Supplemental
    Table 1.
    Risk of bias assessment of the included studies
    Overall, the included studies showed an overall low risk of bias. In two studies, the drugs
    (vaginal dinoprostone and placebo) were self-administered by patients. Although measures had
    been taken by investigators to remind patients about the time to vaginally self-administer the
    drugs three (19) and 12 (13) hours before the procedure, however, this cannot be certainly
    established, and we judged the other bias domain as high risk. The graph and summary of risk
    of bias are depicted in Supplemental Figure 2.

    Efficacy outcome: Pain at tenaculum insertion
    Three studies were meta-analyzed (12, 13, 19). The overall effect estimate revealed significantly
    reduced pain at tenaculum insertion in the dinoprostone versus placebo group (SMD=-0.79,
    95% CI [-1.43, -0.16], p=0.01). Pooled analysis was heterogeneous (I =88%, p=0.0002) (Figure      2
    1A).
    Efficacy outcome: Pain at uterine sounding
    Three studies were meta-analyzed (12, 13, 19). The overall effect estimate revealed significantly
    reduced pain at uterine sounding in the dinoprostone versus placebo group (SMD=-0.88, 95% CI
    [-1.54, -0.22], p=0.009). Pooled analysis was heterogeneous (I =89%, p<0.001) (Figure 1B).

    Efficacy outcome: Pain at IUD insertion
    Five studies were meta-analyzed (12, 13, 19-21). The overall effect estimate revealed
    significantly reduced pain at IUD insertion in the dinoprostone versus placebo group (SMD=-
    1.18, 95% CI [-1.74, -0.61], p<0.001). Pooled analysis was heterogeneous (I =92%, p<0.001)                   2
    (Figure 1C).
    Efficacy outcome: Pain after IUD insertion (10-30 mins)
    Four studies were meta-analyzed (12, 13, 19, 21). The overall effect estimate did not exhibit
    statistically significant difference between both groups with regard to pain after IUD insertion
    (SMD=-0.57 [-1.19, 0.05], p=0.07). Pooled analysis was heterogeneous (I =92%, p<0.001) (Figure      2
    1D).

    Efficacy outcome: Need for additional analgesia
    Four studies were meta-analyzed (12, 13, 19, 21). The overall effect estimate revealed
    significantly reduced need for additional analgesia in the dinoprostone versus placebo group
    (RR= 0.34, 95% CI [0.22, 0.53], p<0.001). Pooled analysis was homogenous (I =0%, p=0.88)                        2
    (Figure 2).
    Efficacy outcome: Duration of IUD insertion procedure
    Five studies were meta-analyzed (12, 13, 19-21). The overall effect estimate did not exhibit
    statistically significant difference between both groups (MD= - 0.49 [-1.15, 0.18], p=0.15).

    Discussion
    This systematic review and meta-analysis endeavored to examine the safety and efficacy of
    vaginal dinoprostone versus placebo in controlling pain during IUD insertion. We included five
    high quality randomized controlled trials comprising 862 patients (dinoprostone, n=431 and
    placebo, n=431).
          Despite IUD insertion is relatively a quick (5-10 minutes) procedure, each step of it can
    bring about variable extents of pain (11). Sources of pain comprise speculum insertion,

    tenaculum placement, transcervical sounding of uterus, forward advancement of IUD inserter
    into uterine cavity, and postprocedural pain. When compared to placebo, our pooled analyses
    showed that dinoprostone significantly reduced pain at tenaculum placement, transcervical
    sounding of uterus, and IUD insertion. This clinically meaningful pain reduction was positively
    correlated with increased patient-reported procedural satisfaction and decreased requirement
    for additional postprocedural analgesia. Nonetheless, although pain after IUD insertion was
    reduced, this pain reduction did not reach statistical significance. The lack of statistically
    significant pain reduction after IUD insertion could be credited to the variable time points that
    were used to assess this parameter across all the pooled four studies (10, 15, 20, and 30 min).
          Our findings indicated that dinoprostone was correlated with significantly increased ease of
    IUD insertion by healthcare providers. Nonetheless, the IUD insertion time was not substantially
    impacted. This increased ease of insertion score could be ascribed to the favorable cervical
    ripening effects of dinoprostone (15, 28). Mechanistically, dinoprostone initiates cervical
    softening through stimulation of interleukin 8 (IL-8), which in turn facilitates influx of
    polymorphonuclear leukocyte neutrophils that orchestrate remodeling of cervical extracellular
    matrix and induction of progesterone withdrawal (28).
          There are some risk factors that may subscribe to more severe pain perception during IUD
    insertion. Such factors comprise nulliparity, women who delivered only by cesarean section,
    and use of LNG-IUS (25, 26, 29). When compared to parous women, nulliparous women
    relatively possess narrower uterine cavities which may not properly fit the dimensions of
    conventional IUDs, thus culminating in higher IUD insertion pain (7). Moreover, while a history
    of cesarean section does not automatically preclude IUD insertion, nevertheless, a structurally

    disfigured uterus secondary to repetitive cesarean section may potentially correlate with
    difficult IUD insertion and discomfort (30). Lastly, the comparatively thicker diameter of LNG-
    IUS inserter (ranging from 4.65 to 4.85 mm) contrasted to Cu-IUD counterpart (around 4.0 mm)
    may cause more pain during insertion (29). In our study, subgroup analyses according to parity
    and device of contraception (data not shown) revealed that dinoprostone equally significantly
    correlated with better pain control, patient satisfaction, and ease of IUD insertion during the
    procedure when compared to placebo. This study suggests that dinoprostone can yield
    successful insertion of IUD in both nulliparous and parous women with favorable efficacy
    outcomes.
          Our summary data depicted that side effects did not significantly differ between
    dinoprostone and placebo groups. Fever was the only drug-related side effect that was
    significantly higher in the dinoprostone group when compared to placebo group. This side
    effect is, to a larger degree, expected as the association between prostaglandin E2 and
    occurrence of fever is well documented in literature (31). Other than fever which can be
    adequately and conservatively managed by antipyretics, our study suggests dinoprostone is
    highly effective and associated with satisfactory safety profile.
          Dinoprostone is widely used for the obstetric indication of labor induction owing to
    favorable cervical softening and uterine contractility properties (15, 28). A meta-analysis
    demonstrated that while dinoprostone is efficaciously equivalent to misoprostol in labor
    induction, it is associated with better toxicity profile, particularly in terms of lower frequencies
    of tachysystole and hypertonic uterine dysfunction (16). Also, use of dinoprostone has been
    extended to non-obstetric indications such as hysteroscopy in nulliparous (17) and

    postmenopausal (18) women and correlated with better pain control and ease of procedure
    when compared to placebo or misoprostol. This study further supports the clinical utility of
    dinoprostone in an additional non-obstetric indication—that is, during IUD insertion to control
    procedure-related pain and facilitate its ease of conduction.
          The optimal method of pain relief during IUD insertion remains undefined (12, 13). A
    contemporary systematic review and network meta-analysis of numerous lines of
    pharmacologic analgesic interventions showed that lidocaine-prilocaine cream (genital mucosal
    application) was the most effective intervention for controlling IUD insertion-related pain (14).
    Dinoprostone was not included in the aforementioned network meta-analysis. Thus, future
    research should be geared toward direct comparison of efficacy and safety of vaginal
    dinoprostone versus lidocaine-prilocaine cream (and other active comparators such as
    misoprostol, lidocaine, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) in controlling pain associated
    with IUD insertion. This should be achieved through development of well-designed randomized
    controlled trials that take into account women who are at high risk for more painful
    experiences, such as nulliparous women, women who delivered only by cesarean section,
    women who failed previous insertions, and women who will receive the comparatively thicker
    LNG-IUS (as opposed to Cu-IUD) devices.
          Dinoprostone possesses two major drawbacks that ought to be acknowledged. First, from a
    financial perspective, it is costly when compared to its closely related comparator misoprostol
    (32, 33). Second, from a physiochemical perspective, it is unstable at room temperature and
    should be stored in freezer/refrigerator until before use to preserve its potency (12).

          This study has several strengths. First, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis
    that pooled the efficacy and safety of vaginal dinoprostone versus placebo in controlling pain
    during IUD insertion. We included only randomized placebo-controlled trials (n=5) to lessen
    potentials of bias and confounding in our pooled conclusions. All included studies were of high
    quality and low risk of bias. We strictly adhered to PRISMA guidelines during the conduction of
    this research. Moreover, we reported many efficacy and safety endpoints. All in all, our study
    suggests the beneficial role of vaginal dinoprostone for a non-obstetric indication, which is
    controlling pain during IUD insertion. Nonetheless, this study has some limitations that should
    be recognized. Such limitations comprise the subjective evaluation of pain which may be
    impacted by the patients’ sociodemographics or pre-anxiety levels. The studies varied
    substantially with regard to timing of vaginal dinoprostone administration, ranging from two to
    12 hours prior to IUD insertion, as well as timing of assessing pain after IUD insertion, ranging
    from 10 to 30 mins. All these variations could have negatively impacted the factual assessment
    of the efficacy endpoint. Importantly, the optimal timing of dinoprostone administration is yet
    to be determined. Lastly, all the included studies originated from one country/institute, thus
    relatively limiting the generalizability of the outcomes.
    Conclusions
    This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that vaginal dinoprostone is correlated with
    increased ease of insertion by providers, higher satisfaction by patients, and decreased IUD
    insertion-related pain. Moreover, dinoprostone is largely safe with very tolerable toxicity
    profile. All in all, this study supports the clinical utility of vaginal dinoprostone for pain relief
