    Abstract
    The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to
    have had a widespread impact on mental healthcare service provision and use. Previous reports
    from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider
    for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing
    community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the
    pandemic’s first wave. However, there is a need to quantify this for individuals with particular
    vulnerabilities, including those with learning disabilities. Taking advantage of the Clinical
    Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental
    health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and
    virtual) for individuals with learning disabilities across community, specialist, crisis and
    inpatient services. The report focussed on the period 1st January to 31st July 2020. We also report
    on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient
    admissions and discharges for individuals with learning disabilities. In addition, daily deaths are
    described for all current and previous SLaM service users with learning disabilities over this
    period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from
    face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. The largest declines in caseloads and
    total contacts were seen in Home Treatment Team, Liaison/A&E and Older Adult teams.
    Reduced accepted referrals and inpatient admissions were observed and there was an 103%
    increase in average daily deaths in the period after 16th March, compared to the period 1st
                                                                                                                                              1

    was considered alone).
    Background
    The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges for mental healthcare provision due
    to a combination of factors, including the impact of the virus itself, the impact of social
    distancing policies on delivery of mental healthcare, as well as potential psychological effects of
    social distancing restrictions. Mental healthcare challenges have included the increased
    vulnerability of its patients, already-reduced life expectancies, pre-existing problems in
    healthcare access, increased staff sickness and isolation, COVID-19 infections (suspected or
    confirmed) across inpatient and outpatient services, and the need to minimize face-to-face
    contacts (1). Impacts may be higher for people with learning disabilities, due to changes in
    healthcare provision and increased physical and mental health multimorbidity. However, these
    have received little description to date.
    We have previously reported on the mental healthcare impact of the UK COVID-19 pandemic
    via the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data platform which receives 24-hourly
    updates from its source electronic mental health records. Previous pandemic era reports are listed
    on https://www.maudsleybrc.nihr.ac.uk/facilities/clinical-record-interactive-search-cris/covid-
    19-publications/. This has included a sizeable shift from face-to-face to virtual contacts in
    community mental health teams and home treatment teams, as well as a decrease in caseloads
    and total contacts in home treatment teams (2). We are seeking to extend this analysis to groups
    who might have specific needs and service use characteristics that might not be well reflected in
    Trust-wide data. This report focuses on service users with diagnosed learning disabilities.
    Methods
    The Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) Case Register at the South London and Maudsley NHS
    Foundation Trust (SLaM) has been described previously (3;4). SLaM serves a geographic
    catchment of four south London boroughs (Croydon, Lambeth, Lewisham, Southwark) with a
                                                                                                                                       2

    population of around 1.2 million residents and has used a fully electronic health record (EHR)
    across all its services since 2006. SLaM’s BRC Case Register was set up in 2008, providing
    researcher access to de-identified data from SLaM’s EHR via the Clinical Record Interactive
    Search (CRIS) platform and within a robust security model and governance framework (5). CRIS
    has been extensively developed over the last 10 years with a range of external data linkages and
    natural language processing resources (6). CRIS is updated from SLaM’s EHR every 24 hours
    and thus provides relatively ‘real-time’ data. SLaM’s EHR is itself immediately updated every
    time an entry is made, which include date-stamped fields indicating patient contacts (‘events’)
    and those indicating acceptance of a referral or a discharge from a given service (or SLaM care
    more generally). Mortality in the complete EHR (i.e. all SLaM patients with records, past or
    present) is ascertained weekly through automated checks of National Health Service (NHS)
    numbers (a unique identifier used in all UK health services) against a national spine; this
    provides confirmation of date of death but no further information (e.g. on recorded causes).
    CRIS has received approval as a data source for secondary analyses (Oxford Research Ethics
    Committee C, reference 18/SC/0372) and has supported over 200 peer reviewed publications to
    date
    Activity and caseload data were extracted via CRIS and enumerated for every day from 1st
    January 2020 to 31st July 2020. The focus of this report is on clinical activity and mortality of
    individuals diagnosed with learning disability; this was defined on the basis of ICD-10 codes
    F7x, F84x or F90x within structured fields for primary or secondary diagnoses in the source
    electronic health record (mandatory fields for all active caseloads), supplemented by ‘leaning
    dis*’ applied to output from a bespoke natural language processing algorithm developed within
    CRIS to extract text associated with diagnostic statements recorded in open text fields
    (https://www.maudsleybrc.nihr.ac.uk/facilities/clinical-record-interactive-search-cris/cris-
    natural-language-processing/). This supplementary approach allowed for the fact that learning
    disability is under-reported in coded diagnostic fields in favour of other co-occurring diagnoses.
    Clinical activity was measured across 6 service areas: working age community Adult Mental
    Health Services (AMHS), Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), Mental
    Health of Older Adults (MHOA), Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP), Home Treatment Team
                                                                                                                                       3

    and crisis services (HTT), and Liaison Accident & Emergency (A&E) services. Total Trust
    caseloads, number of accepted and discharged Trust referrals, number of inpatient admissions
    and discharges, and number of inpatients (total and those specifically under a Mental Health Act
    order) were also extracted for the client group. For AMHS, CAMHS, MHOA, EIP, HTT,
    Liaison, daily caseloads were calculated by ascertaining patients who were receiving active care
    from the service on a given day, based on the date a referral to that service was recorded as
    accepted to the point a discharge was made from that service. Daily contact numbers were
    ascertained from recorded ‘events’ (i.e. standard case note entries) for that service and were
    divided into the following groups according to structured compulsory meta-data fields for that
    event in the EHR: i) face-to-face contacts attended; ii) virtual contacts attended (by email, fax,
    mail, phone, online, or video link); iii) total contacts, as the sum of these two; iv) did not attend
    (DNA).
    Finally, mortality data (number of deaths for all patients with learning disability with SLaM
    records) were extracted for the period in question. Data extractions for this manuscript were
    carried out on 10th September 2020.
    Descriptive data were generated daily for the above parameters and displayed graphically.
    Weekend days and national holidays were omitted for AMHS, CAMHS, MHOA, and EIP
    contacts. For comparisons between time periods, 16th March 2020 was chosen, as the date social
    distancing policy was announced by the UK government. Mean (SD) activity levels were
    described before and after this date and percentage changes quantified.
    Results
    Mean daily statistics before and after 16th March and proportional changes are displayed in Table
    1. Weekly deaths in the period from 1st January to 31st July are displayed in Figure 1. Mean daily
    deaths for individuals with learning disabilities significantly increased by 103% in the period
    after 16th March compared to the period between 1st January to 15th March, although the primary
    excess was observed up to mid-May. If the 2-month period from 16th March to 15th May was

    taken as a comparison instead, the mean daily deaths rose to 0.97, a difference of 0.71 and an
    increase of 282%.
    The daily Trust total caseload for service users with learning disabilities is displayed in Figure 2,
    and daily accepted and discharged trust referral numbers are displayed in Figure 3. The mean
    number of accepted referrals decreased by 32%, and the number of discharges showed a
    relatively small reduction by 6%. The mean overall daily Trust caseload was reduced by 6%.
    Data on inpatient care are displayed in Figures 4-5, showing a fall in daily inpatient numbers (by
    22% overall and by 17% for those under the Mental Health Act), reflecting a high level of
    discharges in late March and early April (Figure 4).
    AMHS daily contacts are displayed in Figure 6 and daily caseloads are displayed in Figure 7.
    Mean total daily contacts showed a relatively small increase (6%) overall after 15th March. Face-
    to-face contacts were reduced by 56%, and virtual contacts were increased by 199%. However,
    mean daily caseloads were reduced only marginally by 5%.
    CAMHS daily contacts are displayed in Figure 8 and daily caseloads are displayed in Figure 9.
    Mean total daily contacts were reduced by 7%, with an 87% reduction in face-to-face contacts,
    and a 174% increase in virtual contacts. Mean daily caseloads were reduced by 6%.
    EIP daily contacts are displayed in Figure 10 and daily caseloads are displayed in Figure 11.
    Mean total daily contacts showed an increase of 17%: a 69% reduction in face-to-face contacts
    accompanied by a 221% increase in virtual contacts. Mean daily caseloads remained relatively
    unchanged with a 1% increase.
    HTT daily contacts are displayed in Figure 12 and daily caseloads are displayed in Figure 13.
    Mean total daily contacts were reduced by 14% overall after 15th March, made up of an 32%
    reduction in face-to-face contacts and a 63% reduction in virtual contacts. Mean daily caseloads
    were reduced by 21%.

    Liaison A&E daily contacts are displayed in Figure 14 and daily caseloads are displayed in
    Figure 15. Mean total daily contacts were reduced by 9%: a 13% reduction in face-to-face
    contacts and a 42% increase in virtual contacts. Mean daily caseloads were reduced by 15%.
    MHOA daily contacts are displayed in Figure 16 and daily caseloads are displayed in Figure 17.
    Mean total daily contacts were reduced by 32%: a 47% reduction in face-to-face contacts and a
    4% increase in virtual contacts. Mean daily caseloads reduced by 18%.
    Discussion
    Comparing periods before and after the 16th of March 2020 in terms of the overall Trust activity
    for individuals with learning disabilities, total caseload numbers remained relatively unchanged
    (a 6% decrease), although inpatient numbers were reduced more substantially (by 22%) because
    of discharges made in the early period of lockdown. Caseloads were reduced in all specific
    services, but most substantially in HTT (21%), MHOA (18%) and Liaison/A&E (15%), and were
    least changed in EIP (1%), AMHS (5%) and CAMHS (6%).
    All specific services also recorded reductions in face-to-face and increases in virtual contacts.
    Total contact numbers declined most in MHOA (by 32%), followed by HTT (14%),
    Liaison/A&E (9%) and CAMHS (7%), and were increased in AMHS (by 6%) and EIP (17%).
    However, it should be borne in mind that contact numbers were relatively low in some services
    (MHOA in particular).
    Mean daily deaths increased by 103% for the period after 16th March compared to the daily mean
    for 2020 up to this date; however, the period from 16th March to 31st July included both the peak
    wave of increased mortality and a period with relatively few deaths. As described, the increase
    rose to 282% if the mid-March to mid-May period was considered specifically.
    Considering limitations, it is important to bear in mind that the data are derived from a single
    site. Because complete data are being provided for that site with no hypothetical source
    population intended, calculation of confidence intervals was not felt to be appropriate for the
                                                                                                                                       6

    descriptive data provided in this report; applicability to other mental healthcare providers cannot
    therefore be inferred and would need specific investigation. Profiles of services used by
    individuals with learning disabilities and catchment morbidity are also likely to vary. It is also
    likely that we did not capture all of the services individuals with learning disabilities are
    currently accessing for mental healthcare, as well as undiagnosed individuals. Classification of
    service types is inevitably approximate and likely to vary between mental health service
    providers. Finally, no attempt was made to adjust for temporal changes (e.g. seasonal effects)
    that might be observed in previous years’ data.
