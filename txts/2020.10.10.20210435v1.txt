         ABSTRACT
         Background Home injury (HI) is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in adults of
         all ages. Health conditions significantly impact HI among old adults, but little is known for
         other adults.
         Study design Prospective cohort study
         Objective: We assessed the associations between health-related factors and HI's risk in a
         French study, the MAVIE cohort.
         Methods Poisson mixed models were fitted using health-related data information (diseases,
         treatments, and disabilities) at baseline and the number of injuries prospectively recorded
         during the follow-up, adjusting for significant socio-demographics and exposure to a range of
         home activities. Attributable fractions (AFs) were estimated based on RR estimations
         measured in the fully adjusted models.
         Results A total of 6,146 dwelling adults aged 15 or more were followed up for 5.1 years on
         average. Vertigo or dizziness (RR=2.36, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.01) and sciatica or back pain
         (RR=1.49, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.05) were independently associated with an increased risk of HI.
         These two groups of conditions showed the most significant associations among people aged
         15 to 49, whereas musculoskeletal diseases other than rachialgias and arthropathies were the
         most significant health-related risk factor in people aged 50 and more. Sciatica or back pain
         represented the highest-burden of HIs in overall adults (8%) and among people aged 15 to 49
         (12%).
         Conclusion Our results suggest that adults with musculoskeletal disorders and vertigo or
         dizziness symptoms have a higher risk of HI, regardless of age.

         INTRODUCTION
         Home injuries (HIs) represent approximately one-third of the global burden of injuries1 2 3. In
         the EU-28, HIs caused an annual average of 85 thousand fatalities, 1.5 million hospital
         admissions, and 9 million emergencies between 2012 and 20144. Home has been identified as
         the most prevalent location for injuries resulting in hospitalization and is second to roads as the
         location for fatal injuries5.
         HIs affect people of all ages. However, among adults, HIs are more frequent in people aged 65
         years or over. Falls are the principal mechanism of fatal and non-fatal HIs4.
         Multiple studies have identified health-related factors associated with falls in the elderly,
         including: lack of strength gait and balance, mobility impairment6–8, back pain9 10,
         arthropathies8 11, dizziness and vertigo8 12 13, obesity14, diabetes7 8 11, cardiovascular
         conditions7 8 11, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease11, urinary incontinence8, visual and
         hearing impairments7, cognition impairments caused by neurological conditions such as
         Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease or other types of dementia6–8, and sleeping problems,
         anxiety or depression6–8 11. The presence of two or more concurrent conditions8 and certain
         medications, such as psychotropics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, sedatives or hypnotics15,
         opioids16, cardiac medication, diuretics, anti-diabetic medication7, and polypharmacy17 are
         also associated with falls in the elderly.
         Among young and middle-aged adults, understanding the impact of health risk factors on HI is
         poor18 19. Regarding the risk of occupational injuries, there is some evidence of the role of
         hearing impairments, neurotic illness, diabetes21, epilepsy, and sedating medication20.
         Conditions such as back pain, sleeping problems, anxiety, depression, cardiovascular diseases,
         and diabetes21 can also be frequent in young and middle-aged adults, which justifies evaluating
         their impact on adults of all ages.

         The purpose of this study was to assess associations of health-related factors on the risk of non-
         fatal HI in adults of all ages in a prospective cohort, the MAVIE cohort.
         METHODS
         Study design and recruitment
         The MAVIE cohort is a web-based prospective cohort study conducted in France, with a
         longitudinal follow-up of Home, Leisure, and Sports Injuries (HLIs). All households in France
         and French overseas territories were eligible to participate. The recruitment process began in
         November 2014. The present study analyzed the data collected up to December 31, 2019.
         Cohort management was entirely online, including invitations, registration, and data
         collection. Participants were recruited through an email invitation sent to their insurees by
         three mutual insurance companies, press releases, social media, posters, and flyers.
         We asked potential participants to choose a household reference member in charge of
         completing a web-based questionnaire for the household. Consenting members of each
         household were asked to provide individual information. In an attempt to address the
         foreseeable underrepresentation of the elderly who may have difficulties using computers,
         caregivers were invited to represent and participate on behalf of one older person.
         Follow-up
         Every three months, household reference members received an email reminder to report any
         injury event to any consenting household members during the follow-up. If no event occurred,
         respondents were requested to report this. An invitation to report events was also included in
         the monthly cohort newsletter. Still, events could be reported at any time.

         The inclusion criteria for participation in the MAVIE cohort were: i) residing in France; ii)
         being able to answer the questionnaires in French; iii) having access to and being able to use
         the Internet (at least the reference member). The baseline sample was defined as the
         participants aged 15 or over who answered at least one question of the individual inclusion
         questionnaire. We excluded those who lived in hospitals and retirement or long-term care
         institutions. We considered only participants who reported at least one feedback during
         follow-up and respondents to the daily schedule.
         Home Injuries
         This study focused on unintentional home injuries or its premises. We excluded all events
         involving illnesses or medical symptoms. We excluded events that occurred before or on the
         same date as the date of consent and those for which information about the type of medical
         care or the circumstances of occurrence was not reported. Finally, we excluded injuries that
         occurred during sleeping time, considered unlikely1.
         Data included activity and location, mechanisms and type of medical care of the injury event.
         We defined HIs as severe when emergency care or hospital inpatient care was required.
         Individual characteristics
         Relative time distribution
         Participants were asked to report their typical daily schedule in hours for each home location.
         The average duration was also reported for domestic work, gardening, and do-it-yourself
         (DIY) activities. Time spent on each activity was categorized as frequent (over the 75th
         percentile), occasional or null.
         Socioeconomic, demographic characteristics, and alcohol consumption

         Gender, age, occupational status, education level, living situation, household incomes, and
         alcohol consumption were studied at baseline. Occupational status groups were unemployed,
         homemakers, and retirees and students and employees. Responses to education status were
         assigned to educational attainment levels by age groups. We considered a low level of
         education high school or vocational studies, or lower for participants aged 20 to 54, and
         primary studies or lower for other ages. Annual household incomes were assigned to classes
         according to the French population’s percentiles reported in 2015 (Low: ≤ 30th percentile,
         Middle: 30th-80th percentile, High: ≥ 80th percentile). The categories of the frequency of
         alcohol consumption were less than two times a week, and two or more times a week.
         Health conditions and medications
         At inclusion, participants were invited to report their history of diseases and treatments over
         the previous 12 months.
         Medical conditions were grouped into the following clinically homogeneous categories:
         cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, genitourinary diseases, endocrine
         diseases, sciatica or back pain, arthropathies, other conditions of the musculoskeletal system, eye
         diseases, depression, anxiety, sleeping disorders (including treatment with antidepressants,
         anxiolytics or hypnotics), migraine or headache, vertigo or dizziness, chronic mental diseases
         (Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease or other senile dementia, epilepsy, and antiepileptic
         medicines), and cancer. Participants were also asked to report whether they were suffering from
         impairments or disabilities related to vision, hearing, mental, intellectual, or psychological,
         and mobility.
         We defined polypharmacy as a reported number of medications of 4 or more17, and
         comorbidity as the report of two or more diseases22 at any time in the previous 12 months. The
         history of injuries (excluding sports injuries) over the past 12 months was also reported.

         Statistical analyses
         Data were analyzed using R version 3.6.1 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
         Vienna, Austria)
         We defined the follow-up period (FP) from the consent date to the latest date among the
         following: the latest news statement date, the questionnaires update date, the cohort exit date,
         the death date. We calculated the proportion of time spent awake at home (PTAH) as the
         proportion of hours on a weekday or weekend day when the person was neither away from
         home nor sleeping. We considered the time-at-risk as:
         Time-at-risk = (PTAHw × No. FPw) + (PTAHwn × No. FPwn) ,
         where PTAHw was the time spent awake at home regular weekday, PTAHwn on a regular
         weekend day, No. FPw the number of weekdays in the follow-up period and No. FPwn the
         number of weekend days. We calculated the proportion of time-at-risk as:
         % Time-at risk = (Time-at-risk/Follow-up duration) ×100%.
         Risk factor analysis
         Poisson mixed models were used to fit the number of HIs during the estimated time at risk.
         Random effects were included to take into account the cluster structure of data in households.
         All models were fitted using the Template Model Builder R package23. Relative risks (RRs)
         were calculated conditionally upon the random effects, and the 95% confidence intervals were
         calculated using the profile method24. We adopted a complete case approach.
         We fitted individual crude regression models to each health condition. Then, we conducted a
         two-step variable selection procedure. First, we adjusted each model by age, gender, and
         history of injuries in all models, and we selected the most important associations (padj < 0.10).
         Second, we fitted the models to each health-related factor, adjusting for significant adjustment

         variables selected in the previous step. Finally, we selected the most important associations for
         the fully adjusted model (excluding comorbidity). Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-values
         were computed 25. The same methodology was used to construct models stratified by two
         distinct age groups (15 to 49 years old and 50 years old or more).
         The attributable fraction (AF) was estimated using the adjusted RR of the fully adjusted
         models, as suggested by Flegal and colleagues, 200626.
         RESULTS
         Between November 2014 and December 2019, 11,420 adults registered in the MAVIE cohort
         and responded to baseline questionnaires. Among them, 9,429 were household reference
         members representing themselves and/or another household member. Sixty-six participants
         reported that living in a retirement institution, and 3,524 participants did not provide follow-
         up data. Another 1,684 participants did not provide their daily schedule (Figure 1). The
         sample size was 6,146 participants from 5,122 households.
         The median follow-up was 4.0 years (Q1=3.6, Q3=4.5). The overall follow-up duration was
         4,800 persons-time. The loss to follow-up was 13%.
         Among the 6,146 individuals of the study, 244 left the cohort during the follow-up. Nineteen
         of them were reported by the reference member to have died, 16 from illness, and three of
         unknown causes. Thirty-one participants left the study due to changes in household
         composition. The remaining 191 participants did not report any reasons for leaving the study.
         Socioeconomic, demographic characteristics, and alcohol consumption levels were similar to
         those of the study sample and baseline sample (Table 1). However, dropout was more frequent
         among young adults, students, and employees, and among members of low-income
         households.

         Baseline characteristics
         Socioeconomic, demographic characteristics, and alcohol consumption
         Table 1 shows the socioeconomic, demographic characteristics, and alcohol consumption of
         the sample at baseline. Sample characteristics differed from those of the overall French
         population (INSEE Census, 2015). Participants aged 50 to 74 were overrepresented (62% vs.
         35% in the French population, 2015). Students and employees were underrepresented (49% vs.
         57%). People with low education attainment level were underrepresented (8% vs. 44%). Finally,
         only 12% of household reference members reported an annual income lower than the 30th
         percentile of French households.
         The median proportion of time spent at home awake was 48% (Q1=36%, Q3=58%). Adults
         older than 50, unemployed, retirees, homemakers, and those who reported gardening, DIY,
         and domestic activities were those who spent the most time at home (Supplementary material
         1).
         Health conditions, diseases, and medications
         Among the 6,146 participants, 67% reported at least one health condition (Figure 2). They
         were older, with a median age of 60 compared to 35 for those who did not report any health
         condition. Figure 2 shows the most frequently reported health conditions by age group.
         Almost half of the participants (48%) reported more than one health condition. The most
         frequently reported conditions among adults aged 15 to 49 years were depression, anxiety, or
         sleeping disorders, and among adults aged 50 and more, cardiovascular diseases. Eight
         percent of participants reported at least one type of injury in the last 12 months.

         During follow-up, 12% of the participants reported at least one HI, of which 946 occurred
         while awake. Most of HIs were minor injuries, and only 28% required either hospitalization
         or emergency care. Falling was the main mechanism of HI (39 %), domestic and gardening
         activities (42%), the most frequents activities, and the garden (25%) the most frequent
         location (Supplementary Material 2).
         Health risk factor analysis
         Adjusting for the selected variables of block 1 (Table 2), vertigo or dizziness, sciatica or back
         pain, arthropathies, other musculoskeletal system diseases, depression, anxiety or sleeping
         disorders, and comorbidity were associated with an increased risk of HI in adults of all ages
         with a small or moderate effect (Block 2, Table 2). In the fully adjusted model (Table 3),
         vertigo or dizziness and sciatica or back pain remained associated with an increased risk of HI
         and with an AF of 1.9% and 8.1%, respectively. The contribution of depression, anxiety, and
         sleeping disorders was also important (AF=5.5), but the association was weaker than the
         conditions named above (RR = 1.28, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.70).
         Results of the fully adjusted models were similar for participants aged 15 to 49, but the effects
         of sciatica or back pain and vertigo or dizziness effects were higher than among adults of all
         ages (Table 4). The category of other musculoskeletal system diseases covered the only
         conditions significantly associated with the risk of HI among participants aged 50 or more
         (Table 4). All models converged, and their residuals were validated, discounting problems,
         such as over/underdispersion and zero inflation.
         DISCUSSION
         To our knowledge, we present here the first study to evaluate the association of health
         conditions with the risk of non-fatal HIs in adults of all ages. We followed up 6,146 cohort
         10

         participants residing in French households, of whom 12% suffered at least one HI over an
         average of 5.1 years. The same proportion was 14% among those who reported at least one
         health condition. Among the 21 health conditions reported at inclusion, we identified sciatica or
         back pain problems and vertigo or dizziness as the main risk factors, with an estimated AF of
         8.1% and 1.9%, respectively.
         This unprecedented finding of substantially increased risk of HI among adults under 50 years
         old with sciatica or back pain (RR=2.26) and vertigo or dizziness (RR=4.59) is striking
         because of these high association measures, but also because of a substantial estimated AF
         (11.9% and 3.2%, respectively). For people over 50 years old, musculoskeletal diseases (other
         than rachialgia and arthropathies) are the only condition that remained significant in the fully
         adjusted model. These same factors associated with mobility emerged when we analyzed falls
         and shocks only, whereas this was not the case for other HIs. That suggests that most health
         conditions affecting the risk of HI are increasing the risk of falling. Other factors usually
         associated with injuries and falls, such as gender, age, vision and hearing impairments,
         polypharmacy, and alcohol consumption, did not appear to be associated with an increased
         risk of HI in this study.
         Musculoskeletal conditions (including back pain) and sciatica are well-known risk factors for
         occupational injury, likely due to overexertion. Overexertion was reported only in the 18% of
         injuries of people suffering from musculoskeletal conditions. Consistent with previous
         findings, the effects of arthropathies (RR=1.37) and other musculoskeletal conditions
         (RR=1.57) were more relevant among adults over 50 years old8 11. In contrast to previous
         studies, back pain did not appear to be associated with an increased risk of HI in adults over
         509,10. One possible explanation is that older people may favor chronic conditions over
         problems such as back pain when self-reporting. We hypothesize that poor posture might

         affect housework performance, increasing general injury susceptibility. Decreased cognitive
         function due to chronic pain27 or opioid use16 might also raise HI risk.
         Vertigo or dizziness increased the risk of HI among young adults, but not among those aged
         50 or more. This group of symptoms may be related to vestibular migraine, benign
         paroxysmal positional vertigo, and Meniere’s disease28, rather than age-related conditions
         such as Parkinson’s disease, or cerebellum and oculomotor brain stem syndrome29. Other
         possible causes of vertigo, such as hypoglycemic episodes or postural hypotension, have been
         partially controlled for by adjusting for other conditions such as endocrine diseases and
         cardiovascular diseases.
         We found a slightly increased risk of HI among those reporting depression, anxiety, or
         sleeping disorders. Consistently, Palmer and colleagues (2018) highlighted an increased risk of
         occupational injury among people with emotional conditions, and a moderate effect among
         sedatives consumers20. Another explanation might be the difficulties in assessing risks and a
         reduced motivation to correct them in people who have affective psychological disorders. Such
         an effect was observed for patients with Parkinson’s disease30.
         Unlike other studies20 31, we found no association regarding age and disability. Because we
         could account for the time spent at home, our results confirm that exposure time is the main
         explanation1 32–34. A relevant self- perception of disability allows compensation for an increased
         risk of injury, enabling enhanced care in daily activities and avoiding risky tasks and domestic
         hazards. People with moderate conditions, more active in domestic work, and less aware of
         risks might be more exposed to hazards together they might insufficiently regulate their
         behavior. On the other hand, these effects may be mitigated by the beneficial impacts of
         domestic activities35, for example, by improving executive functions36.
         Lessons for prevention from our results include better awareness of risks at home for people
         with diseases related to the musculoskeletal system. Our results also highlight the preventive

         role of physicians when dealing with vulnerable people. However, HI risk related to the level
         of activities should not discourage leisure activities and help raise awareness and adaptation of
         the living environment to the risks by mapping foreseeable hazards.
         Limitations and Strengths
         Common limitations observed in volunteer-based cohorts and e-cohorts are low response
         rates, volunteer bias, loss of follow-up, and self-administered questionnaires, leading to
         selection biases and missing and selective answers. We made continuous efforts to address
         representativeness, loss to follow-up, and quality of information issues. However, young
         adults and people from low socioeconomic groups and levels of educational attainment were
         underrepresented. An overestimation of the prevalence and impact of some diseases is
         probable. The difficulty of diagnosing the conditions, the ability to recall, the willingness to
         report (mostly when communicated by reference members), physical and mental quality of
         life may also affect the report37. Besides, this study design does not allow us to disentangle the
         effects of health conditions and treatments. Moreover, information about disease severity, risk
         behaviors, and risk awareness was not available. Finally, we measured health conditions at a
         single time point; health changes were not assessed over time.
         Conclusion
         Despite these limitations, the MAVIE cohort is the injury observatory with the most detailed
         sociodemographic, contextual, and exposure information to study risk factors of HLIs in
         France. This information enabled us to control for potential confounders and account for
         exposure time, the latter being a rare opportunity.

         What is already known on the subject?
              •     There is evidence that a large number of health conditions increase home injury risk in
                    older adults.
              •     Musculoskeletal system diseases increase the risk of falls at home in older adults
                    through weakness, loss of posture and balance.
              •     There is a lack of evidence on how health conditions affect the risk of home injury in
                    younger adults.
         What this study adds?
              •     Our results suggest a moderate to high effect of musculoskeletal system diseases and
                    vertigo or dizziness symptoms over home injury risk regardless of age.
              •     Back pain or sciatica is the group of conditions with the highest attributable fraction of
                    home injury risk among all adults and adults under 50 years old.
