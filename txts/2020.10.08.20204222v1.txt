 1     Abstract
 2     Virologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been central to the COVID-19 pandemic response, but
 3     interpreting changes in incidence and fraction of positive tests towards understanding the
 4     epidemic trajectory is confounded by changes in testing practices. Here, we show that the
 5     distribution of viral loads, in the form of Cycle thresholds (Ct), from positive surveillance samples
 6     at a single point in time can provide accurate estimation of an epidemic’s trajectory, subverting
 7     the need for repeated case count measurements which are frequently obscured by changes in
 8     testing capacity. We identify a relationship between the population-level cross-sectional
 9     distribution of Ct values and the growth rate of the epidemic, demonstrating how the skewness
10     and median of detectable Ct values change purely as a mathematical epidemiologic rule without
11     any change in individual level viral load kinetics or testing. Although at the individual level
12     measurement variation can complicate interpretation of Ct values for clinical use, we show that
13     population-level properties reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. In support of these theoretical
14     findings, we observe a strong relationship between the time-varying effective reproductive
15     number, R(t), and the distribution of Cts among positive surveillance specimens, including median
16     and skewness, measured in Massachusetts over time. We use the observed relationships to
17     derive a novel method that allows accurate inference of epidemic growth rate using the distribution
18     of Ct values observed at a single cross-section in time, which, unlike estimates based on case
19     counts, is less susceptible to biases from delays in test results and from changing testing
20     practices. Our findings suggest that instead of discarding individual Ct values from positive
21     specimens, incorporation of viral loads into public health data streams offers a new approach for
22     real-time resource allocation and assessment of outbreak mitigation strategies, even where
23     repeat incidence data is not available. Ct values or similar viral load data should be regularly
24     reported to public health officials by testing centers and incorporated into monitoring programs.

25     Introduction
26     Tracking trends in the incidence of infection during an epidemic are vital for deciding on
27     appropriate public health response measures (1–3). This information can help decision-makers
28     understand the need for and efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions, to plan the deployment
29     of public health resources, and the use of scarce hospital beds and personal protective
30     equipment. In the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic,
31     estimating the outbreak trajectory and key epidemiological parameters such as the time-varying
32     effective reproductive number, R(t), has generally been done by using daily observed case
33     counts, percent of tests positive, or death counts, ideally confirmed by reverse-transcription
34     quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing. Because of the nonspecific symptoms
35     and variable incubation periods of COVID-19 (4, 5), the limited and time-varying availability of
36     testing in many parts of the world, including in the United States, and the delay between infections
37     and reported tests or confirmed deaths (6), these approaches are limited in their ability to reliably
38     and promptly detect underlying changes in infection counts (7). In particular, whether changes in
39     case counts at different times have stemmed from changes in testing or reflect epidemic growth
40     or decay have been major topics of debate with important economic, health and political
41     ramifications.
42     Virologic testing is an important method for determining the infection status of an individual and
43     the prevalence of infection in a community. RT-qPCR testing is currently the primary approach
44     for virus detection (8, 9). While these tests have quantitative results in the form of cycle threshold
45     (Ct) values, which are inversely correlated with log 10 viral loads, they are often reported only as
46     binary results (10, 11). Previous work for other infectious diseases has focused on identifying
47     correlations between Ct values and clinical severity and transmissibility (12–14). In addition, Ct
48     values or viral loads may be useful in clinical determinations about the need for isolation and
49     quarantine for SARS-CoV-2 (11, 15), in determining the phase of an individual’s infection (16, 17)
50     and predicting disease severity (16, 18).
51     Using viral loads for clinical and epidemiological purposes requires an understanding of the viral
52     load kinetics over the course of infection. For SARS-CoV-2, this has not been fully characterized
53     due to difficulties in quickly identifying and repeatedly testing asymptomatic infections. However,
54     many salient features of the viral load trajectory have been identified using rhesus macaque
55     models and longitudinal human studies with repeated sampling after symptom onset (19–25).
                                                                                                                                          2

56     From these properties, assessments of infectiousness over the course of infection (5, 26) and
57     population-level viral load distributions by time since infection can be reconstructed (27).
58     While individual viral load kinetic trajectories may potentially be used to diagnose the clinical
59     course of infection and determine requirements of test sensitivities (27), albeit with caveats from
60     sampling variability and different testing platforms, population-level viral loads can be used for
61     epidemiological assessments of an outbreak. Sample surveys with virologic tests provide cross-
62     sectional estimation of the prevalence of infection, and repeated surveys can provide information
63     on the trends in prevalence and incidence over time (28). Population-level signals in
64     measurements obtained under the same sampling protocol and using the same instrument will
65     therefore reflect underlying epidemiological trends. However, a consistently observed but
66     currently unexplained phenomenon is that, as the epidemic declines, the distribution of observed
67     Ct values above the limit of detection appears to systematically decline (15, 16).
68     Previous work has used serologic data to infer unobserved individual-level infection events and
69     population-level parameters of infectious disease spread. In particular, antibody dynamics have
70     been used in tools to identify the infecting strain for multi-strain pathogens (29, 30) and to identify
71     the time since infection for an individual (31, 32). At the population level, repeated sampling of
72     antibody levels has been used to identify seasonal forcing mechanisms for recurrent epidemics
73     (33), estimate an average incidence rate (34–37), and identify the force of infection at various
74     time points (32, 38). Although virologic data may exhibit more heterogeneity than serological data,
75     they similarly provide single point-in-time observations of underlying within-host infection kinetics.
76     Here, we use virologic data, which can be obtained sooner after infection than antibody titers, to
77     provide real-time monitoring of epidemic dynamics, and demonstrate an approach using a single
78     cross-sectional survey.
79     In this paper, we show that the changing population distribution of Ct values obtained from positive
80     SARS-CoV-2 samples can be used to infer epidemic dynamics. Early in the epidemic, infection
81     numbers are growing rapidly and the average infection is recent; as the epidemic wanes,
82     however, average time since exposure increases as the rate of new infections decreases—
83     analogous to the average age being lower in a growing vs. declining population of organisms (39).
84     Importantly, within infected hosts, Ct values change over time: the viral population undergoes
85     rapid exponential growth after inoculation, succeeded by slower exponential decline as the
86     infection is cleared and low levels of viral RNA persist. Surveillance sampling of infected
87     individuals during epidemic growth is therefore more likely to measure individuals who were
                                                                                                                                          3

88     recently infected and therefore in the acute phase of their infection. Conversely, sampling infected
89     individuals during epidemic decline is more likely to capture individuals in the convalescent phase,
90     typically sampling lower quantities of viral RNA. We first demonstrate that rate of transmission is
91     highly correlated with the distribution of detectable Ct values in infected individuals over time using
92     both simulated and real data from Massachusetts. We then formalize this intuition into a novel
93     and robust method able to use viral load measurements (i.e., RT-qPCR Ct values or other forms
94     of virus quantitation) from single cross-sectional virologic test surveys to determine an
95     instantaneous outbreak trajectory, without need for repeated measures.

 96     Results
 97     Relationship between observed Ct values and epidemic dynamics
 98     To first demonstrate how the distribution of observed Ct values changes over the course of an
 99     outbreak, we simulate viral load trajectories from infections arising under a deterministic
100     susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model (Fig. 1A). At each day of the outbreak,
101     Ct values are observed from a random sample of the population using the population-level Ct
102     distribution model described in Materials and Methods and shown in Fig. S1. Assumed parameter
103     values for the distribution of Ct values for a given time since infection are the point estimates in
104     Table S1, capturing individual-level time courses of viral kinetics post infection and the substantial
105     variation in observations resulting from individual variation and sampling differences. By drawing
106     simulated samples for testing from across the population at specific time points, these simulations
107     recreate realistic cross-sectional distributions of detectable viral loads across the course of an
108     epidemic.
109     Throughout the course of the outbreak, shown in Fig. 1, there is a strong relationship between
110     growth rate of new infections at each timepoint, the cross-sectional distribution of time since
111     infection of RT-qPCR-detectable infections at that time point, and distribution of detectable viral
112     loads in the simulated SEIR population at that time point. To infer epidemic growth rate, we would
113     ideally observe the distribution of time since infection of infected individuals, because it is directly
114     related to the average growth rate when those individuals were infected (Fig. 1A-C). However,
115     because infections are often unobserved events, we rely on an observable quantity, such as viral
116     load, as a proxy for the time since infection (Fig. 1D-G). Throughout, we assume that there is a
117     single infection time for each individual and ignore re-infection, as it appears to be a negligible
118     portion of infections in the epidemic so far (40).
119     Since the viral load is related to time since infection for each individual (Fig. 1D), and the average
120     time since infection varies over the outbreak (Fig. 1C), the distributional properties of the
121     measured viral loads (i.e., median and skewness) vary with the growth rate of new cases (Fig.
122     1H, Fig. S2). Across individuals, this relationship holds, even after accounting for significant
123     individual level variation in peak viral loads and growth/clearance kinetics and errors in quantifying
124     viral load. This relationship holds for any observation model (i.e., using a different RT-qPCR
125     instrument or in a different lab); if the distribution of observations is an estimable function of the
126     distribution of times since infection (which it is), then the expected median and skewness of
127     observations at a given point in time are predictable from the growth rate.
                                                                                                                                           5

128     Demonstration using simulated data
129     We used our simulation framework to investigate how properties of the Ct distribution relate to
130     the effective reproductive number, R(t), if observed in a population similar to Massachusetts, USA.
131     Here, R(t) is used essentially as a reflection of the growth, or decay, of the epidemic in time. We
132     find that both the median Ct (which would vary with the individual assay) as well as the skewness
133     of the Ct distribution (which would be largely test- and lab-agnostic) show a strong correlation with
134     R(t) (Fig. 2); as R(t) declines, the median Ct of sampled individuals increases and, notably, the
135     distribution becomes more negatively skewed. An important caveat for this comparison is that
136     R(t) is the effective reproductive number on that day, whereas Ct values are observed from
137     infections generated across many days in the past.
                                                                                                                                           6

165     To investigate if our predicted relationship between the distribution of Ct values and R(t) is borne
166     out in reality, we used fully anonymized Ct values measured from nearly all hospital admissions
167     into Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA, between April 3 and August 31, 2020, and
168     aligned them with estimates for R(t) based on case counts in Massachusetts. Tests taken prior to
169     April 3 were restricted to symptomatic patients only, while those after April 15 represented
170     universal testing of all hospital admission, regardless of symptomatology. The median and
171     skewness of the Ct distribution both dropped during this period, strikingly similar to our predictions
172     for the peak and subsequent decline of an epidemic. Although the trend was the same, properties
173     of the Ct distribution exhibited higher variation across weeks, likely resulting from changes in
174     transmission intensity (e.g., due to the implementation of and adherence to interventions), small
175     sample sizes in some weeks, and potential sampling bias. In particular, it is important to note that
176     sampling was initially biased in early April towards symptomatic individuals, resulting in more
177     individuals being sampled near the peak of their viral loads (i.e., symptom onset), and therefore
178     skewing the Ct distribution towards lower values. Indeed, we were able to recreate this positive
179     skew by simulating observed Ct values with early biased sampling towards symptomatic
180     individuals (Fig. S3). Nevertheless, the relationship held. Importantly for monitoring potential, the
181     relationship demonstrated slight reductions in median Ct (increases in median viral load) and
182     slightly reduced negative skew as cases, and thus estimated R(t), began to increase again in the
183     state in July (Fig. 3).

196     Epidemic growth rates can be inferred based on cross-sectional viral load data
197     Next, we derive a method to formally infer the epidemic growth rate given a single cross-section
198     of observed, detectable Ct values. If the population-level distribution of Ct values on each day
199     post infection is known, then the distribution of observed Ct values from a largely random sample
200     of infected individuals will reflect their times since infection, which in turn reflects the growth rate
201     when those individuals were infected. The likelihood of the observed viral loads can then be
202     written as a function of the growth rate (Materials and Methods), allowing estimation of the
203     average growth rate at any time point in the outbreak. In many cases, especially for a novel
204     infection such as SARS-CoV-2, the population-level dynamics of viral loads and the resulting
205     distribution of Ct values following infection may not be known with certainty. However, available
206     data and qualitative understanding can be sufficient to define Bayesian priors for estimating key
207     viral kinetics parameters. We therefore developed a Bayesian framework to incorporate uncertain
208     prior distributions on the population-level Ct distribution as well as on the growth rate.
209     Using the same simulated population as in Fig. 2, we fit the model to cross-sectional samples at
210     5 day intervals using the Bayesian priors in Table S1. These analyses demonstrate how a
211     single cross-sectional sample of individuals may be used to estimate properties of the outbreak.
212     Fig. 4A shows the posterior growth rate estimates alongside the true growth rate at each time
213     point. The credible interval widths reflect the number of detectable Ct values included in each
214     cross-section, and also uncertainty in the viral kinetics and Ct distribution parameters. Larger
215     sample sizes than we drew here and stronger accurate priors would help constrain these
216     estimates. However, with large uncertainties incorporated in this particular version of the
217     framework, the method was still able to discern if the growth rate was positive or negative, even
218     if the point estimates were imprecise (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4C and 4D demonstrates how the model is
219     fitted to the observed Ct distribution and the corresponding time-since-infection distribution for
220     individuals observed on a particular day.

234     Discussion
235     The usefulness of Ct values for public health decision making is currently the subject of much
236     discussion and debate. One unexplained observation which has been consistently observed in
237     many locations is that the distribution of observed Ct values has decreased over the course of
238     the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which has led to questions over whether the virus has lost
239     some amount of fitness (15, 16, 18). Our results demonstrate instead that this is expected as a
240     purely epidemiologic phenomenon, without any change in individual-level viral dynamics or testing
241     practices. We find that properties of the population-level Ct distribution strongly correlate with
242     estimates for the effective reproductive number in Massachusetts in line with our theoretical
243     predictions. The method described here uses this phenomenon to estimate a community’s
244     position in the epidemic curve, as defined by the growth rate, based on a single cross-sectional
245     survey of virologic test data. We propose a simple method to monitor the skewness and median
246     of the Ct value distribution to estimate changes in the epidemic trajectory. Despite the challenges
247     of sampling variability, individual-level differences in viral kinetics, and limitations in comparing
248     results from different laboratories or instruments, our results demonstrate that Ct values, with all
249     of their quantitative variability for an individual, can be highly informative of population-level
250     dynamics. This information is lost when measurements are reduced to binary classifications.
251     These results are sensitive to the true distribution of observed viral loads each day after infection.
252     Different swab types, sample types, or instruments may alter the variability in the Ct distribution
253     (41,42), leading to different relationships between the specific Ct distribution and the epidemic
254     trajectory. Setting-specific calibrations, for example based on a reference range of Ct values, will
255     be useful to ensure accuracy. Here, we generated a viral kinetics model based on observed
256     properties of measured viral loads (proportion detectable over time following symptom onset,
257     distribution of Ct values from true specimens), and used these results to inform priors on key
258     parameters when estimating growth rates. The growth rate estimates can therefore be improved
259     by choosing more precise, accurate priors relevant to the observations used during model fitting.
260     Results could also be improved if the symptom status of the sampled individuals is known,
261     allowing the inclusion of viral kinetics parameters specific to symptomatic individuals (16, 43). The
262     same may be true if demographic features such as age are associated with viral load levels,
263     although there is limited evidence to suggest this so far (16, 18, 24, 44). The distribution could
264     also be adjusted to account for any individuals treated with antivirals, such as remdesivir, that
265     may reduce viral loads (45). A similar approach may also be possible using serologic surveys, as
                                                                                                                                         14

266     an extension of work that has related time since infection to antibody titers for other infectious
267     diseases (32, 38).
268     Our results demonstrate that this method can be used to estimate epidemic growth rates based
269     on data collected at a single time point, and independent of assumptions about the intensity of
270     testing. Comparisons of simulated Ct values and observed Ct values with growth rates and R(t)
271     estimates validate this general approach. Results should be interpreted with caution in cases
272     where the observed Ct values are not from a population census or a largely random sample.
273     When testing is based primarily on the presence of symptoms or follow-up of contacts of infected
274     individuals, people may be more likely to be sampled at specific times since infection and thus
275     the distribution of observed Cts would not be representative of the population as a whole. This
276     method may be most useful in settings where representative surveillance samples can be
277     obtained independent of COVID-19 symptoms—and importantly in cities or municipalities that
278     wish to evaluate and monitor, in real-time, the role of various epidemic mitigation interventions,
279     for example by conducting even a single random virologic testing effort as part of surveillance.
280     This method has a number of limitations. While the Bayesian framework incorporates the
281     uncertainty in viral load distributions into inference on the growth rate, parametric assumptions
282     and reasonably strong priors on these distributions aid in identifiability. If these parametric
283     assumptions are violated, inference may not be reliable. This method may also overstate
284     uncertainty in the viral load distributions if results from different machines or protocols are used
285     to inform the prior. A more precise understanding of the viral load kinetics, and modeling those
286     kinetics in a way that accounts for the epidemiologic and technical setting of the measurements,
287     will help improve this approach and determine whether Ct distribution parameters from different
288     settings are comparable. Because of this, quantitative measures from RT-qPCR should be
289     reported regularly for SARS-CoV-2 cases and early assessment of pathogen load kinetics should
290     be a priority for future emerging infections. The use of a control procedure in the measurements,
291     like using the ratio of detected viral RNA to detected human RNA, could also improve the reliability
292     and comparability of Ct measures.
293     Future research will evaluate how to incorporate these results into an overall inferential framework
294     for real-time monitoring of epidemic trajectories. In particular, we are currently adapting the
295     framework to combine multiple cross-sectional datasets, include the proportion of negative viral
296     tests in the likelihood, and to use more flexible parametric assumptions for epidemic growth. By
297     using Ct values to determine the growth rate of incident cases and using virologic positivity rates

298     to assess prevalence of infection, as well as potentially incorporating measured covariates and
299     symptom status, a richer picture of the path and likely future of an outbreak can be realized from
300     one or more virologic surveys.
301     The Ct value is a measurement with magnitude, which provides information on underlying viral
302     dynamics. Although there are challenges to relying on single Ct values for individual-level decision
303     making, the aggregation of many such measurements from a population contains substantial
304     information. These results demonstrate how population-level distributions of Ct values can
305     provide information on important epidemiologic questions of interest, even from a single cross-
306     sectional survey. Better epidemic planning and more targeted epidemiological measures can then
307     be implemented based on this survey, or use of Ct values can be combined with repeated
308     sampling to maximize the use of available evidence.

310     Model for Population-Level Ct Distribution
311     We fit a model for the distribution of viral loads at a given day after infection, 𝑎. Denote this density
312     by 𝑝𝑎 (𝑥), where x is the viral load. We denote by 𝜙𝑎 the probability that an individual will have a
313     detectable viral load a days after infection.
314     This model is fit based on several key features of the viral load kinetics that have been determined
315     for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In symptomatic cases, detectable viral loads occur prior to the onset
316     of symptoms and generally decline after symptom onset (19, 46, 47). Since infectiousness
317     appears to peak before symptom onset, viral load likely does as well (26). Challenge studies in
318     rhesus macaques indicate that viral load peaks around 2 days after infection (22, 23). Combined
319     with evidence of an incubation period in humans of around 5 days (5), these observations suggest
320     rapid exponential rise to a peak viral load during the incubation period and a high viral load upon
321     symptom onset of approximately 6–9 log10 copies RNA per mL (19, 25). However, most existing
322     viral load time series begin after symptom onset, and it is therefore difficult to corroborate
323     assumptions for the pre-symptomatic period. Waning of viral loads occurs following symptom
324     onsets, with a majority of patients undetectable around 24 days after onset (19, 20, 24, 25). At
325     any point in the infection, there is a considerable amount of person-to-person variation in viral
326     loads (19, 25), including a possible difference by symptom status (20, 48). This may also reflect
327     protocols used to test the samples and the site and method of sample collection (25).
328     We develop a parametric model for the population-level distribution of Ct values. The measured
329     Ct value a days after infection follows a Gumbel distribution with a mean that depends on a and
330     a fixed standard deviation SD. The mean log-viral load at day a follows a two-hinge function that
331     is at the true zero value of VLzero for 𝑎 ≤ 𝑡𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑓𝑡 , rises linearly to a peak log-viral load of VLpeak at
332     𝑎 = 𝑡𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 , wanes linearly to a log-viral load of VLswitch at 𝑎 = 𝑡𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ , and then wanes at a slower
333     linear rate until it reaches the limit of detection (LOD), a log-viral load of VLLOD at 𝑎 = 𝑡𝐿𝑂𝐷 . That
334     is, the mean log-viral load is given by:
                                                       𝑉𝐿𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 − 𝑉𝐿𝑧𝑒𝑟𝑜                              𝑉𝐿𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ − 𝑉𝐿𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘

337     The log-viral load is converted to a Ct value by: 𝐶𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 (𝑎) = 𝐶𝑡𝐿𝑂𝐷 − 𝑙𝑜𝑔2 (10) (𝑉𝐿𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 (𝑎) −
338     𝑉𝐿𝐿𝑂𝐷 ) where the limit of detection on the Ct scale is CtLOD = 40 and on the viral load scale is
339     VLLOD = 3. The Ct value at 𝑎 days after infection, 𝐶𝑡(𝑎), is then distributed according to 𝑝𝑎 (𝐶𝑡), a
340     Gumbel distribution with mean 𝐶𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 (𝑎) and variance 𝑆𝐷2 . This model captures the shape of
341     the observed mean viral load over time and the features described above. However, it
342     overestimates the proportion of infections that will be detectable three weeks or more after
343     infection. To account for this, each day after tswitch, we add an additional probability, paddl, that an
344     individual will clear the virus and become undetectable for that day forward, in addition to the
345     probability that the Ct value rises above the limit of detection. So the probability of being
346     detectable on day 𝑎 ≤ 𝑡𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ is 𝜙𝑎 = 𝑃[𝐶𝑡(𝑎) ≤ 𝐶𝑡𝐿𝑂𝐷 ] and the probability of being detectable on
347     day 𝑎 > 𝑡𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ is 𝜙𝑎 = 𝑃[𝐶𝑡(𝑎) ≤ 𝐶𝑡𝐿𝑂𝐷 ](1 − 𝑝𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑙 )𝑎−𝑡𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ .
348     We used a least-squares optimization framework to obtain parameter point estimates that gave
349     rise to viral kinetics with the following constraints: the proportion of individuals that are detectable
350     on each day post symptom onset declines in line with existing data (49), and the lower 99 th
351     percentile of possible Ct values is in line with the lowest observed Ct value in our Brigham &
352     Women’s Hospital dataset. We used these point estimates to derive informative priors on key
353     model parameters, as described in Table S1. The resulting distribution of Ct values and
354     detectable proportions at each day 𝑎 after infection are shown in Fig. S1. These parameters are
355     used as fixed parameters for the schematic (Fig. 1).
356     Likelihood for Parametric Model of Outbreak Trajectory
357     Given a known population-level Ct distribution for each day after infection and a known
358     detectable probability, 𝑝𝑎 (𝑥)and 𝜙𝑎 , respectively, we can determine the likelihood of the
359     probability of infection 𝑎 days prior to the test day, 𝜋𝑎 , for all 𝑎 with a positive probability of
360     detectable viral load, given the observed detectable viral loads 𝑥1 , . . . , 𝑥𝑛. Let {𝐴𝑚𝑖𝑛 , . . . , 𝐴𝑚𝑎𝑥 }
361     denote the days with a positive probability of detectable viral load, so that an individual with a
362     detectable viral load must have been infected between 𝐴𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝐴𝑚𝑖𝑛 days prior to testing. We
363     further assume that each individual’s viral load is independent of the viral load of other
364     individuals in the sample, conditional on the probability of infection for each day.
                                                      𝐴               𝑝𝑎 (𝑥𝑖 ) 𝜋𝑎
365     𝑃(𝑋𝑖 = 𝑥𝑖 |𝜋𝐴𝑚𝑖𝑛 , . . . , 𝜋𝐴𝑚𝑎𝑥 ) = ∑𝑎=𝐴      𝑚𝑎𝑥
                                                          𝑚𝑖𝑛       𝐴𝑚𝑎𝑥
                                                                                      .
                                                                  ∑𝑐=𝐴          𝜙𝑐 𝜋𝑐

366     Thus, the likelihood and log-likelihood, respectively, are given by:
                                                                                                                                           2

371     Assume that the outbreak, over the days prior to testing, is experiencing exponential growth or

378     More flexible parametric models can be used, including assuming piecewise exponential growth
379     or that the probability of infection on each day follows some other function. In these cases, the
380     parametric model for 𝜋𝑎 is simply used in place of 𝑒 −𝛽𝑎 in this likelihood and log-likelihood.
381     Additionally, nonparametric estimation can be performed by maximizing the likelihood in terms
382     of 𝜋𝑎 directly for 𝑎 ∈ {𝐴𝑚𝑖𝑛 , . . . , 𝐴𝑚𝑎𝑥 }. This approach, however, will likely give very high
383     variance unless there is a large sample size and the viral distribution has a small variance
384     compared to the trend in the mean over time.
385     Bayesian Framework for Estimation and Inference
386     To incorporate uncertainty in the distribution of viral loads on each day after infection, we
387     construct a Bayesian framework for estimation and inference. A prior distribution is specified for
388     𝛽(or the set of parameters used in the likelihood) as well as for the viral load distributions, 𝑝𝑎 (𝑥).
389     The prior for the viral load distributions can be specified in many ways, but we here
                                                                                                                                           3

390     parameterize these distributions by a mean and standard deviation for each day 𝑎 and assume
391     a normal distribution with those parameters, so the prior is specified on the mean and standard
392     deviation. This prior can be based on existing studies of viral load kinetics after infection and
393     can also take into account specific properties of the sample collection procedure, PCR
394     protocols, and machine used to analyze the samples, if known. Estimation and inference can
395     then proceed on the posterior distribution.
396     The prior distributions used here are listed in Table S1. The prior distribution for 𝛽 is taken to be
397     normal with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.1. Note that 𝛽 = 0.4 corresponds to a doubling
398     time of 1.73 days, so value of 𝛽 above 0.4 or below -0.4 would be highly unusual for SARS-
399     CoV-2.
400     To assess the outbreak trajectory, interest lies in the marginal posterior distribution of 𝛽. A
401     larger positive value of 𝛽indicates a faster-growing outbreak and a more negative value of
402     𝛽indicates a faster-waning outbreak. The posterior distribution of the 𝑝𝑎 (𝑥) parameters are
403     nuisance parameters for this goal, but may provide useful information for the prior distributions
404     of 𝑝𝑎 (𝑥) in future studies in similar settings.
405     Simulated Data
406     For Fig. 1, outbreaks are simulated according to a deterministic SEIR model with a population of
407     1,000,000 people, R0=2.5, average latent period of 6.41 days, and average infectiousness period
408     of 8.79 days. The latent and infectiousness periods are based on the best fit SEIR models for the
409     observed prevalences in Massachusetts nursing home data (not shown) and align fairly well with
410     the viral load kinetics implied by the Ct distribution model and with parameters reported elsewhere
411     (5, 50).
412     For Figs. 2 and 4, outbreaks are simulated according to a stochastic SEIR model with a population
413     of 6,900,000 people, an initial seed of 100 infected individuals, R0=2, average latent period of
414     6.41 days, and average infectiousness period of 8.79 days as above. We used the odin R package
415     for simulation (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/odin/index.html). To simulate cross-
416     sectional sampling, we assumed that 20% of the population was randomly sampled once during
417     the outbreak, which led to approximately 4,000 individuals being sampled and tested per day.
418     Each infected individual is then assigned an observed Ct value on the day of sampling using the
419     viral kinetics model described in Model for Population-Level Ct Distribution, with added
420     observation error drawn from a Gumbel distribution with a standard deviation of 6. Fig. S3 is
                                                                                                                                           4

421     generated in the same way, but with additional samples taken from symptomatic individuals. We
422     assumed that 35% of infections became symptomatic, and that symptomatic individuals had a
423     10% probability of being detected. Detected, symptomatic individuals were observed with some
424     delay post symptom onset drawn from a discretized gamma distribution with shape and rate
425     parameters of 5 and 2 respectively (mean and standard deviation of 2.5 and 1 days respectively).
426     Brigham & Women’s Hospital data, Boston, Massachusetts
427     Data comes from nasopharyngeal specimens processed on a Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-
428     CoV-2 assay for patients at the Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA. Testing during the
429     first two weeks in April 2020 were restricted to patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19
430     and who needed hospital admission. Following April 15, testing criteria were expanded to include
431     all hospital admissions regardless of symptoms and asymptomatic ER patients who were not
432     admitted. The results were from individuals entering the hospital for non-COVID procedures and
433     thus represent less biased surveillance specimens. Daily data is aggregated by week. Daily
434     confirmed case counts for Massachusetts were obtained from the NYT github page
435     (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) (51).
436     Estimating the effective reproductive number, R(t)
437     We          used            the           EpiNow2           R       package            for        all    R(t)         estimates
438     (https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2). The package estimates the time-varying reproduction
439     number                using                the           MCMC             package                 Stan         (https://cran.r-
440     project.org/web/packages/rstan/index.html), incorporating best practices in R(t) estimation as
441     described by Gostic et al. (52–54). The package takes a time series of confirmed case counts as
442     input, and returns posterior distribution estimates on the daily effective reproductive number.
443     EpiNow2 simultaneously infers R(t) and infection incidence using a method based on the Cori
444     method. We assumed that the confirmation delay distribution was log normally distributed with a
445     mean of 3 (on the linear scale) and standard deviation of 0.5 (on the log scale) days. We assumed
446     that the generation interval and incubation period were uncertain, using the default values
447     provided by the EpiNow2 package. The mean and standard deviation of the generation interval
448     were assumed to be 3.64 and 3.07 days respectively, with standard deviations for Bayesian priors
449     on these parameters of 0.711 and 0.770 respectively. The incubation period was assumed to be
450     log-normally distributed, with mean and standard deviation (both on the log scale) of 1.621 and
451     0.418 respectively, with standard deviations for Bayesian priors on these parameters of 0.064
                                                                                                                                           5

    Figure S2. Relationship between time since infection and detectable cycle threshold (Ct) distribution and
    growth rate. The median and skew of the time since infection distribution are directly related to growth rate.
    Although the time since infection distribution (blue lines indicate median, top, and skew, bottom, of time-
    since-infection) is not observed directly, Ct values can be used as a proxy observation model. The solid
    green line shows the observation model assumed for Fig. 1, whereas the faint green line shows how a
    relationship would still exist for an alternative observation model, the two differing, for example, by different
    tests in different labs. The test days shown in Fig. 1 are indicated by points. All results are based on an
    SEIR model in a population of 1,000,000 with R0 = 2.5, average latent period of 6.41 days, and average
    infectious period of 8.79 days, and Ct values are distributed according to the population-level Ct value
    distribution.

    Figure S3. Weekly distribution of positive (detectable) Ct values as in Fig. 2, but up to day 125 sampled
    individuals are a combination of randomly sampled cross-sections and individuals sampled in the days
    immediately after symptom onset, assuming that 35% of infections become symptomatic. The blue line
    shows the smoothed median from only cross-sectionally sampled individuals, whereas the purple line
    shows the smoothed median from combined cross-sectional and symptomatic sampled individuals. The
    violin plot shows densities of all sampled individuals. For these simulations, all symptomatic individuals had
    a 10% probability of being detected up to day 125. For detected individuals, we added a delay between
    symptom onset and sampling time drawn from a discretized gamma distribution with a mean of 2.5 days
    and standard deviation of 1 day.
