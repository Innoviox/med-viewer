    Abstract
    The vast majority of colleges and universities across the United
    States are bringing students back for in-person instruction in
    the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the absence of an
    effective vaccine or other anti-viral therapeutic treatment. Us-
    ing data from the New York Times and the American Community Sur-
    vey, we assess the effect of this return to campus on viral case
    growth in counties with a significant college student population
    (“college counties”) relative to non-college counties. We find a
    significant surge in new cases in a 21-day time frame in college
    counties, a finding consistent across U.S. Census divisions.
    These results suggest the need for institutions of higher educa-
    tion and the communities where these institutions reside work
    together quickly and effectively to mitigate viral transmission
    and to prevent overwhelming local healthcare infrastructure in
    college counties.

    Introduction
              In March of 2020, institutions of higher education across
    the United States pivoted abruptly to remote teaching in re-
    sponse to the COVID-19 pandemic1. These institutions complied
    with the shelter-in-place policies and public health guidance
    that sought to “flatten the curve,” and slow the speed of virus
    transmission.2
              Throughout the summer that followed, colleges and universi-
    ties nationwide began to formulate plans to reopen in the fall,
    or to remain closed to in-person student life and instruction.
    While the approaches taken by these postsecondary institutions
    to promote public health and safety have varied, the commonality
    shared across schools with any in-person instruction is the sig-
    nificant influx of students to the communities where these in-
    stitutions are located.
              According to the most recent data tracked by Davidson Col-
    lege’s College Crisis Initiative, only 191 of 2,958 colleges and
    universities are fully online for fall semester 2020.3 This means
    that the vast majority of U.S. institutions of higher education
    are bringing students back to campus in some way, and that this
    fall’s return to campus is occurring without a vaccine to pre-
    vent or effective therapeutic to treat the Sars-CoV-2 virus.
              This return to campus in the midst of an ongoing global
    pandemic brings together a disease that spreads rapidly through
                                                                                                                                        3

    respiratory droplets and a population that is prone to spending
    substantial time in large groups, especially at bars and par-
    ties, which are high risk scenarios for COVID-19 transmission.4,5
    Indeed, despite the best laid plans for a “safe” return to cam-
    pus, already some institutions of higher education are ceasing
    or substantially decreasing in-person activities and pivoting
    back to remote instruction. Others soldier on, despite alarming
    increases in cases among the study body and surrounding communi-
    ty.
              Our goal in this data analysis is to describe the initial
    return to campus rise in COVID-19 cases in college counties
    across the United States during late August and early September
    2020. We present a novel measure of the “return to campus
    COVID19 new case rate” and provide descriptive evidence of how
    and where outbreaks are emerging in college counties. We esti-
    mate that counties where 10 percent or more of the population is
    enrolled in college experience a 9 percent increase in the new
    COVID19 case rate during the return to campus period as compared
    to other counties. This significant rise in COVID19 case rates
    associated with the return of college students to college towns
    has substantial implications for public health, especially in
    rural communities with already strained healthcare in-
    frastructure and worrisome health disparities.

    Study Data & Methods
              Our data come from two publicly available sources. Census
    divisions, the percent of the population aged 18 to 24, and to-
    tal county population data come from the U.S. Census Bureau.6
    COVID19 case counts and deaths come from the New York Times
    COVID19 database.7 COVID-19 case data are available at the coun-
    ty-day level, which is the unit of analysis. The observation
    time frame extends retrospectively, twelve weeks from the most
    recent case reporting available at the time of our writing, from
    June 14 through September 6, 2020. The county day sample size is
    3,118 records.
              The main outcome of interest is what we term the new case
    rate, where the number of new cases in the last three weeks pri-
    or to September 6 (August 16) was divided by the cases in the
    twelve weeks prior to this date (June 14). To produce a compara-
    ble scale with the main variable of interest (percentage college
    students), this ratio is multiplied by 100. If cases were dis-
    tributed evenly, we would expect a rate of 25%, as three weeks
    is one-quarter of the twelve-week study period. A higher number
    would thus indicate a surge of new cases, while a lower one
    would indicate a tapering off of cases.
              The independent variable of interest is a dichotomous indi-
    cator of whether the county is defined as a “college county.” To
                                                                                                                                        5

    operationalize this hypothesis, we use data from the 2014-18
    American Community Survey showing the number of individuals ages
    18 to 24 currently enrolled in public college or graduate
    school. We rely on the New York Times decision rule of assigning
    a value of “1” to a county if at least 10% of the county’s total
    population is comprised of college students ages 18-24 (n=135);
    counties that do not meet this criterion are assigned a “0” val-
    ue (n=2,983). In addition to the new case rate and the college
    county indicator, we use the geographic areas defined as the
    nine U.S. Census divisions to control for regional variation. We
    also control for total county population.
              We estimated descriptive statistics for all variables and
    include those in Exhibit 2. We then estimated a regression model
    using the return to campus new case rate as the outcome of in-
    terest. As a sensitivity analysis, we also estimated an alterna-
    tive outcome using a rate that is the return to campus new cases
    (the most recent 21 days) divided by total cases since the be-
    ginning of the pandemic. We also created a linear model for just
    college counties including the percentage of college students
    along with census division and total population. All estimates
    were conducted using R v.3.6.0.

    Study Results
              Descriptively, the new case rate varies notably within most
    census divisions, as shown in Exhibits 1, 2, and 3. In all but
    the Mountain Division, college counties have median rates higher
    than other counties. As Exhibit 2 shows, those differences range
    from 3.4% in the Pacific Division to 18.9% in the West North
    Central Division. The median new case rate is higher than 25%
    for college counties in all divisions except the Pacific and
    Mountain Divisions, indicating a surge in recent cases, with a
    maximum value of 54.6% in the West North Central Division. This
    may be partly due to a high new case rate for non-college coun-
    ties (36%). Yet as the boxplots illustrate, this is only slight-
    ly higher than the neighboring East North Central Division
    (33%). In that division, new case rates for college counties are
    only 37%, 18% lower than in the West North Central Division.
              Exhibit 1 visualizes this through a map of county rates,
    with college counties highlighted as circles. The dark colors
    for many counties in the East and West North Central Divisions
    show the general surge of cases there, but almost all college
    counties have values at the high end of the classification
    range. In the East South Central and South Atlantic Divisions,
    new case rates are lower, but the college counties in these ar-
    eas are still high relative to non-college counties.
                                                                                                                                        7

              The total population of college counties is consistently
    higher than non-college counties, with the only exception being
    the Middle Atlantic Division. This is largely due to the rural
    nature of most counties nationally. The median percentage of
    college students ranges from 1.7% to 2.4% in non-college coun-
    ties. Lastly, college counties are most numerous in the West
    North Central and South Atlantic Divisions (25 in each) and
    least numerous in New England (4), though the rate in the latter
    (6% of 67 total counties) is higher than in the former (4% in
    each).

    Case Rate Change by Census Division here.]
    [Exhibit 3: Table of Descriptive Statistics here.]
              The results of our primary model (model 1, shown in Exhibit
    4) indicate that college counties have a significant, positive
    association with higher new case rates, one that is 9.2% higher
    than other counties in their divisions, controlling for popula-
    tion size. This coefficient is slightly smaller (8.5%) in model
    2, where the new case rate uses all reported cases as a baseline
    rather than the last 12 weeks.
              The coefficient for total population is negative in both
    these models, which indicates that the new case rate is higher
    in counties with smaller population. The magnitude and direction

    of this coefficient is similar (-0.39, significant) even when
    the college county variable is removed. The control variables
    for division are significant in both models 1 and 2 in the West
    and East North Central, East South Central, and Middle Atlantic
    Divisions (the Pacific Division is used as a reference). These
    coefficients are mostly positive, as both Exhibits 1 and 2 show
    recent surges in the first three divisions. The R2 shows a modest
    fit (0.153) for these models.
              When considering just college counties (model 3), model fit
    is much stronger (R2=0.346), as many counties with high rates but
    few college students have been removed. The coefficient for the
    rate of college students is positive and significant (0.97), in-
    dicating that new case rates increase approximately 1% for each
    additional 1% of college students in the population. Thus, case
    surges in college counties are greater in towns with a greater
    percentage of students.

    Discussion
              We find support for the hypothesis that the return to col-
    lege and university campuses across the United States is associ-
    ated with significant increases in county-level new case rates,
                                                                                                                                        9

    controlling for the county population and Census division. Col-
    lege counties (those with >10% of their population enrolled in
    colleges or universities) show significant increases in new case
    growth relative to counties not in this category. These findings
    serve as preliminary evidence of the effect of in-person return
    to college campuses on COVID19 viral transmission in the coun-
    ties where these postsecondary institutions are located.
              Our response to the pandemic as a society has rapidly
    evolved from full-scale lockdown in the first wave of infec-
    tions, to a fully reopened economy during the summer that has
    remained open despite new waves of infections. In the beginning
    of the pandemic in the United States, many local and state ju-
    risdictions adopted and implemented shelter-in-place (SIP) poli-
    cies. These policies required that individuals stay at home un-
    less conducting essential tasks (such as grocery shopping or
    picking up prescriptions) or performing essential work functions
    (such as healthcare provision).
              During this time period, which spanned from mid-March to
    late April, over 94% of the American population was under a SIP
    order.8 The SIP policies and the weeks that followed their imple-
    mentation meant that most individuals were socially isolated,
    with implications for individuals and households in experiencing
    increased loneliness and decreases in mental wellbeing.9,10 This
                                                                                                                                      10

    also applied to students in the postsecondary education popula-
    tion. Colleges and universities shut down in-person operations
    and moved classes to virtual delivery.
              After months of SIP policies, followed by a mixed landscape
    of less formal recommendations at state and local levels to
    maintain social distancing standards and to avoid large groups,
    colleges and universities have brought millions of students back
    to campuses across the country. The students could have a sig-
    nificant pent-up demand for social engagement and a desire for a
    return to normalcy, despite the persistence of the pandemic.
    Preliminary evidence of the effects of the pandemic and SIP
    policies show that “quarantine fatigue” was evident as early as
    mid-April.11 By the fall 2020 return to campus, quarantine and
    pandemic fatigue are likely much worse.
              The success of limiting viral transmission rests on our
    ability and willingness as a society to comply with public
    health mitigation efforts, included but not limited to consis-
    tent mask wearing, social distancing, avoiding large groups (es-
    pecially indoors), access to testing with timely results, com-
    pliance with contact tracing, and quarantine and isolation when
    exposed or testing positive. Policies within institutions/sys-

    leverage incentives for compliance accordingly.12,13 As many are
    now discovering, simply cajoling young people to stay home and
    not spend significant time with their peers is ineffectual and
    developmentally inappropriate.
    Limitations
              Interpretation of our findings requires some caution.
    First, we would expect that part of the case increase in coun-
    ties with institutions of higher education is simply a direct
    function of the population of those counties increasing with the
    return to campus. Second, there is significant variation in lo-
    cal and state-level policy response to the pandemic that is a
    potential source of omitted variable bias in our analysis.
    Third, post-secondary institutions are taking myriad approaches
    to their return to campus.
              The work of Chris Marsicano and colleagues have documented
    the various approaches to this policy landscape. These range
    from full scale returns to campus with in-person instructions,
    to hybrid models combining the return to in-person combined with
    virtual learning, to completely moving instructions and univer-
    sity operations online for the duration of the 2020-2021 academ-
    ic year.14 We are unable to account for the nuances of the varia-
    tion in instructional model, in addition to the various ap-
                                                                                                                                      12

    other pandemic mitigation strategies.
    Conclusion
              Our analysis reveals a strong association between student
    return to campus and new case growth, specifically in “college
    counties” in the United States. For these counties, where at
    least 10% of the county population is comprised of college stu-
    dents, we see an average increase of 9% in the new case rate
    relative to non-college counties. These findings are consistent
    across the country at the U.S. Census Division level, with the
    Mountain Division as the only exception.
              Return to campus case rates grow significantly in college
    counties when controlling for both the county population and the
    college or university population, and the findings are robust
    whether we estimate the models across the total pandemic obser-
    vation period and the 60 days prior to campus return. These
    findings suggest that despite the efforts of colleges and uni-
    versities to prepare for a safe return to campus, virus trans-
    mission has persisted among college students and is rapidly
    evolving in ways that has already created new “hot spots.” The
    science on COVID19                          transmission is still developing, but thus
    far it has been established that the spread is a function of
                                                                                                                                      13

    respiratory droplets from infected persons coming into contact
    with non-infected persons.
              Given this reality, colleges and universities and the com-
    munities in which they are embedded must act quickly to inter-
    vene to slow the transmission before seasonal change and colder
    weather brings flu season. While it is expensive for postsec-
    ondary institutions to pivot and forgone revenue will come with
    its own host of consequences for both these institutions and the
    counties where they are located, COVID-19 transmission has al-
    ready reached levels that could lead to overwhelm the healthcare
    systems of these college counties. Prioritizing public health
    demands that until effective vaccines or other anti-viral thera-
    peutics are developed, policy approaches of postsecondary insti-
    tutions and local county governments will have to become more
    collaborative and aggressive to control viral transmission.
