       Abstract

       Respiratory disease is common in children and strongly associated with lifestyle and

       environmental exposures. Thus, it is important to study the epidemiology locally.

       LuftiBus in the school (LUIS) was set up to assess the respiratory health of

       schoolchildren in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland.



       LUIS is a cross-sectional population-based study that was carried-out 2013 to 2016.

       Children aged 6-17 years living in the canton of Zurich were eligible to participate. All

       schools in the canton were approached and the school head decided whether the

       school would participate and with which classes. Consenting parents answered a

       standardized questionnaire at home and assenting children completed a shorter

       questionnaire by interview at school. Trained technicians measured children’s lung

       function including spirometry, double tracer gas single-breath washout (DTG-SBW) and

       fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). Address histories of participants were geocoded

       and can be linked with area-based socioeconomic measures and environmental

       exposures including spatiotemporal air pollution estimates for specific time periods

       and locations. A subgroup was seen again 12 months later using the same procedures

       to collect longitudinal data.



       The study included 3879 children at baseline and 646 at the one-year follow-up.

       Median age was 12.7 years; 281 (8%) had wheezed in the past year. At baseline we

       collected 3466 (89%) parental and 3555 (92%) children’s questionnaires, and 3402

       (88%) FeNO, 3478 (90%) spirometry, and 2251 (58%) DTG-SBW measurements.

       LUIS is a rich resource of health-related data, with information on lung function,

       environmental exposures and respiratory health on Swiss schoolchildren.




       Introduction

       Respiratory disease is common, and can affect quality of life and school performance

       in children [1]. Symptoms and diseases result from complex interactions between

       genetic factors and modifiable behavioural and environmental influences such as

       physical activity, passive and active smoking and air pollution [2]. The prevalence of

       respiratory symptoms such as wheeze and cough varies widely between countries, so

       local studies are important [3, 4]. Geographic differences in prevalence of respiratory

       diseases may result from differences in lifestyle, health care, socioeconomic factors,

       and environmental exposures [5].



       Previous research on the respiratory health of Swiss children focused on lower

       respiratory symptoms and farming environment [6-12]. There are no recent studies

       and none that includes detailed lung function testing. Different lung function tests

       measure diverse aspects of lung physiology. Joint evaluation of different tests’ results

       is useful to understand the underlying mechanisms that cause respiratory symptoms in

       children. The objectives of LUIS are to assess frequency and risk factors of respiratory

       symptoms and diagnoses and to study associations between symptoms, different lung

       function assessments and environmental exposures. This article explains the

       methodology of LUIS and presents first results.

       Methods

       Study design and setting

       Throughout the manuscript we use past tense for procedures or analyses that were

       done in the past and use present or future tense for those that are underway or

       planned. LUIS is a cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2013 to

       December 2016 among schoolchildren aged 6 to 17 years living in the canton of Zurich

       (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03659838). A subsample of children was seen again one year

       later for collection of longitudinal data. The canton of Zurich is located in the north-

       eastern part of Switzerland and is the most populated canton in the country with over

       1.5 million inhabitants, an 18% of the Swiss population [13].




       Study procedures

       LUIS was embedded in a respiratory health promotion activity offered by Lunge Zürich

       [14-16]. Lunge Zürich is a non-profit organization that promotes respiratory health

       prevention and research [14]. LUIS used a special bus from Lunge Zürich, the LuftiBus,

       to visit schools within the canton of Zurich, further details on the LuftiBus are

       described in the online material [14]. Schools contributed 500CHF for a two-day visit

       and 800CHF for a visit lasting one week, from their reserved budget for health

       prevention activities in schools. All school heads in the canton of Zurich were invited to

       participate (Figure 1). They decided whether to take part in the project, and with

       which classes. The study coordinator provided the schools with closed envelopes

       containing study information for parents and for children, an informed consent form

       and a questionnaire for parents. Teachers gave these envelopes to the students two

       weeks before the visit. Parents were asked to complete the questionnaire. Two study

                                                                                                                            4

       field workers, who were trained lung function technicians, visited each school for a

       median of three days with the study bus, the LuftiBus [14]. They collected the parental

       questionnaires and consent forms from the teachers and asked all students for oral

       and where appropriate written consent. The study bus contained computers and

       equipment for lung function testing. One field worker measured the children’s height

       and weight and performed the lung function tests, while the other interviewed the

       children using a short electronic questionnaire.

       Where the heads of the participating schools agreed, the school was visited again one

       year later (2015-2016) following the same procedures and performing the same tests

       as in the baseline visit.




       Data collection

       The questionnaires

       The study used two questionnaires: one for parents and one for children. Both

       included questions on respiratory symptoms and diagnoses including the key questions

       from the International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Childhood study and

       additional questions from the Leicester Respiratory Cohort questionnaires [3, 17]. The

       questionnaire to parents included questions about frequency, duration, severity, and

       triggers of upper and lower respiratory symptoms, doctors’ diagnosis of asthma,

       medication, environmental factors, household characteristics, family history of

       asthma, and current and past addresses (Table 1). We geocoded participant’s

       addresses using a reference file from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (Neuchâtel)

       [13]. The data from the parental questionnaire was entered into an Epidata database




                                                                                                                            5

       Preventive Medicine (ISPM) in Bern.

       Children replied to the questionnaire via interview by the field workers in the bus. It

       included questions about current respiratory health such as rhinitis, cough and

       wheeze, the presence of cough or a cold on the day of the school visit, inhaled or oral

       asthma medication on the day of the visit, active smoking, and parental smoking. To

       help the children correctly report asthma medications, the field workers used a poster

       with pictures and commercial names of all commonly used inhaled and oral

       medications in Switzerland (online Figure S1). Children’s answers were directly entered

       by field workers into the web-based Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)

       database [18].



       Area-based index of socioeconomic position in Switzerland (Swiss-SEP)

       The Swiss-SEP has been developed by the Swiss National Cohort (SNC) as an area-

       based measure of socioeconomic status that incorporates information on rent per

       square meter, education and occupation of households’ heads, and number of persons

       per household room [19, 20]. The Swiss-SEP ranges from 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest).

       We estimated the Swiss-SEP for our participants by matching the geocodes of our

       participants addresses to the nearest geocode in the Swiss-SEP dataset. If the address

       of a participant was missing, we assigned the median Swiss-SEP among participants of

       the same school. In this manuscript we used a dataset from the SNC to assess the

       distribution of Swiss-SEP among households from the canton of Zurich with at least

       one child in school-age (6-17 years) and compared it to the distribution of Swiss-SEP of

       our study participants.

       Lung function measurements

       Children’s standing height and weight were measured without shoes and recorded in

       the spirometry database. Lung function tests were performed to children inside the

       bus in the following order: 1) double tracer gas single-breath washout (DTG-SBW), 2)

       fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and 3) spirometry.

       DTG-SBW

       DTG-SBW was performed using a validated and commercially available setup

       (Exhalyzer D®, Eco Medics AG, Duernten, Switzerland) [21]. The patient interface

       consisted of a bacterial filter and a snorkel mouthpiece to prevent air leaks near the

       mouth. According to current paediatric equipment recommendations, a dead space

       reducer and a disposable hygienic insert provided by the manufacturer were used [22].

       The DTG mixture contained 26.3% helium (He), 5% sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), 21%

       oxygen (O2), and balance dinitrogen (N2) from pressurized cylinders (Carbagas, Bern,

       Switzerland). Children were watching a video for distraction while breathing through

       an open bypass system. Directly before tracer gas wash-in, the apparatus dead space

       and the bias flow was flushed with double-tracer gas or 100% O2 during expiration to

       prevent re-inspiration of expired or ambient gas [23]. DTG-SBW was performed in

       accordance to the European Respiratory Society (ERS) consensus on inert gas washout

       testing [22]: after establishing natural tidal breathing for at least 5 breaths monitored

       by online flow-volume loops and tidal volumes varying less than 10%, the system was

       flushed with the DTG mixture. Within only one breath, the children inhaled the double-

       tracer gas and exhaled it back. SBW tests were done in triplicate. After each test, at

       least 10 breaths at room air followed until the online monitoring of the gas signals

                                                                                                                            7

       returned to baseline [22]. Primary outcome of the DTG-SBW was the mean slope from

       the tidal (alveolar) phase III from three technically acceptable DTG-SBW curves,

       normalized for tidal volume (SnIII) [24]. The magnitude of phase III slopes from He and

       SF6 relates to acinar branching asymmetry and small airways obstruction [25]. DTG-

       SBW is a fast and easy to perform test with low variability and high repeatability [21].

       FeNO

       FeNO was measured with a single breath on-line method according to

       recommendations [26]. We used a fast response chemiluminescence analyser CLD 88,

       Eco Medics AG, Duernten, Switzerland. The field workers calibrated the FeNO device

       every morning and the gas was calibrated once per month. Children breathed air free

       of nitric oxide via the Denox system (EcoMedics, Dürnten). This setup also included a

       bacterial filter and disposable hygienic mouthpiece. After ten breaths, children exhaled

       against an adjusted expiratory resistance with a constant target flow of 50ml/sec for at

       least at least 4 seconds for children younger than 12 years and 6 seconds for children

       aged 12 years or older. We aimed for at least two reproducible exhalations with the

       nitric oxide plateau values within 10% of each other. Results were stored digitally,

       including information on FeNO (parts per billion, ppb), expiratory time (seconds),

       duration of the plateau (seconds), and average flow in the plateau (ml/s). The primary

       outcome was FeNO.

       Spirometry

       Spirometry was performed using Masterlab, Jaeger, Würzburg, Germany according to

       American Thoracic Society (ATS) / ERS recommendations [27]. The children performed

       3 to 5 forced expiratory manoeuvres. Spirometry parameters were recorded and

       stored digitally using the Sentry Suite software, Carefusion, Hoechberg Germany.

                                                                                                                            8

       Spirometry parameters included forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume

       in the first second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), FEV1/FVC ratio, maximum

       expiratory flow at 75%, 50% and at 25% FVC (FEF75, FEF50, FEF25) and between the 25

       and 75% of FVC (FEF25–75). The spirometry flow-volume curve of the best effort was

       printed on paper. Primary outcomes were forced expiratory flows and volumes.

       Absolute values of spirometry parameters were expressed as z-scores according to

       Global Lung Initiative reference values [28].




       Air pollution assessment

       Spatiotemporal data on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter with an

       aerodynamic diameter of 2.5µm or less (PM2.5) will be obtained from models

       developed by de Hoogh et al. [29, 30]. Daily average NO2 concentrations were

       modelled across Switzerland using a multistage framework with mixed-effect and

       random forest models at a fine spatial resolution of 100x100m [29] combining the

       Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) NO2 product with Copernicus Atmosphere

       Monitoring Service (CAMS), land use and meteorological variables. Daily PM2.5

       concentrations across Switzerland were estimated first by a combination of a mixed

       effect model and a generalised additive mixed model at a 1×1km resolution using

       Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC), spectral aerosol

       optical depth (AOD) data, and second by support vector machine algorithms used to

       predict precise exposure estimates at a 100x100m resolution using with

       spatiotemporal predictor data [30]. These air pollution models allow to estimate

       participants’ average exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 for specific time windows and

       Ethics and data safety

       The ethics committee of the canton of Zurich approved the study (KEK-ZH-Nr: 2014-

       0491). Parents signed the informed consent and completed a detailed questionnaire.

       Children assented orally and those aged 15 years or older did also sign. Participant

       identifiable information was stored in a separate database and only

       pseudoanonymized datasets are used for analysis. Paper-based data were securely

       locked at ISPM and only accessible to the study team. Raw data of DTG-SBW, FeNO

       and spirometry measurements were stored in a safe study server during recruitment

       and were thereafter encrypted and securely stored in the ISPM protected server.

       Access to the server and the study databases is restricted to members of the study

       team. Study datasets are securely stored and routinely backed-up in protected servers

       of ISPM Bern. Study collaborators and other researchers can obtain datasets for

       analysis if a detailed concept sheet is presented for the planned analyses and

       approved by the principal investigators (AM, PL and CK).




       Data preparation and analysis

       We calculated body mass index (BMI) z-scores according to Swiss population

       references [31]. We categorised BMI z-scores ≥2 as obesity, ≥1 to <2 as overweight and

       ≤-2 as underweight, according to the WHO classification [33]. In this manuscript we

       compared participants’ characteristics between age groups using P values for a trend.

       We used the software STATA (Version 16.1, StataCorp., College Station, TX) for

       statistical analysis. Confounders will be selected a priori in our planned analyses based

       on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Details on data quality assessments are in the

                                                                                                                          11

       Results

       Participating schools

       All 490 schools in the canton of Zurich were invited to participate (online Table S1). At

       baseline 37 schools took part and 3879 participants consented. One year later, 19

       schools were visited a second time and 646 children were followed-up. The canton of

       Zurich (Figure 2) has mostly schools in small (47%) and large urban areas (41%) and

       fewer in rural areas (12%) (Figure 3, online Table S1) [35, 36]. At baseline, LUIS visited

       18 schools in small (49%) and 15 in large (41%) urban areas and 4 in rural areas (11%),

       13 schools in small (68%) and 4 in large (21%) urban areas and 2 in rural areas (11%)

       were revisited. Median Swiss-SEP was 66.2 (interquartile range, IQR: 58.2-73.0) for

       households with at least one school-aged child in the canton of Zurich and 69.3 (IQR:

       61.4-76.3) for LUIS participants at baseline and 69.4 (IQR: 64.6-74.8) at follow-up

       (Figure 4, Figure S2).




       Completeness of datasets

       At baseline 3466 participants provided parental questionnaires, 3555 answered the

       children’s questionnaire, 3455 did spirometry and 3402 FeNO tests (Table 2). Data

       from all four datasets is available for 2655 at baseline and 526 at follow-up. DTG-SBW

       data is available for 2251 children at baseline and 461 at follow-up.



                                                                                                                          12

       Characteristics of the study population

       LUIS included 989 children aged 6-9 years (25%), 1728 aged 10-13 years (45%) and

       1162 aged 14-17 years (30%) at baseline (Table 3). Current wheeze was reported by

       parents of 281 (8%) children. Exercise induced wheeze was more common among

       older children, and night cough among younger children. Use of inhaled short acting

       beta two agonists (SABA) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in the past year was reported

       by parents of 257 (8%) and 179 (5%) children respectively. Parents of 1110 (32%)

       reported that their child was very physically activity level. This was more common for

       younger children. Mothers of 575 (17%) and fathers of 761 (22%) children reported to

       smoke. BMI z-score was between 1 and 2 z-scores in 575 of the children (18%) and ≥ 2

       in 191 (6%), more older than younger children were obese.

       Discussion

       LUIS is a large school-based study performed 2013-2016 in the canton of Zurich,

       Switzerland which comprised a thorough assessment of respiratory symptoms, lung

       function, lifestyle and environmental exposures.




       Strengths and weaknesses

       The main strength of LUIS is the wealth of health data that were collected, which

       includes three different lung function tests: spirometry, FeNO measured using high

       resolution equipment, and the novel DTG-SBW. This permits the investigation of

       different physiological aspects of lung health. A subsample of participants repeated

       lung function measurements a year later, which allows to assess lung growth. We

       collected detailed questionnaire data on respiratory symptoms, diagnoses and lifestyle

       both from parents and from children, which allows comparisons between their

       answers. Information was collected on lower respiratory symptoms like wheeze, and

       chronic cough and on upper respiratory symptoms such as rhinitis, hay fever and

       snoring. Respiratory symptoms are influenced by seasonality but the LuftiBus visited

       the schools throughout different seasons, which gives the possibility to take

       seasonality into account in our analysis. Participants’ address histories, enable us to

       use state-of-the-art methods [29, 30] to estimate air pollution exposure during specific

       time windows.



       The main weakness is that it was not a perfectly random sample of schoolchildren.

       Participation was decided by the heads of the schools, and classes were recruited as a

       whole. We do not have individual data on non-participating students, which limits the

                                                                                                                          15

       possibilities to assess representativeness of the sampled population. However, the

       distribution of participating schools in rural and urban areas at baseline was similar to

       the average distribution of schools in the canton of Zurich. At follow-up, schools from

       small urban areas were slightly overrepresented in our study. The cost associated to

       the health promotion activity in which the LUIS study was embedded was covered by

       the public budget for health prevention activities available to school heads. The area-

       based socioeconomic index of participating families was roughly comparable to that of

       all households with school-aged children from the canton of Zurich. Thus, we think

       LUIS gives a fair picture of the school-aged population from the canton of Zurich.

       Another limitation is the lack of objective measurements of atopy such as skin prick

       tests or serum IgE levels. This limits the interpretation of FeNO data. We had however,

       proxy measures of atopy i.e. reported hay fever and atopic dermatitis.




       Outlook

       LUIS will cover knowledge gaps on children’s respiratory health. This dataset allows to

       determine prevalence of upper and lower respiratory symptoms, to describe lifestyle

       characteristics like physical activity and smoking [37], and to study associations with

       lung function. We are able to use information from both parents and children and

       several lung function tests including markers of ventilatory function (spirometry),

       ventilation inhomogeneity (DTG-SBW) and Th2 airway inflammation (FeNO), to answer

       research questions in a comprehensive way [32, 38]. For example, DTG-SBW data

       allows to detect even subtle changes in peripheral airways, that may not be identified

       by spirometry alone [38]. The broad set of data collected allows us to describe lung




                                                                                                                          16

       function in healthy children, and to report normal values. The LUIS study makes it also

       possible to study effects of air pollution on respiratory symptoms and lung function.

       In conclusion, LuftiBus in the school (LUIS) provides a unique opportunity to assess the

       respiratory health in Swiss schoolchildren, and its association with health behaviours

       and air pollution. Better understanding of factors that influence Swiss schoolchildren’s

       respiratory health may help to establish new recommendations and influence policy

       makers’ decisions.
