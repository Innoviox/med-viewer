14 Summary
15 COVID-19 is associated with a wide spectrum of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic to acute
16 respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Paradoxically, a direct relationship has been suggested
17 between COVID-19 disease severity, and the levels of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies,
18 including virus neutralizing titers. Through a serological analysis of serum samples from 536
19 convalescent healthcare workers, we found that SARS-CoV-2-specific and virus-neutralizing antibody
20 levels were indeed elevated in individuals that experienced severe disease. The severity-associated
21 increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody was dominated by IgG, with an IgG subclass ratio skewed
22 towards elevated receptor binding domain (RBD)- and S1-specific IgG3. However, RBD- and S1-
23 specific IgG1, rather than IgG3 were best correlated with virus-neutralizing titers. We propose that
24 Spike-specific IgG3 subclass utilization contributes to COVID-19 disease severity through
25 potent Fc-mediated effector functions. These results have significant implications for SARS-CoV-2
26 vaccine design, and convalescent plasma therapy.

27 Introduction
28 The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the
29 causative agent of COVID-19, a disease responsible for more 1 million deaths in just a matter of
30 months. The case incidence based on virus detection estimates 35 million cases globally to date.
31 However, if population-based serological surveys of SARS-CoV-2 are taken into account, the infection
32 rate of SARS-CoV-2 is likely much higher (McLaughlin et al., 2020; Pollan et al., 2020). This
33 discrepancy highlights the variability of COVID-19 disease presentation in the human population. The
34 severity of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from an asymptomatic presentation, to
35 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death. Risk factors such as age, gender, and
36 underlying disease are known to be associated with COVID-19 disease severity; however, a subset of
37 patients with severe disease are younger without obvious comorbidities. The immunological features
38 associated with severe COVID-19 disease include high levels of inflammatory cytokines, low
39 lymphocyte counts, high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios, and increased serum proteins such as C-
40 reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and D-dimer (Chen et al., 2020a; Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020;
41 Kuri-Cervantes et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020). In addition, several studies have shown that SARS-
42 CoV-2-specific antibody and neutralizing titers are increased in patients who exhibit more severe
43 disease (Long et al., 2020; Piccoli et al., 2020). Therefore, it is important to consider that SARS-CoV-2
44 specific antibodies may play multiple roles in COVID-19 pathogenesis, including control of viral
45 infection, disease resolution, and immunopathology.
46 The humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 is primarily directed towards the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and
47 the spike protein that decorates the surface of the virus. The N protein is an RNA binding protein
48 composed of an N-terminal RNA binding domain, and a C-terminal oligomerization domain that are
49 essential for viral RNA transcription and replication (Kang et al., 2020). The spike protein is a multi-
50 domain trimeric glycoprotein composed of two distinct subunits. The S1 subunit is composed of four
51 domains, including the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein (Wrapp et al., 2020).
                                                                           3

52 The S2 domain forms the stalk-like portion of the full-length trimeric protein and is responsible for viral
53 fusion with the host cell membrane. Antibody responses directed at the spike protein and RBD in
54 particular, have been identified as the main neutralizing component of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody
55 response (Chen et al., 2020b; Robbiani et al., 2020; Suthar et al., 2020). A recent study found that
56 distinct antibody signatures could be linked to different COVID-19 disease outcomes. Specifically, early
57 spike-specific responses were associated with a positive outcome (convalescence), while early N-
58 specific responses were associated with a negative outcome (death). Moreover, the Fc-associated
59 functions of the antibody response such as antibody-mediated phagocytosis, cytotoxicity, and
60 complement deposition were critical for disease resolution (Atyeo et al., 2020). However, little is known
61 about antibody isotypes and subclasses generated in response to SARS-CoV-2, or their role in COVID-
62 19 pathogenesis. In this study, we analyzed the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a unique
63 cohort of 536 convalescent healthcare workers that were stratified by COVID-19 disease severity. This
64 cohort provided us with a unique snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody profile at
65 convalescence, as a window to previous disease pathogenesis. We found a significantly increased
66 SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody response in severe COVID-19 patients when compared to patients who
67 experienced mild and moderate disease symptoms. This severity-associated antibody increase was
68 dominated by IgG, with a disproportionate IgG subclass response dominated by IgG3.

69 Results
70 Study Cohort
71 A total of 536 COVID-19 serum specimens from convalescent healthcare workers (HCW) were
72 received by the Wadsworth Center for SARS-CoV-2 serology testing. The sera were obtained from
73 individuals who had tested positive by RT-PCR and had illness consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
74 Table 1 provides basic patient demographic information stratified by self-reported COVID-19 disease
75 severity. The gender distribution of the study cohort was bias towards females (29% male, 69% female,
76 with 2% gender unknown) reflecting the gender disparity within the HCW. The mean age and days
77 post-onset of symptoms (DPO) was roughly the same in all gender categories. Approximately 10% of
78 the study cohort experienced severe disease, 40% moderate disease, 40% mild disease, with 10%
79 uncharacterized disease. The average age of each group in our cohort increased with disease severity,
80 as did the percentage of males within each group. In fact, the representation of males (65%) in the
81 severe group was more than double that of the mild group (31%), illustrating a clear gender bias in
82 COVID-19 disease severity.
83 Relationship of Antibody Production and Virus Neutralization Capability with COVID-19 Disease
84 Severity
85 A total of 536 serum samples were assessed for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using a clinical
86 microsphere immunoassay (MIA) to detect total antibody directed against N protein or RBD of SARS-
87 CoV-2. We used the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of PE-labeled anti-human Ig to antigen-
88 coupled beads as a qualitative measure of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody abundance in donor serum.
89 We found that total serum antibody specific to the N protein, and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 were increased
90 with increasing disease severity (Table 1; Figure 1a). To evaluate the relationship between overall
91 antibody levels and protective antibody we measured viral neutralization using a plaque reduction
92 neutralization test (PRNT) where the highest dilution of sera providing 50% (PRNT50) or 90%
                                                                           5

 93 (PRNT90) viral plaque reduction relative to a virus only control was reported as the neutralizing titer.
 94 Both PRNT50 and PRNT90 measurements identified a concomitant increase in virus neutralizing titers
 95 with disease severity (Figure 1b). RBD-specific responses were strongly correlated with virus
 96 neutralization, as revealed through a Spearman’s correlation analysis with PRNT90 values and MFI
 97 values. The correlation with PRNT90 titers was greater for RBD-specific Ig than N-specific Ig (r = 0.68
 98 and 0.53, respectively)(Figure 1c). Since the function of the RBD is host cell attachment through ACE-
 99 2 binding, our data suggests that the neutralization activity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in our
100 PRNT assay is primarily based on the ability to block viral attachment and uptake by host cells (Chen et
101 al., 2020b; Robbiani et al., 2020; Suthar et al., 2020).
102 Isotype and Antigen Distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 specific Antibody Profile Across COVID-19
103 Disease Severities
104 To better resolve the SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune response across COVID-19 severity groups, we
105 tested additional antibody isotypes and specificities in our clinical MIA assay. Positive antibody
106 reactivity was defined as 6 standard deviations above the mean MFI, as determined by a panel of 93
107 pre-COVID-19 normal human serum specimens tested against each antibody isotype/antigen
108 combination. Index value measurements were calculated by dividing the MFI by the previously
109 determined cutoff MFI. In addition to N and RBD, we included the S1 and S2 sub-unit domains as
110 antibody targets allowing us to incorporate all the potential epitopes from the Spike protein, and to
111 assess the contribution of each domain to the overall antibody response. In general, we found that
112 antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens differed dramatically between isotypes. As expected, IgG
113 was the dominant isotype generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with antibodies from 97-
114 98% of serum specimens yielding positive recognition of all antigens and antigenic subunits tested
115 (Figure 2a, Table S1,). IgM and IgA were primarily reactive towards the Spike S1 subunit, including
116 the RBD—with 73% and 79% positivity, respectively. The presence of antigen-specific IgM at this
117 convalescent time-point is notable (~ day 40), as IgM is generally considered a biomarker of acute-
                                                                            6

118 phase infection. IgM and IgA with specificity to the nucleocapsid were rare, with only 22% of specimens
119 testing positive for each isotype, respectively. IgM antibodies with specificity for the Spike S2 subunit
120 were even more rare (5%), while IgA responses displayed a 36% positivity rate. As shown in Figure 1,
121 we observed that total SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody increased with disease severity. We next
122 examined individual isotype distributions across disease categories. There was a >1.5 fold increase in
123 IgG generated in the severe COVID-19 group as compared to mild, against all antigens tested (N, RBD,
124 S1, and S2). In addition, IgM against the N-protein had a 1.6-fold increase in the severe group, as
125 compared to mild, with little or no change in other antigens (Figure 2b). Finally, IgA generated against
126 the N-protein and Spike S1 subunit resulted in a 2.4 and 2.0-fold increase, respectively, the largest fold
127 changes observed between mild and severe disease categories. The increase in N-specific IgA is
128 consistent with the observation that exceptionally high levels of serum IgA were associated with acute
129 respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)(https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.21.108308). Furthermore, the
130 observed correlation of IgM and IgA specific for the N-protein increasing with disease severity is
131 reminiscent of the early N-dominated response in deceased individuals reported by (Atyeo et al., 2020).
132 Our results illustrate that while total SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels increase with COVID-19
133 severity, this change is not equal among antibody specificities or isotypes. The increase in total N-
134 specific antibody and spike-specific IgG suggests there are enhanced levels of viral antigens and
135 corresponding increases in T cell-dependent B cell responses during severe COVID-19.
136 IgG Subclass and Antigen Distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 specific Antibody Profile Across COVID-19
137 Disease Severities
138 IgG is the classic antibody isotype involved in T cell-dependent B cell responses, resulting in durable
139 humoral memory. In humans, IgG can be further divided into four functional subclasses – IgG1, IgG2,
140 IgG3, and IgG4. Each subclass has unique properties and effector functions that are primarily driven by
141 the Fc portion of the antibody molecule including complement activation, Fc receptor (FcR) binding, and
142 serum half-life. In particular, the ability of an antibody to bind and signal through FcR on effector cells
                                                                            7

143 can have profound effects on disease resolution in many models of infectious disease. Therefore, we
144 sought to characterize the IgG subclass usage of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response. We found that
145 IgG1 and IgG3 were the dominant IgG subclasses produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection
146 (Figure 3A). The responses to nucleocapsid, RBD, and S1 subunit were each dominated by IgG1 with
147 over 90% of specimens testing positive (Table S2). Strikingly, the IgG response toward the S2 subunit
148 was dominated by the IgG3 subclass with 94% of specimens yielding a positive result. IgG2 responses
149 were moderate, with a positivity rate ranging from 8 to 21%. Finally, IgG4 responses were especially
150 rare with a positivity rate of 0 – 9% (Figure S1, Table S2). Next, we asked whether the IgG subclass
151 representation changes in relation to COVID-19 disease severity. We observed significant increases in
152 both IgG1 and IgG3 with increasing COVID-19 severity, specific for all antigens tested (N, RBD, S1,
153 and S2) (Figure 3B). A small, yet significant increase in N-specific IgG2 was associated with disease
154 severity, while RBD-specific IgG2 trended downward with disease severity. The largest difference was
155 seen with the IgG3-specific response toward the RBD and S1 subunit with a 7 and 6-fold increases in
156 the mean index ratio between the mild and severe groups, respectively. Together, these results
157 highlight distinct differences in the SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody profile among individuals that
158 experience mild, moderate, or severe symptoms of COVID-19.
159 Correlation of Antibody Measurements with COVID-19 Disease Severity
160 We sought to determine a minimal set of criteria that could best distinguish between individuals with
161 different disease severities without overfitting. A training subset of the data was used to create an initial
162 ordered probit regression model that included all potentially predictive variables, including antibody
163 reactivities, sex, age, days post onset, and neutralizing antibody titers. Backwards stepwise selection
164 by Akaike information criterion (AIC) was performed on this model to determine the optimal set of
165 features. When this model’s performance was measured on a testing subset of the data, it displayed
166 higher accuracy (60%, Table S3) than both the initial all-inclusive model and any individual univariate
167 model. The combined model that best discriminates between mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19
                                                                            8

168 includes age, RBD-specific IgG1, and S1-specific IgG3. As shown in Figure 4, the severe group
169 clusters at high IgG1 RBD, IgG3 S1, and age measurements. In contrast, the mild and moderate
170 groups cluster toward lower IgG1 RBD, IgG3 S1, and age measurements. This model suggests that
171 increased age, and Spike-specific IgG responses play important roles in COVID-19 disease severity. In
172 order to account for the confounding effects of age, a similar series of ordered probit regression models
173 were created that included age as a covariate. All variables that were significantly associated with
174 disease severity in the previous models retained their significant association with disease severity
175 except S2-specific IgG1 (Table S4).
176 Correlation of IgG Subclasses with COVID-19 Disease Severity
177 To define the contribution of each IgG subclass to the total SARS-CoV-2 antibody response, we
178 calculated a ratio based on the index value (MFI/cutoff) of each IgG subclass/antigen pair divided by
179 the IgG index value (MFI/cutoff) of the same antigen. While the S1 and RBD-specific IgG1 index ratio
180 remained constant across the severity groupings (Figure 5A), there was a significant enrichment of the
181 RBD-specific and S1- specific IgG3 index ratio in severe patients compared to mild (>10-fold and 2-fold
182 increase, respectively). In contrast, a moderate yet significant decrease of the RBD-specific IgG2 index
183 ratio was observed to correlate with severity. To verify the changes in IgG subclass proportions with
184 respect to COVID-19 severity, we evaluated the relative changes in normalized group means across
185 the three severity groups. The relative change between the mild/moderate, and severe groups was
186 most pronounced for RBD-specific IgG2, and RBD/S1-specific IgG3. The group mean MFI of the RBD-
187 specific IgG2 for patients identified with mild or moderate disease (78.3) was higher than the mean for
188 patients identified with severe disease (27.9). Conversely, the RBD/S1-specific mean for patients
189 identified with mild or moderate disease (164.1/142.9) was significantly lower than patients with severe
190 disease (953.6/598.9). A t-test established statistically significant differences between these group
191 means (0.0004, and 0.0483/0.0320, respectively) (Figure 5B), reinforcing that divergent IgG subclass
192 responses are associated with COVID-19 disease severity.

193 A correlation network was created to examine the relationship between antibody isotypes, subclasses,
194 antigen specificity, viral neutralization, and clinical features of the HCW dataset. The network was
195 based on a comprehensive correlation matrix (Figure S2), and stringently gated on only the strongest
196 associations with a Spearman’s coefficient above 0.65. As expected, S1 and RBD measurements were
197 highly correlated, as were IgG and corresponding IgG subclasses. A dominant network cluster was
198 formed between N-specific IgG, S1-specific IgG (including the RBD domain), and viral neutralizing titers
199 (Figure 6). N-specific IgG/IgG1/IgG3 formed its own mini-cluster on the edge of the highly inter-related
200 IgG response to S1 and RBD. In addition, PRNT50 and PRNT90 measurements were very strongly
201 correlated with each other (rs = 0.848), and the PRNT90 measurement was strongly correlated (0.5 ≤ rs
202 ≤ 0.7) with IgG, IgG1, antibodies targeting the S1 domain and RBD of the spike protein. This cluster
203 was also significantly correlated with disease severity, as determined by ordered probit regression
204 (Table S3). IgM, IgA, and IgG2 responses to S1 and RBD, were also highly correlated, but separate
205 from the central cluster. Taken together, our results reveal a shift in the proportional Spike-specific IgG
206 response toward the highly inflammatory IgG3 subclass (Vidarsson et al., 2014) that is linked to
207 COVID-19 disease severity, and not with increases in viral neutralizing activity.

208 Discussion
209 In the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the serum antibody response to
210 SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of more than 500 recovered HCW who experienced varying degrees of
211 COVID-19 severity. In general, we found that age, total SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody, and viral
212 neutralizing activity was increased in individuals who experienced severe disease. The serological
213 profile for those who experienced severe COVID-19 was characterized by both a global increase in N-
214 specific antibodies, as well as an increase in spike-specific IgG. The overall increase in SARS-CoV-2
215 specific antibody in severe patients may be due to increased viral loads, and thus increased antigen for
216 driving humoral responses. Paradoxically, high-titer, neutralizing antibodies are known to be protective,
217 and a biomarker of immunity in many viral infections (Ng et al., 2019; Plotkin, 2010). To rectify the
218 disconnect between increased antibodies, increased neutralization, and increased disease severity, we
219 performed a thorough analysis of the IgG subclass response to SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis revealed a
220 substantial difference in the spike-specific IgG subclass composition, where a greater proportion of S1
221 and RBD-specific IgG3, and lower proportion of S1-specific IgG2 were associated with COVID-19
222 severity. Spike-specific IgG1, and not IgG3 was most closely correlated with in vitro viral neutralization,
223 leading us to the conclusion that excess IgG3 may play an inflammatory role in the pathogenesis of
224 COVID-19 in some individuals.
225 In viral infections, blockade of cell attachment, and direct viral neutralization are thought to be the
226 primary effector mechanisms through which antibodies contribute to host protection. However,
227 antibodies also facilitate other mechanisms of pathogen clearance through the conserved Fc portion of
228 the molecule. In humans, IgG1 and IgG3 are the most common subclasses elicited by viral infections
229 (Ferrante et al., 1990). While IgG1 is the most abundant subclass in the serum, IgG3 is particularly
230 effective at inducing effector functions through high affinity interactions with complement proteins and
231 by activating type 1 Fc receptors. In fact, IgG3-dependent antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis
232 (ADCP), and cytotoxicity (ADCC), were shown to be critical mechanisms for vaccine-mediated
                                                                            11

233 protection against HIV (Chung et al., 2014; Neidich et al., 2019). The importance of antibody-mediated
234 effector functions has also been shown for COVID-19 disease resolution, where Spike-specific ADCP,
235 antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP), and antibody-dependent complement deposition
236 (ADCD) were enhanced in COVID-19 survivors. However, Spike-specific antibodies that primarily
237 promoted Fc-mediated NK cell activities were expanded in non-survivors, highlighting the potential for
238 potent Fc-mediated functions to exacerbate pathologic inflammation (Atyeo et al., 2020). The large
239 proportional increase of RBD-specific IgG3 (>10-fold) in severe COVID-19 suggests these antibodies
240 may promote immunopathology rather than tissue repair. Therefore, we propose that an unbalanced
241 IgG response, enriched in IgG3 promotes excess inflammation, exacerbating the symptoms of COVID-
242 19. Supporting our hypothesis, Lui et al. showed that anti-spike IgG promoted acute lung injury in
243 humans and macaques infected with SARS-CoV-1 through macrophage polarization to an inflammatory
244 phenotype (Liu et al., 2019). Serum from COVID-19 patients who experienced severe symptoms was
245 also shown to promote the release of disease promoting neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), although
246 the stimulating factor was not addressed (Zuo et al., 2020). Finally, both immune complexes and
247 complement pathways were shown to play a pathogenic role in IgG-mediated lung injury in pandemic
248 H1N1 influenza infection (Monsalvo et al., 2011). Future studies are needed to address the FcR
249 dependence and functional differences of IgG1 and IgG3 in COVID-19 serum. Cryoglobulins are a
250 group of antibodies that precipitate in blood at temperatures below 37°C, and their presence is
251 associated with autoimmune and chronic infectious diseases with pathologic effects including vascular,
252 renal, and neurologic complications. Interestingly, IgG3 is the only IgG subclass capable of forming
253 cryoglobulins through Fc-Fc interactions (Otani et al., 2012). Determination of the glycosylation status
254 of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies is also warranted to assess the potential inflammatory nature of
255 antibodies in severe COVID-19 (Wang and Ravetch, 2019). In conclusion, we recommend that the
256 contribution of S1 and RBD-specific IgG3 to COVID-19 disease severity should be a strong
257 consideration for both SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design, monoclonal antibody therapeutics, and
258 convalescent plasma therapy.

259 Limitations of Study
260 The size of our patient cohort enabled a robust analysis of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in
261 individuals with self-reported mild, moderate, or severe disease. However, the addition of samples from
262 the of the full spectrum of COVID-19 presentation, including asymptomatic individuals, and non-
263 survivors would significantly strengthen our study. The convalescent time-point at which this study was
264 conducted allowed us to capture a large cohort that was with well documented clinical criteria.
265 However, the late time-point (day 40 post onset) of this study weakens the predictive capacity of our
266 analysis for earlier points during infection. In future studies we would like to follow a comprehensive
267 cohort of individuals from COVID-19 symptom onset through and beyond recovery to assess how the
268 early immune response influences both disease severity, and durable memory.

340 Materials and Methods
341 COVID-19 Serum Samples
342 Studies were performed on sera from clinical specimens submitted to the Wadsworth Center, New York
343 State Department of Health for determination of antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2. The study
344 population were recovered individuals who were all RT-PCR confirmed by Roche COVAS 6800 or
345 Cepheid XPert for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and who had a self-reported degree of disease
346 severity (mild, moderate, or severe). All individuals had recovered from the disease and had defined
347 days between the onset of symptoms and sample collection. Specimens were stored at 4°C until
348 clinical tested was completed (>1 week) and transferred to -80°C for long-term storage. Aliquots were
349 made to minimize freeze-thaw. All testing and archiving of human specimens was approved by
350 NYSDOH Institutional Review Board (IRB 20-021).
351 Reagents
352 For MIAs, wash buffer and phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4, 0.05% sodium azide (PBS-TN) were
353 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Chemicals, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)
354 carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS), were supplied by Pierce
355 Chemicals (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Microspheres, calibration microspheres, and sheath ﬂuid were
356 obtained from Luminex Corporation (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX). R-phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated goat
357 anti-human Ig, goat anti-human IgG, anti-human IgM, anti-human IgA, mouse anti-human IgG1, mouse
358 anti-human IgG2, mouse anti-human IgG3, and mouse anti-human IgG4 were purchased (Southern
359 Biotech). Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike S2 domain were purchased (Native
360 Antigen, Oxfordshire, UK). Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD and spike S1 domain were provided by
361 MassBiologics (Boston, MA), and produced as described below.

364 The amino-acid sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein sequence (GeneBank: MN908947) were
365 used to design a codon-optimized version for mammalian cell expression. The synthetic gene encoding
366 the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) a.a. 319- 541 and S1 subunit a.a. 1-604 of the S glycoproteins
367 were cloned into pcDNA 3.1 Myc/His in-frame with c-Myc and 6-histidine epitope tags that enabled
368 detection and purification. The cloned genes were sequenced to confirm that no errors had
369 accumulated during the cloning process. All constructs were transfected into Expi293 cells using
370 ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Kit (Thermo Fisher). And recombinant proteins were purified by
371 immobilized metal chelate affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose
372 beads. Proteins were eluted from the columns using 250 mmol/L imidazole and then dialyzed into
373 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2 and checked for size and purity by sodium dodecyl sulfate
374 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
375 Microsphere Immunoassay
376 Specimens were assessed for the presence of antibodies reactive with SARS-CoV-2 using an MIA
377 modified from a previously described procedure (Wong et al., 2017). Briefly, recombinant SARS-CoV-2
378 nucleocapsid and spike RBD, S1, and S2 subunits were covalently linked to the surface of fluorescent
379 microspheres (Luminex Corporation). Serum samples (25 µL at 1:100 dilution) and antigen-conjugated
380 microspheres (25 µL at 5x104 microspheres/mL) were mixed and incubated 30 minutes at 37°C before
381 washing and further incubation with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated secondary antibody. The PE-
382 conjugated antibodies were chosen to specifically recognize, as indicated, total antibodies (pan-Ig), or,
383 individually IgM, IgA, IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4. After washing and final resuspension in buffer, the
384 samples were analyzed on a FlexMap 3D analyzer using xPONENT software, version 4.3 (Luminex
385 Corporation).
386 Plaque Reduction Neutralization Assay (PRNT)
387 This assay has been described and is considered the standard for determination of neutralizing virus-
388 specific antibody titers (Calisher et al., 1989; Lindsey et al., 1976; Shambaugh et al., 2017). For the
                                                                            19

389 detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, 2-fold serially diluted test serum (100l) was mixed
390 with 100l of 150-200 plaque forming units (PFUs) of SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020, BEI
391 Resources, NR-52281) and incubated for 1 h at 37C, 5% CO2. The virus:serum mixture (100l) was
392 applied to VeroE6 cells (C1008, ATCC CRL-1586) grown to 95-100% confluency in 6 well plates.
393 Adsorption of the virus:serum mixture was allowed to proceed for 1 hour at 37C, 5% CO2. Following
394 the adsorption period, a 0.6% agar overlay prepared in cell culture medium (Eagle’s Minimal Essential
395 Medium, 2% heat inactivated FBS, 100g/ml Penicillin G, 100 U/ml Streptomycin) was applied. Two
396 days post-infection, a second agar overlay containing 0.2% neutral red prepared in cell culture medium
397 was applied, and the number of plaques in each sample well were recorded after an additional 1-2 days
398 incubation. Neutralizing titers were defined as the inverse of the highest dilution of serum providing
399 50% (PRNT50) or 90% (PRNT90) viral plaque reduction relative to a virus only control.
400 Data Analysis
401 Subjects with known disease severity and sex were included in ordered probit regression analysis. The
402 data was randomly separated into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets. Data was then centered by
403 subtracting the mean of each predictor from that predictor’s values, and then scaled by dividing by the
404 standard deviation. Imputation of missing values was performed using the k-nearest neighbors
405 algorithm. Each created model’s accuracy was assessed by measuring its performance on the testing
406 subset of data. One-sided binomial tests were performed to determine if the accuracy of each model
407 was significantly better than the no-information rate. Variable selection for the final model was
408 performed by backwards stepwise selection by Akaike information criterion.
409 For construction of the correlation matrix, Spearman’s correlations were calculated using all complete
410 pairs of variables in the dataset. All associated p-values were then adjusted via the Benjamini and
411 Hochberg method. The network created using these Spearman’s correlations was gated to only include
412 those relationships with an rs > 0.65. Eigenvector centrality was calculated for each variable and is
                                                                            20
