                 Infectious disease outbreaks are expected to grow exponentially in time when left unchecked. Con-
              tainment measures such as lockdown and social distancing can drastically alter the growth dynamics
              of the outbreak. This is the case for the 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak, which is characterized by a
              power law growth. Strikingly however, the power law exponent is different across countries. Here I
              illustrate the relationship between these two extreme scenarios, exponential and power law growth,
              based on the impact of superspreaders and lockdown strategies to contain the outbreak. The theory
              predicts a relationship between the power law exponent and the time interval between the first case
              and lockdown that is validated by the observed COVID-19 data across different countries.
   Research from the late 90s and the 2000s uncovered                            At the first generation we expect R0 infected individu-
