    Abstract
              Although anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin
    (LMWH, e.g. enoxaparin) are both being used for therapeutic mitigation of COVID associated
    coagulopathy (CAC), differences in their clinical outcomes remain to be investigated. Here, we
    employ automated neural networks supplemented with expert curation (‘augmented curation’) for
    retrospectively analyzing the complete electronic health records (EHRs) of 671 hospitalized
    COVID-19 patients administered either enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin, but not both. We
    find that COVID-19 patients administered unfractionated heparin but not enoxaparin have higher
    rates of mortality (risk ratio: 2.6; 95% C.I.: [1.2-5.4]; p-value: 0.02; BH adjusted p-value: 0.09),
    thrombotic events (risk ratio: 5.7, 95% C.I.: [2.1, 33.9], p-value: 0.024), acute kidney injury (risk
    ratio: 5.5; 95% C.I.: [1.2-17.7]; p-value: 0.02; BH adjusted p-value: 0.10), and bacterial pneumonia
    (risk ratio undefined; 95% C.I.: [1.0, 292]; p-value:0.02; BH adjusted p-value:0.10), compared to
    patients administered enoxaparin but not unfractionated heparin. Notably, even after controlling
    for potential confounding factors such as demographics, comorbidities, admission diagnosis,
    initial ICU status, and initial level of oxygen support, the above differences between the
    enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin patient cohorts remain statistically significant. This study
    emphasizes the need for mechanistically investigating differential modulation of the COVID-
    associated coagulation cascades by enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin.
    Introduction
              COVID-19 manifests in varying levels of patient outcomes ranging from mild, moderate to
    severe disease1–3. While the mild/asymptomatic patients have been managed through
    quarantining and self-medication, the optimal management of hospitalized moderately ill or
    severely ill COVID-19 patients remains a formidable challenge. Owing to the diversity of
    comorbidities and complications in the afflicted patients and the overwhelming pace of the
    pandemic the regimen of medications in COVID-19 critical care is yet to be standardized.
    Meanwhile, the accumulation of real-world data on patient outcomes of COVID-19 from various
    healthcare systems provides an excellent opportunity to identify underlying trends that could lead
    to actionable insights.

              Coagulopathies are a major class among COVID-19 associated complications4,
    particularly in a critical care setting5. Prior studies have provided a fine grained resolution of the
    hematological parameters in COVID-19 patients6. Trials comparing anticoagulation treatments
    are ongoing, however owing to the wide-spread and severe impact of the disease, there is a need
    for evaluation of observational data in order to rapidly generate evidence to guide treatment7. A
    spectrum of anticoagulants such as Heparin, Enoxaparin, and Rivaroxaban are being used in
    COVID-19 patient management as needed8,9. A clinical trial is being designed to examine whether
    prophylactic-dose enoxaparin improves survival and reduces hospitalizations in older (age > 50)
    symptomatic ambulatory patients10. Furthermore, recent in vitro studies have shown that
    pseudotyped viral particles were efficiently neutralized by a variety of anticoagulants 11. In
    addition, results from a phase II clinical trial found that patients treated with therapeutic
    enoxaparin had improved gas exchange and more ventilator-free days compared to patients
    treated with standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis12. However, the full array of patient
    outcomes associated with various anticoagulants remains to be understood. The availability of
    patient outcomes and drugs administered in Mayo Clinic sites and associated health systems
    enables us to address this question. Here, we present a comparison of the patient outcomes in
    terms of mortality status, ICU admission and the durations of stay in ICU and hospital in severe
    COVID-19 patients that were administered Heparin vs. Enoxaparin. We use propensity score
    matching to construct matched cohorts for comparison which are balanced across a range of
    clinical covariates, including: demographics, comorbidities, admission diagnosis, initial ICU
    status, and initial level of oxygen support (see Methods). The clinical covariates for the study
    populations of the original and matched cohorts are presented in Table 1. The outcomes for the
    original and matched cohorts are presented in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.
    Results
    Patients that were administered enoxaparin have lower mortality rates, lower ICU
    admission rates, and shorter hospital / ICU stays
              We compared the mortality rate and ICU admission rate in patients from the curated Mayo
    Clinic dataset of 671 hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received either enoxaparin or heparin,
    but not both. Of these patients, 464 were administered enoxaparin but not unfractionated heparin;
    of these 14 (3%) were deceased. For comparison, 207 patients were administered heparin but
    not enoxaparin. Of these patients, 32 (15%) were deceased. Comparing the mortality outcomes,
    patients in the heparin only cohort have a higher mortality rate than those in the opposing
    enoxaparin cohort (risk ratio of death: 5.12; 95% C.I.: [2.76, 9.10]; adjusted p-value 1.7e-8) (Table
    2). Of the 464 patients administered enoxaparin but not heparin, 90 (19%) were later admitted to
    the ICU. Similarly, of the 207 patients administered heparin but not enoxaparin, 70 (34%) were
    admitted to the ICU. Comparing the ICU admission status, patients administered heparin had a
    higher admission to ICU rate compared to Enoxaparin (risk ratio of ICU admission: 1.74; 95%
    C.I.: [1.34, 2.27]; adjusted p-value 9.8e-5) (Table 2).
              Next we compared the lengths of stay in the ICU and the overall length of stay in the
    hospital. Here, we restricted the analysis to only patients that were alive. The length of stay in the
    ICU and in the hospital were shorter for patients administered enoxaparin but not heparin (mean
                                                                                                                                       2

    ICU duration: 0.9 days, mean hospital duration: 5.4 days) compared to the patients administered
    heparin but not enoxaparin (mean ICU duration: 2.8 days, mean hospital duration: 8.1 days)
    (Table 2). The difference in hospital length of stay and ICU length of stay across the two cohorts
    are both statistically significant according to a t-test (hospital duration adjusted p-value: 1.5e-8;
    ICU duration adjusted p-value: 1.5e-8). Taken together, this suggests preliminarily that
    enoxaparin is correlated with a lower mortality rate, ICU admission rate and ICU and hospital
    length of stay compared to heparin. Also of note are the increased rates of acute kidney injury
    (risk ratio: 5.2; 95% C.I.: [2.68-9.71]; adjusted p-value 7.8e-7), bacterial pneumonia (risk ratio:
    5.37; 95% C.I.: [1.89-13.67]; adjusted p-value 2.6e-3) and co-/secondary infection (risk ratio: 5.97;
    95% C.I.: [2.32-13.86]; adjusted p-value 1.9e-4) in the heparin cohort (Table 4). On examination
    of cause of death for deceased patients for both cohorts, it is clear that the majority of deaths
    occurring in both the heparin and enoxaparin cohorts are driven primarily by COVID-19
    associated causes giving an indication that divergent rates of mortality between the cohorts is not
    the result of extraneous illness or accidents (Table 5).
    After controlling for potential confounding variables, patients that were administered
    enoxaparin have lower mortality rates
              To simultaneously account for the effects of a range of possible confounders, we also
    examined statistical differences in outcomes between 1:1 propensity matched cohorts of patients
    who received enoxaparin but not heparin vs patients who received heparin but not enoxaparin.
    These cohorts were originally 464 and 207 patients, respectively; after 1:1 propensity score
    matching we were left with 2 cohorts of size 143; we refer to these cohorts as the “matched
    enoxaparin” and “matched heparin” cohorts respectively. Quality of balance between covariates
    is shown in Table 1. Most covariates (including demographics, comorbidities, and conditions on
    admission) are well-matched.
              Of the 158 patients in the matched enoxaparin cohort, 8 (5.6%) were eventually deceased;
    in the matched heparin cohort, 21 (15%) were deceased (Table 3). The rate of mortality in the
    matched heparin cohort was higher (chi-square p-value 0.02; adjusted p-value 0.09) (Table 3).
    The risk ratio of mortality for heparin patients is 2.63 (95% CI: [1.18, 5.41]). Mean hospital length
    of stay (among alive patients) for matched heparin was 6.9 days vs 5.8 days for matched
    enoxaparin. Mean ICU length of stay (among alive patients) for matched heparin was 1.9 days vs
    1.1 days for matched enoxaparin patients. However, neither difference was significant (hospital
    duration adjusted p-value: 0.17; ICU duration adjusted p-value 0.17).
              Difference in rates of certain complications among the matched cohorts were analyzed.
    Complications that occurred at a higher rate in the matched heparin cohort than the matched
    enoxaparin cohort include acute kidney injury (7.7% vs 1.4%, chi-square p-value 0.2, BH-adjusted
    p-value 0.10) and bacterial pneumonia (5.6% vs 0%, chi-square p-value 0.01, BH-adjusted p-
    value 0.10) (Table 6). However, we note that due to small cohort sizes none of these differences
    were statistically significant after taking into account the adjustment for multiple hypotheses.
    Augmented curation of EHR patient notes shows that patients that were administered
                                                                                                                                       3

    enoxaparin have lower rates of thrombotic events
              We aimed to see if there were differences in occurrence of thrombotic events amongst
    patients treated strictly with Heparin and those treated strictly with Enoxaparin. To do so, we used
    a BERT-based neural network to extract thrombotic events from EHR notes and classify the
    sentences sentiment. If the note was dated within the timeframe of up to 28-days after that
    patient’s first hospitalization date and contained positive sentiment for a thrombotic event (with
    >= 0.9 confidence), a patient was considered to have experienced that thrombotic event. Similarly,
    we identified patients that have thrombotic comorbidities. Patients were considered as having a
    thrombotic comorbidity if they experienced a thrombotic event up to a year prior to their first
    hospitalization date. Thrombotic events considered were deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary
    embolism, myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, thrombotic stroke, cerebral venous
    thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
              We found that, across all thrombotic phenotypes, there is a greater or equal rate of
    complications during the study period (days 0 to 28) for the Heparin cohort relative to the
    Enoxaparin cohort (risk ratio: 5.7, 95% C.I.: [2.1, 33.9], p-value: 0.024). In particular, for deep
    vein thrombosis, the rate is 0.2% in the enoxaparin cohort versus 2.9% in the heparin cohort (risk
    ratio: 13.5, 95% C.I.:[1.7, 56.8], p-value: 0.01, adjusted p-value: 0.04) (Table 7). Note that in the
    year leading up to the study period, there is not a statistically significant difference between these
    two cohorts (risk ratio: 1.5, 95% C.I.:[0.47, 5.1], p-value: 0.77, adjusted p-value: 1.0) (Table 8).
    Discussion
              This retrospective study highlights interesting differences in the outcomes associated with
    anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients, warranting further follow up. A few caveats are in order.
    Compounding this limitation, enoxaparin and heparin differ in FDA label indications. The label for
    enoxaparin13 includes the prophylaxis and treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or
    without pulmonary embolism (PE) in various settings, the prophylaxis of ischemic complications
    of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI), and the treatment of acute ST-
    segment elevation MI managed medically or with subsequent percutaneous coronary
    intervention. The label for heparin14 includes includes similar prophylactic indications as well as
    the treatment of a broader spectrum of acute embolic events including peripheral arterial
    embolism and embolism in the setting of atrial fibrillation, the treatment of consumptive
    coagulopathies, and usage as an anticoagulant in high-risk patient groups such as those
    undergoing blood transfusions, extracorporeal circulation, and dialysis procedures. Furthermore,
    it is important to analyze whether these medications were administered as prophylactics or in
    treatment for a complication. Thus, it is possible that the patient population receiving heparin is
    more severely or acutely ill to begin with. In follow-up analyses, it may be interesting to consider
    initial laboratory values such as eGFR as a measure of baseline liver function as well.
              Nevertheless, accumulating evidence suggests that enoxaparin may be more efficacious
    than heparin in certain cases such as for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes15. Also of
    interest as a driver of differential outcomes is the phenomenon of Heparin Induced
                                                                                                                                       4

    Thrombocytopenia (HIT), a drug reaction associated with decreased platelet count and a high risk
    of thrombosis. HIT is caused by platelet-activating antibodies against PF4/heparin complexes and
    has been shown to occur in some circumstances in COVID-19 patients treated with unfractionated
    heparin16. These findings highlight the plausibility of a biological underpinning to the observations
    reported in the present work. Overall, these results motivate future studies and trials that could
    enable the development of more efficacious standard of practice in regards to administration of
    anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients.
    Methods
    Study Design
              This research was conducted under IRB 20-003278, “Study of COVID-19 patient
    characteristics with augmented curation of Electronic Health Records (EHR) to inform strategic
    and operational decisions”, approved by the Mayo Clinic’s institutional review board (IRB). Under
    this IRB, an observational study was conducted with a study population of 1108 patients, defined
    as hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days prior to admission or
    during admission to the hospital. Data available for analysis includes patient demographics (age,
    gender, race, etc.) as well as clinical data (medications administered, vital signs, ICD-10
    diagnoses, etc.). Using this information, a dataset was assembled including key covariates and
    outcomes measures derived from structured clinical data. Covariates of interest include age,
    height, weight, comorbidities, admissions diagnoses, oxygenation methods, etc.
              ICD-10 diagnosis data was consumed and used to define three sets of diagnoses of
    interest for the patient population. Complications are defined as diagnoses recorded during the
    patient’s treatment process. Admission diagnoses are defined as diagnoses made on the day of
    admission to the hospital, or within 7 day prior to admission. Comorbidities are defined as
    diagnoses made from a year prior to admission up to 7 days prior to admission to the hospital.
    For each of these categories a number of conditions were specified as being of interest and ICD-
    10 codes were selected to represent each of these conditions. ICD-10 codes used in this analysis
    are included in the supplement (see Supplementary Material).
              To compare the outcomes of patients taking different anticoagulants, two cohorts were
    constructed: (i) patients who were administered enoxaparin but not heparin and (ii) patients who
    were administered heparin but not enoxaparin. The cohort sizes were 464 and 207 respectively.
    A number of statistical tests were conducted to identify any differences in outcomes. Statistical
    tests were applied to a number of outcomes (with Benjamini-Hochberg procedure applied to
    account for the problem of multiple comparisons; details below). Initially the following 5 outcomes
    were analyzed: (1) mortality status (i.e. was the patient ever recorded as deceased), (2) 28-day
    confirmed mortality status (i.e. of patients for whom we have have some confirmation of mortality
    status at 28 days following hospitalization, was the patient among the deceased), (3) ICU
    admission during hospitalization, (4) length of stay in the hospital (among alive patients), (5)
    length of stay in ICU (among alive patients).
              To further characterize the outcomes of the 2 cohorts, occurrence of each of the following
    9 complications from day 0 to day 28 were also analyzed: (1) acute kidney injury, (2) bacterial
                                                                                                                                       5

    pneumonia, (3) cardiac arrest, (4) cardiac arrhythmia, (5) co- or secondary infection, (6) liver
    dysfunction, (7) pleural effusions, (8) stroke/cerebrovascular incident, and (9) Viral pneumonitis.
              To account for potentially confounding variables, we performed propensity score matching
    to balance covariates between the two cohorts. The statistical tests for differences in outcomes
    were repeated on the matched cohorts. The covariates which were balanced include
    demographics, comorbidities and various features on admission. Further detail on the procedure,
    including a listing of covariates used, is below.
    Risk Ratio
              Risk Ratios for Admission to the ICU and Mortality Status were calculated for patient
    cohorts defined by anticoagulant usage and presence of select comorbidities. Risk Ratio across
    two cohorts of interest is calculated by dividing the proportion of cohort 1 which responds
    affirmatively to a feature (or all members of a set of features) by the proportion of cohort 2 which
    responds affirmatively to the same feature (or set of features). Risk Ratio along with
    accompanying 95% confidence intervals for each cohort pair are calculated.
    Chi-Square
              A Pearson’s Chi-Square test was run to test for statistically significant differences in
    proportion of occurrence of features across cohort pairs. This was done using the
    stats.chi2_contingency function of the scipy python package. Test statistics and p-values are
    reported for each cohort pair.
    t-Test
              A two-sided t-test was performed to identify statistically significant differences in Hospital
    Length of Stay and ICU Length of Stay across two cohorts of patients who were discharged from
    the hospital alive and received different anticoagulants (enoxaparin and heparin). P-values are
    reported for these tests.
    Benjamini-Hochberg correction
              As we are comparing multiple outcomes between two anticoagulant cohorts, a Benjamini-
    Hochberg correction is applied to a set of outcomes. Mortality was identified as a primary outcome
    prior to performing the tests, so it may not be necessary to apply the Benjamini-Hochberg
    correction on that p-value; however, adjusted p-values are reported for all outcomes.
    Propensity score matching
              The two cohorts that were balanced were (i) the 464 patients who were administered
    enoxaparin but not heparin and (ii) the 207 patients who were administered heparin but not
    enoxaparin. Propensity scores were computed by fitting a logistic regression model to predict
    which of the 2 cohorts the patient was in, as a function of the covariates (listed further below).
                                                                                                                                       6

    After computing propensity scores, 1:1 matching was done, using a heuristic caliper of 0.1 x
    pooled std deviation and allowing for drops.17 143 matched pairs were found. After checking for
    quality of cohort balance (see Table 1), the same statistical procedures (chi-square test, t-test,
    risk ratio). were then run on the two matched cohorts of 143 patients each to identify if differences
    in outcome persist after the adjustments.
              The covariates used for balancing are the following. Note all variables below except for
    age are binary.

         ● Diagnosis on admission: whether or not the patient is reported to have each of the
              following conditions on admission to hospital. (1) acute kidney injury, (2) bacterial
              pneumonia, (3) cardiac arrhythmias, (4) delirium / encephalopathy, (5) sepsis, (6) stroke
         ● Oxygenation status on day of admission: whether or not the patient is reported to have
              received the following forms of oxygen therapy on admission
    Augmented curation of thrombotic event phenotypes from the unstructured text of the
    Electronic Health Record (EHR) clinical notes
              We used a previously developed state-of-the-art BERT-based neural network to classify
    sentiment of clinical manifestations and diagnoses in the EHR. Specifically, the model extracts
    sentences containing clinical phenotypes and classifies their sentiment into the following
    categories: Yes (confirmed clinical manifestation or diagnosis), No (ruled out clinical manifestation
    or diagnosis), Maybe (possibility of clinical manifestation or diagnosis), and Other (alternate
    context, e.g. family history of disease). The model was trained using 18,490 sentences and
    approximately 250 phenotypes with an emphasis on cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic
    phenotypes. It achieves 93.6% overall accuracy and over 95% precision and recall for both “Yes”
    and “No” sentiment classification.

    Table 7: Comparison of thrombotic events from Day 0 to Day 28. Counts of patients with
    thrombotic events reported in the clinical notes in days 0 to 28 among the cohorts administered
    Heparin only and Enoxaparin only, along with p-values from Chi-squared statistical tests.
    Presence of thrombotic events in the clinical notes was determined via a BERT-based neural
    network model. The thrombotic events considered included: deep vein thrombosis (DVT),
    cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), venous thromboembolism (VTE), disseminated intravascular
    coagulation (DIC), pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial infarction (MI), and cerebral stroke.

    Table 8: Comparison of thrombotic events from Day -365 to Day -1. Counts of patients with
    thrombotic events reported in the clinical notes in days -365 to -1 among the cohorts administered
    Heparin only and Enoxaparin only, along with p-values from Chi-squared statistical tests.
    Presence of thrombotic events in the clinical notes was determined via a BERT-based neural
    network model. The thrombotic event phenotypes considered included: deep vein thrombosis
    (DVT), cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), venous thromboembolism (VTE), disseminated
    intravascular coagulation (DIC), pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial infarction (MI), and
    cerebral stroke.
