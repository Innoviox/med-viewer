   Mason et al - Inflammatory markers in COVID-19
20 Abstract
21 Background
22 COVID-19 is infrequently complicated by secondary bacterial infection, but nevertheless antibiotic
23 prescriptions are common. We used community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) as a benchmark to define the
24 processes that occur in a bacterial pulmonary infection, and tested the hypothesis that baseline inflammatory
25 markers and their response to antibiotic therapy could distinguish CAP from COVID-19.
26 Methods
27 In patients admitted to Royal Free Hospital (RFH) and Barnet Hospital (BH) we defined CAP by lobar
28 consolidation on chest radiograph, and COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 detection by PCR. Data were derived from
29 routine laboratory investigations.
30 Results
31 On admission all CAP and >90% COVID-19 patients received antibiotics. We identified 106 CAP and 619 COVID-
32 19 patients at RFH. CAP was characterised by elevated white cell count (WCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP)
33 compared to COVID-19 (median WCC 12.48 (IQR 8.2-15.3) vs 6.78 (IQR 5.2-9.5) x106 cells/ml and median CRP
34 CRP 133.5 (IQR 65-221) vs 86 (IQR 42-160) mg/L). Blood samples collected 48-72 hours into admission revealed
35 decreasing CRP in CAP but not COVID-19 (CRP difference -33 (IQR -112 to +3.5) vs +15 (IQR -15 to +70) mg/L
36 respectively). In the independent validation cohort (BH) consisting of 169 CAP and 181 COVID-19 patients,
37 admission WCC >8.2x106 cells/ml or falling CRP during admission identified 95% of CAP cases, and predicted
38 the absence of bacterial co-infection in 45% of COVID-19 patients.
39 Conclusions
40 We propose that in COVID-19 the absence of both elevated baseline WCC and antibiotic-related decrease in
41 CRP can exclude bacterial co-infection and facilitate antibiotic stewardship efforts.

   Mason et al - Inflammatory markers in COVID-19
43 Introduction
44 The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 34 million
45 infections and over 1 million deaths worldwide [1]. The drivers of pathology remain to be elucidated, but a
46 hyperinflammatory response is associated with worse case fatality [2]. Other viral respiratory tract infections,
47 best characterised by influenza, can be complicated by bacterial co-infections that also raise inflammatory
48 markers and are associated with high mortality [3,4], but distinguishing severe viral pneumonia from bacterial
49 co-infection is challenging [5]. In COVID-19, several studies have found bacterial co-infection to be rare, as
50 determined by identification of causative pathogens [6–9]. However, routine microbiological culture takes
51 several days, lacks sensitivity [10] and does not readily distinguish bacterial colonisation from infection.
52 Moreover, microbiological respiratory tract sampling is not routinely performed in patients admitted with
53 COVID-19 [9]. Therefore, despite guidance aimed at rationalising antibiotic use [11], it is unsurprising that
54 diverse and elevated rates of antibiotic prescriptions have been reported in patients admitted for COVID-19
55 infection [8,9].
56 It is likely that many COVID-19 associated antibiotic prescriptions are given in the absence of bacterial co-
57 infection, thus hampering antimicrobial stewardship efforts and potentially increasing antimicrobial resistance
58 [12–14]. Many studies have focused on clinical and laboratory features that risk stratify outcome in COVID-19
59 [15–18], but currently infections caused by virus alone cannot be readily distinguished from those with a
60 bacterial component. C-reactive protein (CRP), white cell count (WCC) and procalcitonin (PCT) have been used
61 to distinguish between influenza and bacterial pneumonia, allowing antibiotic treatment to be omitted or
62 stopped [19–22]. Serial measurements of inflammatory markers may also assist in distinguishing bacterial
63 from viral infections [23,24]. A small retrospective study comparing COVID-19 to community-acquired
64 pneumonia patients identified differences in admission neutrophil counts, D-dimers and CRP, but did not
65 provide a rigorous definition for the pneumonia cases, nor explored changes in these markers over time [25].
66 In this study we aimed to identify features that discriminated viral COVID-19 infections from those complicated
67 by bacterial co-infection. We used community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) as a benchmark to define the
68 processes that occur in bacterial pulmonary infections, and tested the hypothesis that baseline inflammatory
69 markers and their response to antibiotics could distinguish CAP from most COVID-19 infections. To address
70 this research question, we performed a retrospective, cohort study from a large split-site academic hospital in
71 the UK. We used the independent nature of the two sites to discover and validate our findings, extending their
72 generalisability.

 73 Methods
 74 Data extraction and ethics
 75 Anonymised demographics, antimicrobial prescriptions, haematological and biochemical investigations were
 76 extracted from the Clinical Practice Group analysis team, Cerner Electronic Patient Records and the electronic
 77 Clinical Infection Database (elCID), and microbiological investigations from WinPath at Royal Free London (RFL)
 78 NHS Trust [26]. The study was approved by the Research and Innovation Group at RFL NHS Trust, which stated
 79 that confidential patient information could be used under COVID-19 COPI notice made by Department of
 80 Health and Social Care, and that as this was a retrospective review of routine clinical data, formal ethical
 81 approval was not required.
 82 Patient selection
 83 We identified patients from 2 hospital sites of RFL NHS Trust in London, UK: Royal Free Hospital (RFH) and
 84 Barnet Hospital (BH). These hospitals are separated by 11 kilometres and patient care is delivered by non-
 85 overlapping clinical staff, using non-identical clinical care bundles and antibiotic policies. We included patients
 86 aged >18 years old admitted to hospital, of which a subset was admitted for >48 hours (tables 1 & 4), and
 87 excluded patients with haematological malignancies. We defined COVID-19 and influenza patients by RT-PCR
 88 detection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A or B viruses respectively from nasopharyngeal swabs. COVID-19
 89 patients were identified between 1st March and 31st May 2020, and influenza patients between 1st January
 90 and 31st May 2019. These criteria yielded 619 and 181 COVID-19 patients from RFH and BH respectively, and
 91 188 and 162 influenza patients from RFH and BH respectively. There were no patients co-infected with SARS-
 92 CoV-2 and influenza viruses. CAP patients were identified by a clinical diagnosis of CAP made between 1st
 93 January and 31st May 2019 with focal consolidation on chest radiograph reported by consultant radiologists
 94 (106 patients at RFH and 169 at BH).
 95 For some analyses, we excluded COVID-19 patients with radiological or microbiological evidence of ongoing
 96 bacterial co-infection. This was defined by presence of lobar pneumonia on a chest radiograph within 72 hours
 97 of hospital admission, or by a non-contaminant bacterial growth on blood culture, growth in sputum samples
 98 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus or Moraxella catarrhalis, detection of Mycoplasma
 99 pneumoniae by PCR from sputum or detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen in urine (tables 1 & 3 and
100 table S1).
101 Statistical analysis
102 Baseline demographics were compared by Mann-Whitney test (age), Fisher’s exact test (gender) or Chi-square
103 test (ethnicity, Charlson co-morbidities and microbiological results). Continuous variables from blood tests
104 were expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR), and patient groups were compared using the non-
                                                                     4

105 parametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine
106 factors that discriminated between CAP and COVID-19. The diagnosis of CAP was the categorical output
107 variable, and blood tests were used as continuous dependent variables in the model, which generated
108 Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC) and areas under the curve (AUC) as a summary statistic. For
109 pre-determined cut-offs, we also calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and
110 positive and negative likelihood ratios. All analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism
111 version 8.

113 Results
114 Defining the discovery cohort
115 We identified 107 CAP, 620 COVID-19 and 188 influenza patients at RFH. 2 patients were excluded due to
116 haematological malignancy. Male gender was overrepresented in COVID-19 (62% in COVID-19 vs 47% and 52%
117 in CAP and influenza respectively), whereas CAP patients were older (median age 72, 68 and 56 in CAP, COVID-
118 19 and influenza respectively). The proportion of Black, Asian, Mixed and Other (non-white) ethnicity patients
119 was higher in COVID-19 compared to CAP and patients with CAP had more comorbidities and identified
120 bacteria in routine microbiological investigations more commonly (table 1).
121 Distinguishing pneumonia from COVID-19
122 We tested the hypothesis that inflammatory markers could discriminate CAP from COVID-19 or influenza by
123 comparing total WCC, its differential cell counts and CRP levels on the day of admission to hospital. Compared
124 to CAP, COVID-19 was associated with significantly lower median WCC (12.48 vs 6.78x106/ml) and neutrophils
125 (9.98 vs 5.37x106/ml (fig 1)). Influenza was also characterised by significantly lower median WCC (7.28x106/ml)
126 and neutrophils (median 5.10x106/ml) than pneumonia (fig 1). Lymphocyte counts did not differ between the
127 groups. CRP was also significantly higher in CAP than in COVID-19, and lower in influenza (median CRP 133.5,
128 86.0 and 31mg/L respectively) (fig 1).
129 All CAP patients were prescribed antibiotics on admission and in two independent surveys of COVID-19
130 patients from RFH, 95/100 (95%) and 104/118 (88%) were prescribed antibiotics to treat a presumptive
131 superadded pulmonary bacterial infection. We hypothesised that CAP and viral infections could be further
132 discriminated by changes in inflammatory markers following initiation of antibiotics [23]. In the RFH cohort,
133 53 (50%) CAP, 331 (53%) COVID-19 and 53 (28%) influenza patients were admitted for >48 hours and had a
134 blood sample collected as part of routine clinical care 48-72 hours into admission (table 1). Differences in
135 inflammatory markers on admission within this subset mirrored that seen in the wider cohort (fig S1). At this
136 later time point, CAP was still characterised by elevated median WCC (9.5 vs 7.01x106/ml), but this difference
                                                                     5

137 was diminished compared to admission (fig S2). Moreover, the difference in CRP between CAP and COVID-19
138 was no longer evident (median CRP 107.5 vs 127.0mg/L) (fig S2). These changes were driven by a greater fall
139 in WCC and CRP for CAP compared to COVID-19 (WCC -2.32 vs -0.17x106/ml and CRP -33 vs +15mg/L
140 respectively) (fig 2).
141 Contribution of multiple variables to discriminate pneumonia from COVID-19
142 Our data suggested that elevated WCC and CRP, as well as a reduction in these parameters at 48-72 hours
143 could discriminate between COVID-19 and CAP. To test this hypothesis, we applied a logistic regression model
144 to the data collected from these two patient groups. We used the diagnosis of CAP as the binary outcome
145 variable and observed that WCC or CRP measurements alone yielded the greatest diagnostic accuracy (fig 3
146 & table 2). The maximal AUC obtained from this analysis was 0.75 (C.I. 0.68-0.83), demonstrating the trade off
147 in sensitivity and specificity when using these variables alone. We also tested whether their combined use
148 would improve the diagnostic accuracy of the model, and observed some improvement in discriminating
149 between CAP from COVID-19 (AUC 0.80, C.I. 0.73-0.87), with no added benefit to also including WCC
150 measurements (fig 3 & table 2).
151 We considered whether the ability of WCC and CRP to discriminate between COVID-19 and CAP was
152 confounded by admission to intensive care unit (ICU). At RFH, 79/331 (23.9%) of COVID-19 patients included
153 in the logistic regression model were admitted to ICU within 72 hours of their admission (table 1). Excluding
154 this subset of patients did not affect the discriminatory power of the model (AUC 0.81, C.I. 0.74-0.88) (table
155 2). We also considered whether COVID-19 patients with microbiological or radiological evidence of a bacterial
156 infection could have confounded discrimination from pneumonia. We identified 16 (4.8%) COVID-19 patients
157 included in the logistic regression model with microbiological results consistent with an active bacterial
158 process (sputum culture positivity with a respiratory pathogen or a non-contaminant bacterial growth in blood
159 cultures (table 1)), and 2 (0.1%) further COVID-19 patients with lobar pneumonia on chest radiograph (table
160 1). Excluding these 18 patients did not alter the differences observed in admission WCC or CRP between CAP
161 and COVID-19 (data not shown), and did not affect the classification accuracy of the remaining patients in the
162 logistic regression model (table 2).
163 Decision making criteria to discriminate bacterial pneumonia and COVID-19
164 We sought to convert our observations into practical decision-making criteria for clinical practice. We
165 generated a series of cut-offs in the variables with greatest discriminatory power between CAP and COVID-19
166 (admission WCC and CRP), and explored the trade off in sensitivity and specificity generated by these alone
167 or in combination (table 3). For cut offs of WCC we used the lower quartile value of the CAP cohort
168 (>8.2x106/ml) and the upper quartile value of the COVID-19 cohort (>9.5x106/ml). For cut offs of CRP we used
169 the lower quartile of the COVID-19 cohort (<-15mg/l) and the upper quartile of the CAP cohort (<3.5mg/l),
                                                                     6

170 rounded to 0mg/L for simplicity This revealed that using CAP-derived quartile cut-offs yielded greater
171 sensitivity, at the expense of specificity. The lower prevalence of CAP in this cohort compared to COVID-19
172 offered a high negative predictive value (>90%). Requiring both a WCC>8.2x106/ml and CRP<0 improved
173 specificity, at the expense of sensitivity. However, as such a strategy would result in many cases of CAP being
174 missed, we also explored using the presence of either parameter to define CAP, yielding a sensitivity of >90%.
175 Although the specificity of this approach was only 43%, the absence of both admission WCC>8.2x106/ml and
176 CRP<0 could still exclude CAP, and by extension bacterial co-infection alongside COVID-19, promoting
177 antibiotic cessation in 142 / 331 (43%) COVID-19 patients from this cohort (table 3).
178 Independent cohort validation
179 To demonstrate reproducibility of our findings, we used independent patient cohorts from a separate hospital,
180 BH, consisting of 169 CAP, 181 COVID-19 and 162 influenza A/B patients. To ensure comparability to the RFH
181 cohort, the patients were identified over the same time periods using identical criteria. Baseline demographic
182 analyses were comparable to those in the RFH cohort (table 4), and 99 (59%), 60 (33%) and 47 (29%) of CAP,
183 COVID-19 and influenza patients respectively were admitted for >48 hours and had a blood sample collected
184 as part of routine clinical care 48-72 hours into admission (table 4).
185 Differences in inflammatory markers within the BH cohort reflected those observed at RFH, with admission
186 WCC and CRP levels being higher in CAP compared to COVID-19 and accompanied by a reduction following 48-
187 72 hours of admission not observed in COVID-19 (fig S3). Applying these parameters into a logistic regression
188 model demonstrated similar discriminatory power of each variable to that seen in RFH patients, and once
189 more an optimal AUC (0.84, C.I. 0.78-0.91) was derived when both admission WCC and CRP were included
190 as variables in the model (table 5). We explored the exclusion of COVID-19 patients included in the logistic
191 regression model that either attended ICU within 72 hours of hospital admission (21/60, 35.0%) or
192 demonstrated microbiological or radiological evidence pneumonia (4/60, 6.7%) (table 5). However, as seen in
193 the RFH cohort, excluding either subset of patients did not significantly affect the discriminatory ability of the
194 logistic regression model (table 5).
195 Finally, we applied the cut-offs independently derived from the RFH cohort on BH patient data, and observed
196 a similar trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Using either admission WCC>8.2x106/ml or CRP<0
197 yielded a CAP sensitivity approaching 95% and negative predictive value of 84% (table 6). Despite the low
198 specificity resulting from these cut-offs, this would still have excluded CAP in 26/56 (46.4%) of COVID-19
199 patients with no microbiological or radiological evidence of pneumonia and admitted for >48hours. 55 (98%)
200 of these patients were prescribed a 5-day course of antibiotics on admission (203 antibiotic days in total).

202 criterium for CAP would have saved 51 antibiotic days overall, a 25% reduction in total antibiotic prescriptions
203 in the BH COVID-19 cohort.
204 Discussion
205 Elevated inflammatory responses, high case fatality and bacterial co-infections observed in influenza
206 contribute to frequent antibiotic prescriptions in COVID-19 [2,4,9,27]. However, radiological findings in COVID-
207 19 are heterogenous [28] and microbiological investigations rarely identify pathogenic bacteria [6–9],
208 precluding reliable identification of co-infection. Therefore, novel approaches to exclude bacterial co-infection
209 in COVID-19 are a research priority to facilitate antimicrobial stewardship efforts [14,29,30].
210 We used patients admitted with CAP prior to the COVID-19 pandemic as a benchmark to define the processes
211 that occur in bacterial pulmonary infections, including bacterial co-infection in COVID-19. This demonstrated
212 that admission WCC (predominantly neutrophils), and CRP can discriminate CAP from both COVID-19 and
213 influenza A/B at a population level. Moreover, WCC and CRP decreased following antibiotic therapy in
214 pneumonia, but not in viral infections. We used these observations to construct a model and decision-making
215 criteria to assist with excluding bacterial co-infection in many cases of COVID-19. We propose that the absence
216 of both admission WCC >8.2x106/ml and a fall in CRP would support stopping antibiotics in almost 50% of
217 COVID-19 patients during their admission, reducing total antibiotic prescriptions in this population by up to
218 25%. This approach would exceed most antimicrobial stewardship achievements [29,30], and reduce selection
219 for antibiotic resistant bacteria during this pandemic [12,14].
220 The combination of selected cut-offs yielded the greatest sensitivity for CAP, ensuring ongoing antibiotic
221 treatment where needed, but came at the expense of specificity. Therefore, these criteria remain permissive
222 to excessive antibiotic prescribing in COVID-19, particularly on admission to hospital. PCT can discriminate
223 bacterial from some viral respiratory tract infections [21,22], but has not been systematically compared
224 between bacterial pneumonia and COVID-19. Unfortunately, we could not investigate PCT as it was not
225 measured routinely in our CAP cohorts. Future studies should also assess, alongside admission WCC and CRP,
226 the discriminatory capacity of PCT, D-dimers [9,22,31], and other novel biomarkers, such as transcriptional
227 signatures that quantify inflammatory cytokine activity [32] or those that discriminate bacterial from viral
228 infections [33].
229 The large, standardised populations studied, use of routinely available clinical investigations, and the
230 reproducibility of our findings in an independent validation cohort population are key strengths of our study.
231 We were also able to convert population level findings into practical diagnostic criteria that can be used in
232 generalised clinical settings. The cut-offs used were derived from a separate population in which they were
233 tested, adding scientific validity to our conclusions, but does not negate individual care providers determining
                                                                     8

234 the distribution of admission WCC in their own cases of CAP to define institution-specific IQR cut-offs. In
235 addition, our criteria should not be considered in isolation from clinical decision making. Clinical improvement,
236 reduced supplemental oxygen requirement, and the absence of consolidation on chest radiograph in COVID-
237 19 patients may all contribute to excluding bacterial co-infection and could be used alongside the WCC and
238 CRP criteria to support cessation of antibiotics.
239 Our study has some notable limitations. First, the populations were identified at non-overlapping times, due
240 to the disproportionate prevalence of COVID-19 cases in 2020. We attempted to mitigate for the enforced use
241 of historical pneumonia and influenza comparator groups by identifying these patients over the same months
242 of 2019 as COVID-19 cases in 2020. We also did not collect clinical severity or outcome data for the patients,
243 and thus we cannot measure a direct impact on prognosis. Second, we used a radiological, but not
244 microbiological, definition of pneumonia, and although standardised, it is possible that some pneumonia cases
245 had non-bacterial aetiology. Third, we inferred that bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 shares pathophysiology
246 and inflammatory marker responses with CAP in the absence of COVID-19. This hypothesis remains untested
247 but is supported by the divergent inflammatory marker responses observed between most COVID-19 and CAP
248 patients. Fourth, we did not include suspected COVID-19 patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 results, therefore
249 our findings may not be applicable to this cohort. Finally, we focused on patient assessments made within 72
250 hours of admission, and thus our decision-making tools are not applicable to patients discharged before this
251 time or those with prolonged hospital admissions.
252 In conclusion, we demonstrate that routine clinical parameters, admission WCC and changes in CRP following
253 antibiotic administration, can be translated into a set of diagnostic criteria that can exclude bacterial co-
254 infection in up to half of COVID-19 patients. The routine nature of the investigations required mean that, even
255 in the context of a pandemic, this approach can form the basis of protocols to assist reductions in unnecessary
256 antibiotic prescriptions for viral infections, minimising drug-associated adverse effects and reducing
257 development of antimicrobial resistance.
