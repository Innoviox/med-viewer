  18      Abstract
  19      There is a lack of COVID-19 adjusted case fatality risk (aCFR) estimates and information on
  20      states with high aCFR. State-specific aCFRs were estimated, using 13-day lag for fatality. To
  21      estimate country-level aCFR, state estimates were meta-analysed. Multiple correspondence
  22      analyses (MCA), followed by univariable logistic regression, were conducted to understand
  23      the association between aCFR and geodemographic, health and social indicators. Based on
  24      health indicators, states likely to report a higher aCFR were identified. Using random- and
  25      fixed-effects models, the aCFRs in India were 1.42 (95% CI 1.19 – 1.70) and 2.97 (95% CI
  26      2.94 – 3.00), respectively. The aCFR was grouped with the incidence of diabetes,
  27      hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and acute respiratory infections in the first and second
  28      dimensions of MCA. The current study demonstrated the value of using meta-analysis to
  29      estimate aCFR. To decrease COVID-19 associated fatalities, states estimated to have a high
  30      aCFR must take steps to reduce co-morbidities.
                                                                       2

  31      Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in
  32      Wuhan, China in December 2019 (1). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progressed
  33      rapidly into a serious pandemic and within 10 months, despite mitigation efforts, > 30M
  34      cumulative cases and 0.95M deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported worldwide (2).
  35      Furthermore, an unmitigated outbreak was estimated to cause ~ 7B infections and ~40 M
  36      deaths worldwide in 2020 (3).
  37      SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via respiratory droplets and aerosols from infected individuals
  38      (4, 5). Virus particles present in small droplets released while speaking or coughing can
  39      remain viable and infectious in aerosols for 3 hours (6, 7). These virus particles can be
  40      transmitted directly or by contact transfer via contaminated hands (8). Furthermore,
  41      transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been linked to temperature and humidity (9, 10).
  42      COVID-19 symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, pneumonia and other
  43      respiratory tract symptoms, and can progress to death (11, 12). The median incubation period
  44      is 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days) and 97.5% will develop symptoms within 11.5 days
  45      (95% CI 8.2 – 15.6 days) of infection (13). Only ~1% of cases will develop symptoms after
  46      14 days of active monitoring or quarantine (13).
  47      Case fatality risk (CFR) estimates for COVID-19 vary across countries and over time. As of 5
  48      March 2020, a CFR of 3.5% was reported from China, 4.2% was reported across 82
  49      countries/territories, and 0.6% from a cruise ship (after accounting for a lag time for fatality)
  50      (14). On 17 March 2020, a CFR of 7.2% was reported from Italy (15). A CFR of 5.65% (after
  51      accounting for right-censoring) was reported in mainland China, based on data collected from
  52      29 December 2019 to 17 April 2020 (16). Case fatality rates of 1.2% in Germany (17), 9% in
  53      Spain, 11.9% in Italy, 8.6% in the Netherlands, 7.1% in France and 8% in the UK, have been
  54      reported across varying intervals (18). Thus, there appears to be great variability among CFR
  55      estimates, from < 1 to > 10%.
                                                                       3

  56      COVID-19 prognosis and progression vary among individuals. Diabetes has been reported to
  57      be a risk factor for a poor COVID-19 prognosis (19). Coronary artery disease, heart failure,
  58      cardiac arrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, current smoking and > 65 years
  59      of age were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among COVID-19
  60      hospitalized patients (20). A higher frequency of obesity was reported in intensive care
  61      COVID-19 patients (21).
  62      The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported on 30 January 2020 (22). As of 22
  63      September 2020, the country had reported 5,562,663 cumulative cases, a total of 88,935
  64      deaths and >65M tests conducted (23). The disease has been reported in all states and union-
  65      territories. To our knowledge, state-specific CFRs (after accounting for a lag-time for fatality)
  66      and the case fatality risk at the country level using a meta-analysis approach have not been
  67      reported. In addition, little is known about the risk factors associated with COVID-19 CFR in
  68      India. Therefore, our objectives were to estimate the aCFR for COVID-19 and its association
  69      with various health and social indicators in India.
  70      Methods
  71      Source of data
  72      COVID-19 case and death data
  73      State/Union territory-specific COVID-19 cumulative case (27 July 2020 – 08:00 AM IST)
  74      and death (27 July 2020 – 08:00 AM IST and 09 August 2020 – 08:00 AM IST) time-series
  75      data were extracted from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Indian Council for
  76      Medical Research, Government of India websites (23).
  77      Combined data for the union territories Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are presented (old
  78      state of Jammu and Kashmir), as other health and social indicators were only available for the
  79      old state of Jammu and Kashmir. No data were available for UT of Lakshadweep.
  80      Furthermore, individual data for the two UTs Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu
                                                                       4

  81      were not available and were therefore excluded. Mizoram state had limited cases with no
  82      deaths reported; therefore, this state was also excluded from the analysis. The final dataset
  83      had information on 32 states/union territories (Fig. 1).
  84      State/UT-specific parameters
  85      Data for 17 state-specific geodemographic (n=4), socio-economic (n=1), health and
  86      comorbidity-related (n=12) factors were collected (Table 1). Information on the 2016
  87      projected total human population and number of persons who attended Non-communicable
  88      disease (NCD) clinics in 2018 were also collected to derive estimates per 10,000 population
  89      (Table 1).
  90      Database development
  91      Annual incidence of malaria, acute respiratory infection, and pneumonia per 10,000 human
  92      population were estimated by dividing the total number of cases reported due to malaria,
  93      acute respiratory infection, and pneumonia in 2017 by the projected human population in
  94      2016, and finally multiplied by 10,000.
  95      Similarly, incidence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and common
  96      cancers (from those who attended NCD clinics) were divided by the total number of persons
  97      attending NCD clinics and finally multiplied by 10,000 to estimate number of patients
  98      diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and common cancers
  99      per 10,000 population that visited NCD clinics.
 100      Statistical analyses
 101      Statistical analyses were conducted using R (R statistical package version 3.4.0, R
 102      Development Core Team [2015], http://www.r-project.org).
 103      Adjusted case fatality risk (aCFR)
 104      State-specific aCFR was estimated using a lag time for fatality. We used a previously
 105      reported median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (24). The number of
                                                                       5

 106      COVID-19 cumulative cases on 27 July 2020 was used as the denominator value. Based on
 107      Wilson, Kvalsvig (14), we assumed that half of the additional cumulative reported deaths on
 108      9 August 2020 corresponded to cases reported on 27 July. As noted, this approach is simple,
 109      albeit likely to be modified or replaced accurate studies to overcome associated limitations
 110      become available (14).
 111      Finally, the aCFR (proportion of cumulative deaths to cumulative cases) was estimated via
 112      meta-analysis using the R function metaprop, with inverse-variance weighting. Separate
 113      estimates using both fixed- and random-effects models are presented (25). Proportions were
 114      logit transformed.
 115      Predictors and outcome
 116      Information on the 17 state-specific geodemographic, social, health and comorbidity-related
 117      factors as key predictors were collected. State-specific aCFR was used as the outcome
 118      variable.
 119      Descriptive analyses
 120      Descriptive analyses were performed and data were tested for the assumptions of linearity
 121      and normality. Initially, a variable was log-transformed if the assumption of normality was
 122      not met. Later, non-linear variables were converted into categorical variables using quartiles
 123      for further analysis. Fisher’s Exact test was used to determine the association between
 124      categorical predictor variables.
 125      Multiple correspondence analyses
 126      Due to expected associations among categorical predictor variables, multiple correspondence
 127      analysis (MCA) was conducted to determine potential groupings of predictor variables with
 128      the aCFR. For the purpose of MCA, categorical predictor variables were re-categorised using
 129      their medians and converted into dichotomous low- or high-value predictor variables.
                                                                       6

 130      Adjusted CFR was also dichotomised as low versus high aCFR before conducting the MCA.
 131      States with missing values were excluded from the MCA.
 132       Univariable logistic regression
 133      Predictor variables grouped with aCFR (in the same quadrant as the group centroid in the
 134      first- and second dimensions following MCA) were assessed using univariable linear
 135      regression (p ≤ 0.05). In addition, incidence of patients with stroke that visited NCD clinics
 136      was also assessed as it was placed closer to the variable aCFR in the MCA (albeit in a
 137      different quadrant). Dichotomised aCFR was used as the outcome variable and the selected
 138      geodemographic and health indicators (after categorising by their quartiles) as key predictors.
 139      Identification of states with high aCFR
 140      Based on the subjective evaluation of the univariable analysis (using significant predictor
 141      variables), states having a low, medium, or high aCFR were determined. The predictor
 142      quartile having the lowest odds ratio was assigned a score of 1 and that of the highest odds
 143      ratio was assigned a score of 4. Predictor quartiles having similar odds ratios were assigned
 144      average scores for their respective rank quartiles. Scores of all the significant predictors were
 145      combined to produce an overall risk score of aCFR. States having scores of 0–8, 8–16 and
 146      16–24 were categorised as low, medium, and high risk aCFR states. Choropleth maps
 147      describing risk score of aCFR for the Indian states were generated.
 148      Results
 149      Case fatality risk
 150      Overall, in the selected states/union territories by 27 July 2020 1,434,178 cumulative
 151      COVID-19 cases had been reported, whereas by 9 August 2020 43,377 deaths had been
 152      reported. Using the random-effects model and meta-analysis, the aCFR (%) was estimated to
 153      be 1.42 (95% CI 1.19 – 1.70). Furthermore, using the fixed-effects model and meta-analysis,
 154      the aCFR was estimated to be 2.97 (95% CI 2.94 – 3.00). Heterogeneity was very high at
                                                                       7

 155      99.57% (p < 0.001) in the effect of sizes in both fixed- and random-effect models (Fig. 1).
 156      Based on high heterogeneity, random-effects model estimates were more likely to be
 157      representative of the true aCFR for India.
 158      Multivariable correspondence analysis
 159      Case fatality risk grouped with certain geodemographic and health indicators in the first and
 160      second dimensions of MCA (Fig. 2); potentially associated variables listed (Table 2).
 161      Grouping of aCFR with the incidence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and
 162      acute respiratory infections was apparent in the first and second dimensions of the multiple
 163      correspondence analysis.
 164      Univariable analysis
 165      Univariable analysis revealed that the 2011 proportion of urban population, 2017 incidence of
 166      diabetes, 2017 incidence of hypertension, 2017 incidence of cardiovascular diseases, 2017
 167      incidence of stroke, and 2017 incidence of pneumonia were positively correlated with
 168      COVID-19 aCFR (Table 2).
 169      Identification of states with high aCFR
 170      Based on the predictor variables, we categorised 10, 17 and 1 Indian states as likely to have a
 171      high, medium, and low aCFR risk, respectively (Fig. 3, Table 3).
 172      Discussion
 173      To our knowledge, the aCFR, using meta-analysis and a lag time for fatality using state-
 174      specific data, has not been estimated for India or many other countries. However, this will
 175      help inform COVID-19 response in the country. Similarly, identifying states with high CFR
 176      will help to better allocate health resources across states and enhance preparedness levels in
 177      these states.
 178      Accurate estimation of CFR is a serious challenge worldwide. We used a previously reported
 179      median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death and accounted for half of the deaths
                                                                       8

 180      during this interval in aCFR estimations. Any bias in this estimate may have under- or over-
 181      estimated the COVID-19 aCFR in India. However, we believe this estimate to be much more
 182      accurate than the crude CFR estimations using same day COVID-19 case and death data. We
 183      agreed with a previous study that this approach is simple, albeit likely to be superseded when
 184      accurate studies to overcome associated limitations become available (14). In addition,
 185      asymptomatic cases, testing criteria and capacity further complicate COVID-19 case
 186      estimations.
 187      Using the random- and fixed-effect models, the estimated aCFR was 1.42 (95% CI 1.19 –
 188      1.70) and 2.97 (95% CI 2.94 – 3.00), respectively. Due to high heterogeneity, estimates using
 189      the random-effects model were more likely to represent the true aCFR for India. Previous
 190      studies used random-effect models to estimate the CFR of COVID-19 (26, 27) or presented
 191      CFR using both random-effects and fixed-effect models (28). Using a random effects model,
 192      we ensured that states with high numbers of cases and deaths received more weight compared
 193      to states with fewer cases and deaths.
 194      For India, the aCFR appeared to be lower than in many European countries. This might be
 195      due to the fact that only 6.38% of the population in India was above 65 years of age in 2019
 196      (29). Elderly people (>60 years) have been reported to be at a higher risk of death due to
 197      COVID-19 (30, 31). However, many other health and social indicators, changes in the
 198      virulence of SARS-CoV2 in regions over time, and country-specific COVID-19 response
 199      indicators may be associated with CFR, and this needs to be investigated.
 200      Heterogeneity was as high as 99.57% in the effect sizes in state-specific aCFRs (both fixed-
 201      and random-effect models), perhaps due to differences in state-specific sub-populations,
 202      health facilities, infrastructure hospital care and COVID-19 testing protocols. In addition,
 203      specific states might be in different phases of the COVID-19 epidemic, as the CFR has varied
 204      during the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic (28). High heterogeneity needs to be
                                                                       9

 205      further investigated; regardless, the current estimates suggest uncertainty of aCFR point
 206      estimates.
 207      Multiple correspondence analyses and univariable logistic regression were used to summarise
 208      associations between state-specific aCFR and several geodemography, social and health
 209      indicators. Based on these analyses, health indicators such as incidence of diabetes,
 210      hypertension, stroke and cardiovascular diseases were associated with the aCFR in India,
 211      consistent with previous studies in other countries (19, 20).
 212      The current study had some limitations. Differences in COVID-19 testing and hospital care
 213      may have caused differences in aCFR at the state level. Although health indicators were
 214      estimated from NCD clinic data, there may be differences among states in the population that
 215      visit NCD clinics. The Government of India has NCD clinics for screening and early
 216      diagnosis of NCDs under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer,
 217      Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke. As of March 2020, 665 District NCD Cells,
 218      637 District NCD Clinics, 4472 CHC NCD Clinics, 181 Cardiac Care Units and 218 Day
 219      Care Units were reported to be functional (32). Overall, 35.72M patients have been reported
 220      to attend NCD clinics in 2017 (33). In addition, the role of many health indicators, e.g.
 221      obesity, could not be evaluated. Furthermore, we could not account for the migration between
 222      the states. That COVID-19 testing capacity varies across states may have influenced the
 223      aCFR estimations in the current study. Lastly, the risk factor investigation at the state level
 224      may not be applicable at the individual level. Despite these shortcomings, we believe the
 225      aCFR and the risk factor investigation in the current study to be sufficiently valid to inform
 226      COVID-19 response in India and populations in similar settings.
