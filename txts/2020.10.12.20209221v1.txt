    Abstract
    Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) has long been suspected to be involved
    in the etiology of Crohn’s disease (CD). An obligate intracellular pathogen, MAP persists and
    influences host macrophages. The primary goals of this study were to assess the degree of viable
    culturable MAP bacteremia in humans, definite identification of the organisms cultured and to
    assess if CD patients have a significantly higher rate of MAP infection compared to controls. A
    secondary goal was to compare the efficacy of three culture methods plus a phage assay and four
    antibody assays performed in separate laboratories, to detect MAP from the parallel samples.
    Culture and serological MAP testing was performed blind on whole blood samples obtained from
    201 subjects including 61 CD patients, two patients with CD and concurrent ulcerative colitis
    (UC), 14 patients with UC only and 140 non-CD controls. Viable MAP bacteremia was detected
    in a significant number of study subjects across all groups. This included Pozzato culture (124/201
    or 62% of all subjects, 35/61 or 57% of CD patients), Phage assay (113/201 or 56% of all subjects,
    28/61 or 46% of CD patients), TiKa culture (64/201 or 32% of all subjects, 22/61 or 36% of CD
    patients) and MGIT culture (36/201 or 18% of all subjects, 15/61 or 25% of CD patients). A link
    between MAP detection and CD was observed with MGIT culture and one of the antibody methods
    (Hsp65) confirming previous studies. Other detection methods showed no association between any
    of the groups tested. Nine subjects with positive Phage assay (8/9) or MAP culture (1/9) were
    again positive with the Phage assay one year later. This study highlights viable MAP bacteremia
    is widespread in the study population including CD patients, those with other autoimmune
    conditions and asymptomatic healthy subjects.

    1. Introduction:
        Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is accepted as the cause of Johne’s
    Disease (JD) [1], a chronic diarrheal wasting disease of cattle and a wasting disease in sheep and
    goats[2] and has long been suspected to be involved in the etiology of Crohn’s Disease (CD), an
    inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of humans[3]. MAP and/or CD are also associated with many
    other autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis [4-13], type I diabetes mellitus [14-19],
    rheumatoid arthritis [20-22], Sjogren’s syndrome [23], asymmetric lateral sclerosis [24], systemic
    sclerosis, celiac disease [25], depression [26], thyroiditis [27], and the neurodegenerative diseases
    including Alzheimer’s disease [28] and Parkinson’s disease [29]. A diarrheal/wasting illness
    associated with infection with MAP has also been reported in non-human primates [30].
        Viable MAP is present in our food, potable water and can be isolated from commercially
    available pasteurized milk [31,32] with MAP being identified in 2.7% of retail pasteurized milk
    samples purchased in Wisconsin, Minnesota and California, USA [31]. It is highly likely therefore
    that humans are regularly exposed to this animal pathogen. Screening of human sera with a MAP
    specific antibody assay has found evidence of MAP specific immune recognition in subjects with
    a range of underlying diseases including patients with CD and asymptomatic controls [33].
    Previous meta-analyses looking predominantly at molecular detection methods also indicated a
    trend for studies showing a significantly higher percentage of MAP detection in samples from
    patients with CD, compared to non IBD controls [34,35]. However, problems and controversy in
    proving the association of MAP with any of these conditions has been hampered by definitive and
    reproducible methods able to detect and grow MAP from humans. Individual smaller studies have
    cultured MAP from human blood including significantly greater success in CD patients than from
    controls [36,37]. The method used (MGIT ParaTB culture tubes) was not optimal however,
    requiring three to six months of incubation and being of relatively low reproducibility. In
    accordance with consensus recommendations from the MAP conference held at Temple University
    in March 2017, this study was undertaken to examine alternative approaches able to detect, isolate
    and/or culture MAP from human blood samples [38].
        The primary goals of the study were to assess the degree of viable culturable MAP bacteraemia
    in a test human population, definite identification of the organisms cultured and to determine the
    relative predominance of MAP in CD patients compared to controls, which included several non-
    CD subjects with various autoimmune diseases. A secondary goal included parallel evaluation of
    two culture-based approaches developed in different laboratories (TiKa culture and Pozzato
    culture), a rapid phage amplification detection method combined with the existing MGIT culture
    method, and a series of MAP specific antibody tests developed at several other laboratories. Lastly
    to establish a degree of reliability in the results, selected subjects showing initial positive MAP
    detection were also followed up with a repeat test one year later.
    2. Materials and methods:
    2.1 Study design and participants
           The study protocol was reviewed on October 20, 2017 by the Temple University IRB (IRB
    protocol # 24790). This case-control study included 201 subjects-61 patients with CD and 140

    non-CD controls. The non-CD control group included 16 patients with UC and various other
    autoimmune diseases. The first 159 subjects in the study were recruited from the practice of a
    gastroenterologist in Winter Park, Florida, Dr. Ira Shafran. In addition, 42 of the subjects were
    recruited from the Human Paratuberculosis Foundation website (www.humanpara.org) and the
    phlebotomy of the second group was performed at a site in New York City. A single blood
    collection was performed on 192 subjects during May through August 2018. For 9 of the subjects
    a second blood sample was obtained in August 2019 to determine if they had a transient or
    persistent MAP infection. Selection of these subjects was based on an initial positive phage assay
    and for the availability to donate a second sample one year later in Philadelphia. One of these
    subjects had chronic thyroiditis and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), three had chronic thyroiditis,
    four subjects were asymptomatic and healthy, and one had IBS.
    2.2 Diagnosis and diagnostic categorization
           The subjects completed a consent form and a questionnaire about their medical history and
    BCG status. The patients with CD or UC also completed an additional questionnaire during
    enrollment to assess the modified Harvey Bradshaw index (HBI). All subject information was kept
    confidential in accordance with standard medical practice.
    2.3 Procedures
            Blood samples were collected from all 201 participants at enrollment in EDTA blood
    collection tubes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)/buffy coat specimens were
    prepared from the whole blood samples and then shipped by courier to each of the laboratories
    performing the cultures (Bull and Grant laboratories in London and Belfast, UK, respectively, and
    Naser laboratory in Florida, USA). The courier delivery time to the Bull and Grant laboratories
    was subject to inconsistently applied international customs regulations and thus ranged from 3 to
    7 days while the courier delivery time to the Naser laboratory was one day. The plasma from the
    blood samples was collected and frozen at -80oC until serology testing was performed later. All
    samples were identified by a study number and the laboratory scientists were blinded to all clinical
    information, diagnoses, and personal identifiers.
    2.3.1 MGIT culture:
            Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from the EDTA buffy coats were inoculated into
    BACTEC MGIT ParaTB medium with supplements (OADC and mycobactin J as detailed above)
    and incubated for 6 months at 37oC. After incubation, the MGIT culture was centrifuged, DNA
    extracted from the pellet, and nested IS900 PCR was performed as described [36]. Subcultures were
    made on all PCR-positive MGIT cultures to attempt recovery of MAP in pure culture.
    2.3.2      TiKa culture:
           Buffy coats transported in Middlebrook 7H9 transport media were centrifuged at 800 × g
    for 10 min at RT and the pellet re-suspended in 10 ml freshly prepared TiKa-KiC [39]
    decontamination cocktail then incubated at 37°C for 20-24 h with shaking (150 rpm). Samples
    were centrifuged at 2500 × g for 15 min at RT, pellets re-suspended in 1 ml recovery medium
    (Pozzato culture) plus TiKa supplements A (1μg/ml), M1, M2 and M3 (1 µl/ml)) and incubated

    37°C for 2 days. Samples were then added to MGIT culture tubes supplemented with PANTA plus
    Mycobactin J (2 µg/ml) and TiKa supplement A (1 µg/ml) and incubated at 37°C for up to 4
    months. Cultures showing visible growth were centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min at RT and pellets
    subcultured on to solid Pozzato culture (1.5% agar) in 24 well plates then overlaid with semi-solid
    Pozzato culture 0.75% agar containing TiKa supplement A (1μg/ml), sealed with gas permeable
    membrane and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. MAP DNA was extracted from colonies as
    previously described [40]. Samples were deemed MAP positive if IS900 and F57 PCR positive
    biomass was obtained.
    2.3.3      Pozzato Culture and Phage amplification assay:
            PBMC samples were centrifuged (2500 × g for 15 min) and resuspended in 1 ml
    Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with 10 % OADC (both Difco) and 2 mM CaCl2 (Sigma).
    The phage amplification assay and Pozzato culture were performed as described previously [41-
    44]. Briefly, following a 15 min incubation at RT and a thorough vortex, 500 µl of each PBMC
    sample was inoculated into a screw cap glass culture tube containing 4 ml modified 7H9 medium,
    PANTA antibiotic supplement, and mycobactin J, as described by Pozzato et al. [42] but with no
    egg yolk added (referred to as ‘Pozzato culture’) [43]. The second 500 µl of each PBMC sample
    was subjected to the optimized phage amplification assay [44], which proceeded as follows: 108
    D29 mycobacteriophages were added to each 1 ml test sample to infect any MAP cells present,
    and samples were incubated at 37oC. After 2 h, the extraneous seed phages were inactivated by
    treatment with virucide (final concentration 10 mM ferrous ammonium sulphate) for 10 min, and
    then the sample was diluted with 5 ml 7H9/OADC/ CaCl2 (2mM) broth. Incubation of samples
    proceeded until a total of 3.5 h had elapsed since addition of phages, at which point the entire
    sample was plated with Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155 sensor cells and 5 ml molten
    Middlebrook 7H9 agar in Petri dishes. Once solidified, agar plates were incubated overnight at
    37oC and examined next day for evidence of zones of clearing (‘plaques’), the presence of which
    would be indicative of the viable mycobacteria in the sample, A PMBC sample was deemed MAP
    culture positive if IS900 and F57 PCR positive biomass (broth pellet or colony on Herrold’s egg
    yolk-mycobactin J (HEYM) was obtained.
    2.3.4      MAP antibody assay:
            Plasma samples for each patient were assayed using the IDEXX Mycobacterium
    paratuberculosis antibody test kit for detection of antibody to MAP in bovine serum, plasma and
    milk. This kit was adapted for human use as described previously [45]. Human plasma controls
    optical density (OD) values were used to calculate sample/positive (S/P) ratios and interpret the
    assay.
    2.3.5 PtpA and PknG ELISA test:

           The antibodies against virulence factors secreted by MAP during infections were measured
    in plasma specimens as described previously [46,47]. These antigens included the protein tyrosine
    phosphatase PtpA and the protein kinase G PknG [47,48]. Recombinant PtpA and PknG were
    produced in M. smegmatis and according to published procedures [47,48].

    2.3.6 Hsp65 antibody assay:
           Hsp65 antibody from the blood was measured by direct ELISA assays described previously
    [23]. Recombinant Hsp65 from Mycobacterium avium subspecies hominissuis (MAH) was
    produced at GenScript Corp (https://www.genscript.com/) through contract work, and used to coat
    the 96-well plate.
    2.3.7 WGS:

            One MAP isolate from a single subject, primarily isolated using TiKa culture was whole
    genome sequenced. Briefly, three colonies were collected from Pozzato semi-solid culture washed
    once in TE x1 buffer (Tris HCl-EDTA pH8, Sigma, UK), killed by heating at 98˚C for 30 mins in
    TE x1, then gDNA extracted using the QiaPrep DNA kit (Qiagen, UK) according to
    manufacturer’s instructions. Whole genome sequencing was as previously described [49]. DNA
    concentration and integrity were determined using Qubit High Sensitivity DNA assay (Life
    Technologies, UK) and Agilent Tapestation 2100 using a genomic screentape respectively. Library
    preparation and sample indexing was undertaken using NexteraXT DNA according to the
    manufacturer’s instructions followed by bead-based normalisation and pooling with other libraries
    being sequenced. Sequencing was performed using Illumina v3 chemistry using 2 x 300 bp paired-
    end reads and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq Sequence reads were mapped to the MAP reference
    genome (RefSeq accession: NC_002944.2) using bwa mem v0.7.3a-r367 [50], alignments were
    sorted, duplicates were removed with samtools v0.1.19 [51] and site statistics generated using
    samtools mpileup. The compiled genome was mapped against other mycobacteria using NCBI
    Sequence Viewer (Version 3.36.0, NCBI, USA) and Snapgene (Version 4.3.11, GSL Biotech,
    USA).

    2.4 Data Analyses and Statistical Methods:
             Data were expressed as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and mean ±
    standard deviation (SD) and/or median (range or quartile range) for continuous variables.
    Associations between potential risk factors or assay methods of interest and select disease status
    (i.e., CD or CD+UC) were evaluated using the Fisher’s exact test for two groups and Wald test for
    a continuous variable. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed on the select
    diseases to explore their association with or predictability of the disease using different assay
    methods (culture, antibodies or both) when other potential risk factors or confounding variables
    such as age and gender are adjusted in the regression model. To define a cutoff value of a
    continuous covariate or an assay variable for inclusion in a logistic regression model in predicting
    a patient's outcome, the cutoff was chosen to achieve an optimal classification criterion based on
    the Euclidean distance method. Both the continuous and dichotomized versions of continuous
    variables were included in the logistic regression model as candidate variables in a stepwise
    variable selection procedure. A stay probability of 0.10 and entry probability of 0.25 were
    employed to arrive at a final regression model. Therefore, variables with non-significant predictive
    abilities for a disease state were dropped from the multivariable logistic regression model to keep
    the model parsimonious. Age and sex were included in all regression models a priori. Both raw
    and adjusted odds ratios of having CD or CD+UC and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were

    reported whenever appropriate. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
    SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for all the data analyses.
    3. Results:
            The subject demographic data by subgroups for the study appears in Table 1. The median
    patient age and age ranges are presented in addition to the mean age and standard deviation because
    the data is asymmetric, and this approach is favored for asymmetric distributions such as age data.
    In the study, the non-CD patients appeared to be slightly older than the CD patients (median: 57.5
    vs. 47 years old) and have a similar gender composition (59% vs. 54% females).
            The analytical sensitivities (the ability of the method to detect the organism, rather than
    clinical sensitivity, which is the ability of the test to detect disease) of the culture methods for
    viable MAP bacteremia in order of the highest to lowest are: 1) Pozzato culture (124/201 or 62%
    of all subjects, 35/61 or 57% of CD patients), 2) Phage assay (113/201 or 56% of all subjects,
    28/61 or 46% of CD patients), 3) TiKa culture (64/201 or 32% of all subjects, 22/61 or 36% of CD
    patients) and 4) MGIT culture (36/201 or 18% of all subjects, 15/61 or 25% of CD patients). These
    results are summarized in Table 2. Results are reported as number and % of subjects in each
    category, with subject numbers in parentheses for CD and UC only patients. * Two CD patients
    also had diagnosis of UC. **Non-CD category includes the 14 UC only subjects. †Two subjects
    had missing TiKa culture results.
            Interrelationships between results of the three liquid culture methods (MGIT, TiKa and
    Pozzato) are illustrated in Figure 1. Supplemental data show numbers of plaques observed in CD
    patients and non-CD control (Supplementary Figure 1 and 2).
            Table 3 depicts the association of clinically diagnosed CD patients with various categorical
    variables of interest. Of note, the younger age group (≤52 years old) seemed to be more likely to
    have CD when compared to the older age group (>52 years old) (OR (95% CI): 2.66 (1.42, 4.99);
    p=0.003). Among all assay methods, a negative Hsp65 antibody assay <0.74 appeared to
    differentiate CD from non-CD cases (p=0.06 and 0.02, see Table 3). Figure 2 shows the
    comparison of MAP detected by all cultural and serological methods among the subjects.
            To investigate the independent relationships of the culture and the serologic methods with
    the presence of MAP and the clinical diagnosis in subjects i.e., CD or CD+ UC vs. (non-CD or
    non-CD nor UC), a multivariable logistic regression model was used for association analyses. The
    significant findings regarding associations with MAP culture and/or antibody data are provided
    using the odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for having CD or having either CD
    or UC and a p-value. The OR data for all culture methods is presented adjusted for age and gender
    in Table 4, which is more robust than the unadjusted/marginal odds ratio data that is included in
    Table 3.
            The associated p-value was 0.037 with an OR (95% CI) of 2.36 (1.06, 5.28) for the MGIT
    culture for MAP positivity corresponding to CD patients and this associated p-value supports the
    predictive power of this culture method. This was also true when UC subjects were included along
    with the CD subjects in the analysis and the result of this analysis was a p-value of 0.006 and

    adjusted OR (95% CI) of 3.19 (1.40, 7.23) for having CD+UC when comparing MGIT culture
    positive to negative subjects.
            The TiKa culture showed a significant association (data not included) for positive MAP
    cultures, but the TiKa, Phage assay and Pozzato culture methods did not reach the statistical
    significance at 0.10. Therefore, the preceding methods did not make the final model predicting the
    presence of CD in our study. Nonetheless, the Phage assay and Pozzato culture methods detected
    a higher proportion of MAP infections in non-CD/UC cohort while TiKa culture had a reverse
    trend similar to the one exhibited by the MGIT culture method (see Table 2).
            Amongst the several serology tests, the highest and only significant correlation to the
    presence of CD occurred with the Hsp65 antibody. At a cutoff value of 0.74, this method had the
    best ability to discriminate between CD patients and non-CD subjects (adjusted OR (95% CI) of
    having CD comparing Hsp65 Ab > 0.74 vs. Hsp65 Ab ≤ 0.74: 2.40 (1.25, 4.61); p-value 0.009;
    Table 4). The PknG antibody also had a significant negative correlation to the presence of CD/UC
    in our patients as compared to the non-CD/UC subjects (adjusted OR (95% CI) of having CD/UC
    comparing PknG negatives to positives: 2.18 (1.12, 4.23); p-value: 0.022. Spearman correlation
    showed that the Hsp65 antibody had a weak correlation with the HBI (Spearman coefficient=0.28,
    p=0.03) and the Phage Plaque counts showed a very weak correlation with the HBI (Spearman
    coefficient =0.12, p=0.37) among 60 CD patients who had such data. It is worth noting that the
    range of the HBI in the study population was limited and few patients had an HBI greater than 5.
             The MGIT culture and the Hsp65 antibody assay were the best discriminators between the
    CD patients and the non-CD subjects for the study population, both each in its individual own
    (culture or antibody) category and together independently in the culture and antibody combined
    set, after having adjusted for age and sex (and each other in the latter case) (see Table 4). If we
    combine all three culture methods into one category, i.e. culture is positive if any one of the three
    cultures methods are positive and negative if otherwise, then the overall agreement between this
    category and Phage assay achieved a rate of 75% with an exact 95% CI of (68%, 80%). The kappa
    statistic (SE) for agreement between the two diagnostic methods was 0.26 (0.08) with a 95% CI
    of (0.11, 0.42), showing the strength of agreement as fair (Table 5).
             Viable MAP bacteremia was also detected in patients with autoimmune conditions who
    did not have either CD or UC: 1) Pozzato culture (33/57 or 58%), 2) Phage assay (36/57 or 63%),
    3) TiKa culture (19/56 or 34%) and 4) MGIT culture (9/57 or 16%). All 9 subjects who had an
    initial positive MAP culture (8/9 by Phage assay) were positive on the second Phage assay from a
    second blood sample obtained one year later.
           Definite identification of one viable isolate recovered from the blood of a single subject
    with IBS was confirmed as MAP by whole genome sequencing (WGS) and an assembled
    contiguous sequence compared with MAP isolates in a large genome bank. The isolate phage,
    TiKa culture isolate and WGS dendrogram are shown in Figure 3, 4 and 5, respectively. WGS will
    be performed on 40 additional MAP culture isolates from this study and reported as an addendum.

    Discussion:
            This study definitively demonstrates viable MAP organisms to be present in the blood of a
    significantly high number of humans and that this state of infection can be persistent. Viable MAP
    bacteremia was found to not be exclusive to any one of the groups tested including patients with
    CD, UC, CD with UC, a range of other autoimmune diseases or asymptomatic subjects.
            The study has compared three culture methods and a phage based plus culture method,
    tested blinded and in parallel on aliquoted samples of blood buffy coats processed at differing
    laboratories with expertise in using each method. All positive MAP cultures were identified and
    confirmed by validated specific molecular identification using either nested IS900PCR, ([36]) or
    IS900 plus MAP gene F57 PCRs [40]. Aliquots of the same samples were studied by each of the
    methods, but sufficient funding was not available to perform the same methods in all laboratories.
    The methods selected included a MGIT culture method previously used for MAP in human
    PBMCs advocated by Naser [37] and two new culture methods; TiKa decontamination and culture
    [39] and culture in 7H9+ broth (herein referred to as Pozzato culture) [42,43]. Culture of MAP from
    buffy coat white cell fractions using the MGIT method alone showed an increased correlation with
    CD patients compared to non-CD controls. The other two methods (TiKa and Pozzato culture),
    whilst also culturing MAP from a significant number of patients did not yield a significant
    difference between any of the groups. Previous meta-analyses (Feller and Abubakar, 2007) have
    indicated a higher rate of MAP detection, using molecular detection methodology in samples from
    CD patients compared to controls.

            Our culture results as a whole do not fully support this conclusion; however, these previous
    analyses were predominantly based on data from randomly targeted gastrointestinal mucosal
    biopsies, whilst our study tested blood samples, which could account for the discrepancy. In
    addition, and again in parallel on blinded aliquots of samples at a separate laboratory, we included
    an optimised phage amplification assay designed to detect viable MAP [44]. This rapid culture-
    based /phage amplification assay detects only viable mycobacterial cells present in samples that
    are able to take up and amplify mycobacterial specific phages, which then burst to release progeny
    phages. When released these can be plaque assayed and the plaques (containing the original lysed
    mycobacteria) subjected to species specific PCR to detect and quantify MAP presence within 48
    hours. In this study aliquots of the phage tested samples were in addition incubated in Pozzato
    medium and re-tested to confirm positivity after a period of growth. This method was able to
    detect viable mycobacteria in samples within 2 days and importantly was also able to show that of
    nine patients in our study that were initially MAP positive and could be followed up after one year,
    all remained positive for MAP in their blood after this time.

             The results show that both alternative culture approaches (TiKa and Pozzato cultures) were
    able to culture viable MAP more effectively than the reference MGIT method, irrespective of
    subject group. These findings suggest that the composition of MGIT ParaTB medium is not
    optimal for isolation of MAP from human PBMCs. Whilst the MGIT culture approach may have
    yielded a greater number of MAP positive cultures from PBMCs of CD patients compared to non-
    CD controls (the expected outcome in light of previous human PBMC testing of CD patients
    [36,37]), a similar or higher number of non-CD controls tested positive for viable MAP than CD
    patients by the TiKa and Pozzato culture methods. One explanation for this observation is that
    MAP phenotypes, persistent in blood are not in a fully growth competent physiological state or as
    occurs in other mycobacterial species have entered dormancy phases. This is possibly more

    particularly so in those patients receiving medication/chemotherapy which could have been
    involved in inducing these phenotypes. Hence some form of resuscitation of MAP may be
    necessary before growth can occur. The differing composition of TiKa and Pozzato broths could
    offer a reason for this discrepancy in MAP resuscitation capability. Both are based on Middlebrook
    7H9 but the TiKa system includes TiKa supplemented Pozzato culture medium followed by long
    term culture in TiKa supplemented MGIT culture whilst the Pozzato medium used in our study
    excluded the addition of egg yolk as previously described to isolate MAP from cattle faeces [42]
    to allow optical density of cultures to be monitored during incubation. Further work is necessary
    to determine the essential ingredient in this case.
            A further difference between sample testing in the each of the laboratories was the age of
    the PBMCs at the time of culture. Sample transport times differed which could have affected the
    conditions to which they were exposed. It is plausible the viability of MAP cells in the PBMC
    samples may have reduced the longer it took for transit. This is evidenced by significant differences
    in plaque numbers obtained with the phage assay for PBMC samples that were older at the time of
    testing. Perhaps it is beneficial to delay PBMC testing for a few days to allow either resuscitation
    of MAP cells in the transport medium (which was MGIT medium with OADC added) or lysis of
    PBMC cells making MAP cells more available for culture.
            Our results indicate a significant percentage of subjects had MAP bacteremia, irrespective
    of the underlying disease and positive in more than one of the culture methods. There are three
    possible explanations for this finding: 1) viable MAP is passively acquired from consumed food
    and not immediately cleared by the host following food consumption. This explanation is unlikely
    because other organisms that are consumed in the diet, survive the digestive process, and cross the
    “leaky bowel” in IBD into the blood do not cause persistent viable bacteremia in these hosts; 2)
    MAP is present, persistent and viable but does not cause disease in any human host. This
    explanation is also unlikely since there are no previously known examples of persistent bacteremia
    by a known pathogen without conferring some sort of effect 3) MAP persistently infects some
    hosts and as a pathogen is able to influence disease processes in some susceptible human hosts.
    We believe that the third explanation is most likely, and that MAP represents a zoonotic agent. In
    this case human infection resembles the known pathogenic state in cattle in which only a minority
    of animals (10%) develop advanced clinical JD with the majority exhibiting sub-clinical persistent
    infection [52]. A prior study indicated a proportion of apparently healthy individuals who may have
    asymptomatic mycobacterial infection. In immune recognition studies [23] 2.8% of 288 healthy
    blood donors were positive for antibody to mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 (anti-Hsp 65
    antibody), whilst 67.9% of 109 CD patients and 85.7% of Sjogren’s syndrome patients were
    positive for anti-Hsp 65 antibody suggesting that MAP infection and immune presentation and
    processing is common.

            The following caveats apply to this study. These statistics were based on a sample
    population that was not a random sample nor guaranteed to be representative for age, gender,
    disease severity or health. In addition, neither the Hsp65 antibody nor the MAP IDEXX antibody
    assay are specific for MAP and may cross react with other mycobacterial species. This study points
    to the urgent need for further in-depth MAP studies to fully explore the role of this organism in
    humans. An obvious area of further research is the discovery of better therapies applied in
    controlled clinical trials that target and attempt to eliminate MAP [53]. MAP culture and phage
    assay studies should be conducted in other diseases of unknown etiology by experts of these

    methods. Finally, as a minimum measure of best practice, the possibility that MAP is a zoonotic
    pathogen should prompt public health measures to better control JD and MAP spread into food
    and the environment by governments worldwide.

    strain US5 recovered from one subject (US5) who had a concurrent sample that was positive on
    the phage assay to nine assembled MAP genomes of bovine and one of human origin available at
    NCBI. Scale bar is representative of the frequency of variation per site across compared across the
    genomes of the other strains displayed on this phylogenetic tree.

    Supplementary Figure 2. Mean plaque numbers ± 95% CI (or SEM) obtained for phage
    assay positive PBMCs from CD patients and non-CD controls.




    T-test indicated no significant difference between mean plaque numbers of the two subject
    categories (CD patients 63.85 plaques and Non-CD controls 53.27 plaques, p-value =
    0.6385), but variance within the two subject categories is significantly different (p-value =
    0.0091).

    draw in USA and commencement of testing at Queen’s University Belfast, UK, on plaque
    numbers obtained with the phage assay.




    One-way ANOVA indicates significantly higher plaque numbers (p-value = 0.0012) for
    phage assay positive PBMC samples tested at 4 days post-draw compared to phage assay
    positive PBMC samples tested at 6 or 7 days post-draw.
