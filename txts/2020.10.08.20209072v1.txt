  39      Abstract
  40      Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting HIV care globally, with gaps in HIV
  41      treatment expected to increase HIV transmission and HIV-related mortality. We estimated
  42      how COVID-19-related disruptions could impact HIV transmission and mortality among men
  43      who have sex with men (MSM) in four cities in China.
  44
  45      Methods Regional data from China indicated that the number of MSM undergoing facility-
  46      based HIV testing reduced by 59% during the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside reductions in
  47      ART initiation (34%), numbers of sexual partners (62%) and consistency of condom use
  48      (25%). A deterministic mathematical model of HIV transmission and treatment among MSM
  49      in China was used to estimate the impact of these disruptions on the number of new HIV
  50      infections and HIV-related deaths. Disruption scenarios were assessed for their individual
  51      and combined impact over 1 and 5 years for a 3-, 4- or 6-month disruption period.
  52
  53      Results Our China model predicted that new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths would
  54      be increased most by disruptions to viral suppression, with 25% reductions for a 3-month
  55      period increasing HIV infections by 5-14% over 1 year and deaths by 7-12%. Observed
  56      reductions in condom use increased HIV infections by 5-14% but had minimal impact (<1%)
  57      on deaths. Smaller impacts on infections and deaths (<3%) were seen for disruptions to
  58      facility testing and ART initiation, but reduced partner numbers resulted in 11-23% fewer
  59      infections and 0.4-1.0% fewer deaths. Longer disruption periods of 4 and 6 months amplified
  60      the impact of combined disruption scenarios. When all realistic disruptions were modelled
  61      simultaneously, an overall decrease in new HIV infections was always predicted over one
  62      year (3-17%), but not over 5 years (1% increase-4% decrease), while deaths mostly increased
  63      over one year (1-2%) and 5 years (1.2 increase – 0.3 decrease).
  64
  65      Conclusions The overall impact of COVID-19 on new HIV infections and HIV-related
  66      deaths is dependent on the nature, scale and length of the various disruptions. Resources
  67      should be directed to ensuring levels of viral suppression and condom use are maintained to
  68      mitigate any adverse effects of COVID-19 related disruption on HIV transmission and
  69      control among MSM in China.

  72      Introduction
  73      Globally, 37.9 million people are living with HIV (PLWH) [1], with men who have sex with
  74      men (MSM) disproportionally affected [2]. In China, a recent systematic review indicated an
  75      HIV prevalence of 5.7% (95% CI:5.4-6.1%) among MSM, with increasing HIV prevalence in
  76      this group over time (2001-2018) [3]. Efforts to manage the HIV epidemic in China have
  77      been made increasingly difficult by the emergent COVID-19 pandemic [4,5], having
  78      significant potential to affect the HIV care continuum and patterns of sexual risk behaviour in
  79      numerous settings worldwide [6–10]. Close examination of this syndemic is a key issue for
  80      global public health [11].
  81
  82      Among PLWH in China - who already face high levels of HIV stigma, psychological
  83      distress, and suboptimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) [4] - the COVID-19
  84      pandemic has presented further barriers to HIV control [5]. Quarantine and social distancing
  85      reduce access to routine HIV testing which reduces the identification and treatment of new
  86      HIV infections [12]. Timely linkage to HIV services and initiation of ART have been
  87      affected during the COVID-19 pandemic, with many hospitals designated for treatment of
  88      COVID-19 suspending taking on new patients with HIV [4]. The COVID-19 pandemic has
  89      hindered ART, due to hospital visits being restricted from city lockdowns/traffic controls [4].
  90      In February 2020, a survey in China found 32.6% of PLWH were at risk of ART
  91      discontinuation and about half (48.6%) did not know where to get ART in the near future
  92      [13]. These gaps in HIV treatment could lead to increased HIV-related deaths and higher risk
  93      of HIV transmission. Conversely, MSM in other countries have reported having fewer sexual
  94      partners during periods of COVID-19-related lockdown, which may temporarily reduce HIV
  95      transmission [7].
  96
  97      Mathematical modelling can be used to capture the complexity of these changes and estimate
  98      the impacts of COVID-19 on HIV epidemiology. One modelling study of PLWH in Africa
  99      projected that a 6-month interruption in ART supply across 50% of the population on
 100      treatment could lead to a 60% increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period [14].
 101      Another modelling study on low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC) projected that HIV-
 102      related deaths would increase by 10% over the next five years, with the greatest impact on
 103      mortality estimated to be from ART interruptions [15]. However, neither of these studies

 104      used observed COVID-19 impact data to inform their modelled disruptions, which is
 105      essential for obtaining reliable projections for the true scale of COVID-19 disruptions.
 106
 107      To our knowledge no COVID-19 impact modelling has been published focussing on key
 108      populations, who are the main groups affected by HIV [16]. In addition, no model projections
 109      have to date incorporated observed data from the COVID-19 disruption. In this study, we
 110      addressed this by collating data on the impact of COVID-19 and resulting lockdown
 111      measures on HIV testing and treatment among PLWH, sexual risk behaviour and condom use
 112      among MSM in China. We used a deterministic model of HIV transmission and treatment
 113      among MSM in China to estimate the impact of these disruptions on new HIV infections and
 114      HIV-related deaths. We identified where HIV prevention and treatment efforts should be
 115      focussed to help mitigate potential adverse effects of COVID-19.
 116
 117      Methods
 118      Observed disruptions due to COVID-19 in China
 119      Estimates of changes in HIV testing (among MSM), treatment initiation and viral load
 120      suppression (among all PLWH) came from surveillance data from Jiangsu province (HIV
 121      testing/clinics), from the first quarter of 2019 and 2020 [17]. Estimates of changes in number
 122      of sexual partners and consistency of condom use came from an online survey conducted
 123      among MSM (N=731) across 31 provinces in China between 18/05/2020-02/06/2020, during
 124      the COVID-19 pandemic. From these data, we estimated the following percentage changes
 125      due to the disruption caused by COVID-19, compared to the pre-COVID period (before
 126      01/01/2020):
 127
 128         I.     The number of MSM undergoing facility-based HIV testing in the first quarter of
 129                2019 was 6436 compared to 2641 in 2020, a reduction of 59% (95% CI:58-60%).
 130        II.     The number of PLWH initiating ART in the first quarter of 2019 was 315 compared
 131                to 208 in 2020, a reduction of 34% (95% CI:29-39%).
 132       III.     There was no change in viral suppression (VS) among PLWH. 95.3% (940/986; 95%
 133                CI:93.8-96.6%) of viral load tests showed VS in the first quarter of 2019, with similar
 134                numbers in 2020 (96.0%, 928/967; 95% CI:94.5-97.1%). The proportion of diagnosed
 135                PLWH who had a viral load test was similar in both years: 4.7% in the first quarter of

 136                2019 and 4.3% in the first quarter of 2020. Note most viral load tests in this region are
 137                conducted in the 3rd/4th quarter.
 138       IV.      62% (313/506) of MSM reported reduced numbers of sexual partners compared to the
 139                pre-pandemic period (among those who had male partners in the last six months).
 140        V.      25% (126/506) of MSM used fewer condoms with their partners compared to the pre-
 141                pandemic period.
 142
 143      Mathematical model
 144      We used a model of HIV testing/transmission/treatment among MSM in China which was
 145      previously developed to evaluate the long-term impact of an HIV self-testing intervention in
 146      four cities (Guangzhou/Shenzhen/Jinan/Qingdao) [18]. All individuals within the model are
 147      categorised by infection status, risk (≤/>two male anal sex partners in the last three months),
 148      anal       sex       role      (always        insertive/versatile/always         receptive),      infection     stage
 149      (acute/CD4>500/351-500/200-350/<200 cells/µl), and diagnosed/ART status. Uninfected
 150      MSM enter the population upon sexual debut and leave through migration or non-HIV/HIV-
 151      related death. Those not on ART move into more advanced stages of infection, while those
 152      on ART do not; their mortality is modelled as a function of infection stage at ART initiation
 153      (Fig.S2).
 154
 155      Both facility-based and self-testing are modelled, and MSM are distinguished by whether or
 156      not they have previously tested. Those on ART who drop out re-enter the diagnosed
 157      compartments. HIV transmission occurs via anal sex between MSM at a rate which depends
 158      on HIV disease stage/ART coverage/VS/total partners/total sex acts/sexual role/condom
 159      efficacy and use. The model was calibrated to MSM city-level HIV epidemics, parameterised
 160      using        demographic/behaviour                 data     from      CDC/trials,          calibrated    to     local
 161      city/province/national-level              estimates      (“fitting   metrics”)       of     HIV     prevalence/ART
 162      coverage/diagnosis/incidence/population size [18]. The model was solved in R.3.5.1.
 163      Model/schematics (Figs.S2-3), parameters/fitting metrics (Table S6) and fitting metrics
 164      (Fig.S1) are given in the supplement.
 165
 166      Base case scenario (no COVID-19)
 167      The model was run for five years until 01/01/2025 using the fitted model parameters, with all
 168      parameters constant at their 2019 values from 01/01/2020 onwards. These base case runs
 169      predicted the non-COVID-19 trajectory of HIV prevalence and care for each city.

 170
 171      COVID-19-related disruption scenarios
 172      Disruption scenarios were implemented from 01/01/2020 and run for 3 months, after which
 173      all parameters were reset to their original pre-COVID-19 values. Comparisons of these
 174      scenarios with the base case were made over one (01/01/2021) and five years (01/01/2025).
 175
 176      The following observed disruption scenarios were based on the observed disruptions –
 177      reductions in:
 178           A. facility-based HIV testing (59%)
 179           B. ART initiation (34%)
 180           C. number of sexual partnerships (31–62%)
 181           D. condom use (12.5–25%)
 182
 183      Although data from Jiangsu province suggested no disruption to VS, disruptions in ART
 184      provision have been reported to the WHO [19]. We explored an additional hypothetical
 185      scenario where VS was reduced by 10% (consistent with reductions in ART access among
 186      MSM in United States [7]) and 25% (consistent with disruptions to ART uptake reported
 187      among PLWH in China [4]):
 188           E. Reduction in VS of 10/25%
 189
 190      The data on sexual partnerships and condom use estimated the proportion of MSM having
 191      fewer partnerships/using condoms less frequently (not of their overall reductions). We
 192      sampled partnership and condom use parameters from uniform distributions with bounds of
 193      half-reported to full-reported reductions. Reductions in condom use were modelled as a
 194      reduction in the proportion of sex acts in which a condom is used. Reductions in HIV testing
 195      and ART initiations were modelled as reductions in the facility-based HIV testing rate and
 196      ART initiation rate, and reductions in partner numbers were modelled as reductions in
 197      numbers of partners per year (applied across all risk groups). VS reductions were modelled as
 198      increases in infectiousness and HIV-related mortality among those on ART, assuming a
 199      proportion (10%/25%) of virally suppressed MSM stop taking ART, having the same
 200      infectiousness and HIV-related mortality as individuals not on ART. No reduction in HIV
 201      self-testing rates were modelled, in line with local observations in Jiangsu.

 203      We assessed the impact of each disruption (A,B,C,D,E) separately, and also assessed the
 204      combined impact of these disruptions occurring simultaneously (±scenario-E). The impacts
 205      of disruptions lasting 3, 4 and 6 months were assessed.
 206
 207      The outcome measures used to assess the disruption caused by COVID-19 were total and
 208      relative percentage change in new infections and HIV-related deaths, compared to the base
 209      case, non-COVID-19 scenario. These impacts were evaluated over 1-year (01/01/2020-
 210      01/01/2021) and 5-years (01/01/2020-01/01/2025). All impact measures were expressed as
 211      median values and 95% credible intervals (95% CrI), across the 100 selected parameter sets
 212      in each city, and across the 400 parameter sets from all cities.
 213
 214      We analysed the sensitivity of these scenarios (A,B,C,D,E) to different magnitudes of
 215      disruption (0,25,50,75,100%) over 1 and 5 years with a 3-month disruption. We plot the %
 216      change in new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths as a function of each individual
 217      disruption parameter.
 218
 219      Results
 220      The percentage change in impact measures (new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths) did
 221      not vary between each city, with greater within-city variation across the scenarios. Therefore,
 222      all results are presented as the overall impact across four cities (Table S1,
 223      Guangzhou/Shenzhen/Jinan/Qingdao), with results for each city in the supplement (Tables
 224      S2-5).
 225
 226      Single and combined 3-month disruptions
 227      Realistic disruptions to facility-based HIV testing, ART initiation and condom use were each
 228      estimated to lead to an increase in new HIV infections among MSM (Fig.1a, Tables S1-S5).
 229      Disruptions to condom use (scenario-D) lasting 3 months were predicted to lead to the largest
 230      overall relative increase in HIV infections, of 7.8% (95% CrI:4.5-13.8%) over one year
 231      (Fig.1a), with relative increases of 2.3% (1.7-2.9%) and 1.7% (1.2-2.4%) predicted over 1
 232      year for realistic 3-month disruptions to facility-based HIV testing (scenario-A) and ART
 233      initiations (scenario-B), respectively. Reductions in numbers of sexual partners (scenario-C)
 234      were predicted to reduce HIV infections, by a median 16.2% (11.1-23.2%) over one year
 235      among MSM following a 3-month disruption.

 236
 237      A hypothetical 10%/25% reduction in VS (E10/E25) would lead to increased numbers of
 238      HIV infections. 25% reductions in VS increased new HIV infections by 7.4% (4.7-14.0%)
 239      over one year given a 3-month disruption.
 240
 241      The effect of each disruption scenario on the relative percentage change in HIV infections
 242      was always smaller over five years than after one year (but not the absolute difference in HIV
 243      infections, which generally increased over 5 years), with a more rapid decrease in effect over
 244      5 years seen for disruptions to partnership numbers, condom use and VS (Fig.1a).
 245
 246      When all of the observed disruptions (A+B+C+D) were modelled simultaneously, a decrease
 247      in new HIV infections was always predicted over one year (median 8.7%, (2.8%-17.2%)), but
 248      over 5 years this impact reduced to a 1.6% (-0.6%-4.3%) decrease in new HIV infections due
 249      to the disruptions to HIV testing (increase 1.7%, 1.2%-2.4%) and ART initiation (increase
 250      1.1%, 0.7-1.8%) having a longer-lasting effect on ART outcomes, with ART taking longer
 251      post-disruption to return to pre-disruption levels.
 252
 253      HIV-related deaths were also predicted to increase following disruptions to HIV testing/ART
 254      initiations/condom use/VS (scenarios-A,B,D,E), and decrease following disruptions to
 255      partnerships (scenario-C) (Fig.1b, Tables S1-S5). Small impacts (<1%) on HIV-related
 256      deaths were predicted over one year for 3-month disruptions to HIV testing, partner numbers
 257      or condom use. Larger increases in HIV-related deaths were predicted to occur following 3-
 258      month disruptions to ART initiations – a 1.8% (1.5-2.0%) increase over one year–and,
 259      especially, VS – a 10.1% (7.6-12.7%) increase over one year following a 25% VS reduction.
 260      The observed disruptions together (A+B+C+D) resulted in 1.5% (1.1-1.8%) more HIV-
 261      related deaths over one year and 0.6% (-0.3-1.2%) over five years.
 262
 263      Including reductions of 10%/25% in levels of VS alongside the other, observed scenarios
 264      (A+B+C+D+E10, A+B+C+D+E25) always led to an increase in new HIV infections, and,
 265      particularly, an increase in HIV-related deaths, over a 1- or 5-year time horizon, compared to
 266      the observed scenarios (A+B+C+D) alone (Figs.1a,b).

 269      When comparing the impacts of two combined disruption scenarios (A+B+C+D and
 270      A+B+C+D+E25) for disruptions lasting 3/4/6 months, we found impacts on both new HIV
 271      infections and HIV-related deaths were approximately linear, with a 4-month disruption
 272      leading to around 34% greater impact than a 3-month disruption, and a 6-month disruption
 273      around two times the impact of a 3-month disruption, over both the 1- and 5-year time
 274      horizons (Fig.2).
 275
 276      Impact in different cities
 277      The absolute numbers of predicted additional/prevented infections and deaths varied for each
 278      city (Tables S2-S5), related to differing MSM population sizes, but the percentage changes in
 279      infections and deaths did not vary substantially between cities (Fig.3, Tables S2-S5). For
 280      example, for scenario A+B+C+D, the overall predicted reduction in new HIV infections over
 281      one year varied from 8.7% (-2.8-17.2%) in Qingdao to 9.1% (2.5-15.0%) in Jinan, with far
 282      greater within-city than between-city uncertainty (Fig.3).
 283
 284      Over 5 years, realistic 3-month disruptions to HIV testing, ART initiations, sexual risk
 285      behaviour and condom use (scenario A+B+C+D) would lead to on average 3 fewer new HIV
 286      infections but 1 additional HIV-related death among MSM in Jinan and Qingdao, 6 fewer
 287      infections and 3 additional deaths in Guangzhou, and to 18 fewer HIV infections but 9
 288      additional HIV-related deaths among MSM in Shenzhen.
 289
 290      The combined hypothetical scenario (A+B+C+D+E) lasting for 3 months, over 5 years,
 291      would lead to an average 3 additional new HIV infections in Guangzhou, 7 in Shenzhen but
 292      no change in Jinan and Qingdao, with 11 additional HIV-related deaths in Guangzhou, 33 in
 293      Shenzhen and 3 in Jinan and Qingdao.
 294
 295      Sensitivity in disruption magnitude
 296      Over 1 or 5 years, with a 3-month disruption, the relationship between the magnitude of the
 297      disruption (0,25,50,75,100%) and the projected impact was always linear (Fig.S4-5, Table
 298      S7-8), with higher values of % disruption leading to increases in new HIV infections and
 299      HIV-related deaths for four disruption parameters (facility testing/ART initiation/condom
 300      use/VS) but not for partnership disruption, (fewer infections and deaths).

 302      For a 3-month disruption evaluated over a 1-year, theoretical disruption scenarios A-E50
 303      (affecting 50% of MSM) increased new HIV-infections by 1.8%, 2.4%, -16.7% (decrease),
 304      15.8% and 11.3% respectively, and increased HIV-related deaths by 0.1%, 2.5%, -0.4%
 305      (decrease), 0.5% and 18.2% respectively (Fig.S4, Table S7). If disruption scenarios affected
 306      100% of MSM (A-E100), then new HIV-infections were projected to increase to 3.7%, 4.9%,
 307      -30.2% (decrease for 95% affecting MSM – the model requires >0 partnerships), 38.7% and
 308      29.3% respectively. Scenarios A-E100 would also cause HIV related deaths to increase to
 309      0.3%, 5.3%, -0.8% (decrease – for 95% disruption), 1% and 35.7% respectively.
 310
 311      Discussion
 312      Available data in this analysis suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic and measures
 313      undertaken against it have resulted in reduced rates of HIV testing and treatment among
 314      MSM in this region of China but have not so far had an impact on VS rates. Survey data also
 315      suggested MSM in China had fewer partners and used condoms less often during the
 316      COVID-19 pandemic. Using these data in our modelling analysis, simulating realistic 3-
 317      month disruptions to HIV testing, ART initiation, condom use and partner numbers, we
 318      found fewer new HIV infections are projected to occur among MSM in China over 2020 (9%
 319      fewer) than would have occurred in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a smaller
 320      decrease (2%) seen over 5 years. This decrease was largely due to reductions in sexual
 321      partner numbers counteracting a reduction in ART initiations and condom use. Our models
 322      do suggest these disruptions will lead to small increases in HIV-related deaths (2% over 1
 323      year and 1% over 5 years). When we also evaluated potential reductions in VS of 25%
 324      alongside these observed disruptions, we predicted a 4% decrease in new HIV infections and
 325      10% increase in HIV-related deaths over one year. When evaluating the effects of each
 326      individual disruption separately, new HIV infections were most adversely affected by
 327      disruptions in condom use and VS, and HIV-related deaths by reductions in VS. Therefore,
 328      our results suggest HIV prevention and treatment efforts should focus on maintaining use of
 329      condoms and VS among MSM in China to mitigate short- and long-term adverse effects of
 330      the COVID-19 disruption.
 331
 332      Although disruptions to VS had consequences for HIV incidence/mortality, data from Jiangsu
 333      [17] indicated no change in VS among PLWH due to COVID-19 disruption. Other surveys
 334      among PLWH in China indicate disruptions to ART access [4] which could lead to

 335      reductions in VS. It is critically important to quantify such reductions in treatment access and
 336      VS among MSM in China, and we suggest that future surveys should focus their efforts on
 337      determining the true scale of the disruption to VS, which is likely to be delayed and could
 338      occur after observed treatment disruptions.
 339
 340      The length of disruption is also critical in determining the longer-term impacts of COVID-19.
 341      Throughout our main analysis we used a disruption length of 3 months, with sensitivity
 342      analyses (with longer 4/6-month disruptions) demonstrating a linear relationship between the
 343      duration of disruption and the change in both new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths,
 344      with a doubling in disruption duration leading to a doubling in the impact. When assessing
 345      the combined impact of the observed disruptions, the direction of the linear relationship was
 346      different for HIV-related deaths (positive – longer duration gave more deaths) and new HIV
 347      infections (negative – longer duration gave fewer new infections).
 348
 349      The absolute numbers of new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths varied between the four
 350      cities in China modelled, due to the different population sizes, epidemiology and care cascade
 351      in each city (reflected in data used for calibration [18]). However, the percentage change in
 352      impact measures did not vary between each city, with much greater within-city variation.
 353      This result is surprising, considering each city has different future projected HIV prevalence
 354      (5.0 – 12.2% in 2036, based on data specific to these cities [20] in Booton et al. [18]) and are
 355      in two different provinces (Guangdong/Shandong). Therefore, the impact predicted in this
 356      study is likely to be applicable to MSM within any city/region in China.
 357
 358      We may compare our results to other modelling studies predicting the potential impact of
 359      COVID-19 related disruption on HIV prevention and treatment. Jewell et al. [14] used
 360      multiple African models of 3 month disruptions affecting 50% from 01/04/2020, reporting
 361      increases in HIV incidence of <1% from the suspension of HIV testing (compared to our
 362      prediction of 1-2% for 50% reductions in facility testing, scenario-A50, all scenarios in Table
 363      S7), <2% from no new ART initiations (2-4%, scenario-B50), 2-9% from the interruption of
 364      condom availability (12-33%, scenario-D50), 4-89% from ART interruption (9-31% for 50%
 365      reduction in VS, scenario-E50). Suspension of testing for 50% increased deaths by <1%
 366      (<1%, scenario-A50), ART initiation <2% (2-3%, scenario-B50) and condom availability 0%

 367      (0-1%, scenario-D50) with ART interruption causing an increase of 17-62% (14-25%,
 368      scenario-E50). Our results align well with these estimates, considering the different
 369      methodology/definitions of disruption/population (all adults/children, compared to solely
 370      MSM) and underlying models and data (different settings/treatment/condom use). This is a
 371      major strength of our study, the use of early data from China, to estimate data-driven (rather
 372      than theoretical) magnitudes of COVID-19-related disruptions. Another major strength of this
 373      study was performing our analysis on four separate cities from two distinct regions within
 374      China. In addition, our analysis involves various scenarios and the effects of combining these
 375      enables us to better understand the relative impact of different disruptions.
 376
 377      Generalising our results to LMIC should be done with consideration of the differences
 378      between China and the respective country. Early estimates of COVID-19 impacts on
 379      testing/treatment/sexual risk behaviour were available as China was the first centre of the
 380      COVID-19 pandemic, and as more data becomes available, other LMIC countries may report
 381      different survey data. Our modelling analysis was able to highlight which of these disruptions
 382      are likely to have the biggest negative impacts on HIV incidence and deaths, indicating
 383      disruptions which should be prioritised for monitoring and mitigation in other countries.
 384
 385      Our analysis has some limitations which should be acknowledged. Not all of the disruption
 386      estimates were MSM specific, and MSM may have had more substantial disruption when
 387      compared to other populations (MSM facility testing was reduced by 59%, compared to 29%
 388      for the entire population [17]). Therefore, we may have underestimated the disruption to ART
 389      initiations. The survey data only gave semi-quantitative estimates of disruptions to
 390      partnerships and condom use i.e. proportion of MSM having fewer partners and not the
 391      overall reduction in partner numbers. We accounted for this by exploring uncertainty in the
 392      reduction and sampling from a wider distribution of estimates. Further, the disruption
 393      estimates for testing/ART initiations/VS came from Jiangsu, different to the cities we model
 394      (Guangdong/Shandong), and estimates for disruptions to partner numbers/condom use came
 395      from 31 provinces, meaning we may not have fully captured the impact of COVID-19 in each
 396      city. Finally, we have not modelled the direct impacts of COVID-19 infection. Future
 397      extensions work could include modelling the potential characteristics of co-infection between
 398      HIV and COVID-19.

 400      Conclusions
 401      The COVID-19 emergency is impacting HIV care worldwide, as face-to-face consultations
 402      and laboratory testing are reduced, drug and condom manufacture and transport are
 403      interrupted, and lockdowns affect peoples’ ability to access testing or collect medicines. Gaps
 404      in HIV treatment could lead to increased deaths from HIV and further HIV transmission,
 405      placing further burdens upon healthcare systems. The overall impact of COVID-19 on new
 406      HIV infections and HIV-related deaths is expected to be low to moderate for MSM in China,
 407      but this is dependent on the scale and length of the various disruptions. Resources should be
 408      urgently directed to ensuring VS and condom use remain high in order to mitigate any
 409      adverse effects of COVID-19 disruption on HIV transmission and control among MSM in
 410      China.
