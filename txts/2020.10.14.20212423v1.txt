    2. Abstract (324 words)
    Importance
    Devising control strategies against diseases such as COVID-19 require understanding of
    contextual social mixing and contact patterns. There has been no standardized multi-site social
    contact study conducted in workplace settings in the United States that can be used to broadly
    inform pandemic preparedness policy in these settings.
    Objective
    The study aimed to characterize the patterns of social contacts and mixing across workplace
    environments, including on-site or when teleworking.
    Design
    This was a cross-sectional non-probability survey that used standardized social contact diaries
    to collect data. Employees were requested to record their physical and non-physical contacts in
    a diary over two consecutive days, documented at the end of each day. Employees from each
    company were enrolled through email and electronic diaries sent as individual links. Data were
    collected from April to June 2020.
    Setting
    Two multinational consulting companies and one university administrative department, all
    located in Georgia, USA.
    Participants
    Employees opted into the study by accepting the invitation on a link sent via email.
    Main Outcome
    The outcome was median number of contacts per person per day. This was stratified by day of
    data collection, age, sex, race and ethnicity.
    Results
    Of 3,835 employees approached, 357 (9.3%) completed the first day of contact diary of which
    304 completed both days of contact diary. There was a median of 2 contacts (IQR: 1-4, range: 0-
    21) per respondent on both day one and two. The majority (55%) of contacts involved
    conversation only, occurred at home (64%), and cumulatively lasted more than 4 hours (38%).
    Most contacts were repeated, and within same age groups, though participants aged 30-59
    years reported substantial inter-generational mixing with children.
    Conclusion
    Participating employees in 3 surveyed workplaces reported few contacts, similar to studies
    from the UK and China when shelter-in-place orders were in effect during the pandemic. Many
    contacts were repeated which may limit the spread of infection. Future rounds are planned to
    assess changes in contact patterns when employees resume work in the office after the
    lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic.

    3. Introduction (1,194 words)
    The workplace is a key setting for social interactions and respiratory infection transmission,
    where 16% (range 9-33%) of influenza transmission is estimated to occur 1. Accordingly, the
    workplace is an important target to reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
    (SARS-CoV-2) transmission through policies including remote work. In mid-April 2020, 62% of
    employed adults reported working remotely 2 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The
    potential impact of remote work on COVID-19 transmission can be quantified by assessing
    changes in social contact patterns 3,4. Mathematical models used to forecast epidemics and
    simulate the effects of interventions are highly sensitive to assumptions about who acquires
    infection from whom. These assumptions are based on data of social contact patterns, or the
    frequency and nature of contacts that individuals make on a daily basis.
    There is a dearth of social contact data for the United States, especially in workplaces. One
    published telephone study from one US 5 state reported variation by age, day of the week and
    holiday period. Along with households, adults spend most of their time at work 6 where 20-25%
    of their contacts are with individuals from diverse ages and home locations 1. Our study aimed
    to characterize contact patterns relevant to respiratory infection spread during the COVID-19
    pandemic among employees of two multinational consulting companies (N1=275, N2=3000) and
    one administrative department of a university (N3=560) in Atlanta, Georgia, from April to June
    2020.




                                                                      3

    4. Methods
    Company officials sent emails inviting all staff working in their US offices to participate.
    Participants opted into the study by consenting online. Each participant completed an
    enrolment survey which collected information on socio-demographics, the workplace, and
    household structure. Participants were expected to complete two consecutive days of online
    diaries through a personalized emailed survey link. Multiple daily contacts with the same
    person were recorded once, as well as the total time spent with that person. Contact with the
    same person on both days was counted as two contacts. A contact was defined as either non-
    physical (a two-way conversation with three or more words exchanged in the physical presence
    of another person) or physical (directly touching someone, either skin-to-skin or over the
    clothes).7 Remote work was defined as working from a location outside their designated site of
    work, including home or a public space. Each contact was characterized by age, sex, duration
    and location. For the second day of contact diary, we asked if each contact was repeated from
    the first day to assess contact persistence.
    We summarized the median number of contacts per person per day stratified by age group,
    sex, race and household structure of the participant. We constructed age-specific contact
    matrices using four age groups for the participants (20-29, 30-39, 40-59, 60+ years) and six age
    groups for the contacts (0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-59, 60+ years) and present age-specific
    average number of contacts per person per day. We assessed mixing within same age groups
    (assortative mixing) using the Q index (appendix 1) 8. All analysis was done in R v3.6.2. Ethical
    approval was given by Yale University (IRB# 2000026906).




                                                                      4

    5. Results
    The overall response rate for the first day of the contact diary was 9.3% (357/3,835), of which
    304 (85%) participants completed both days of contact diary. Because we found no substantial
    differences in characteristics between participants who completed one day only and both days,
    main results are summarized for the individuals who completed both.
    The median age of the participants was 36 years (range 21-78) with around 50% aged 20-39
    years and 10% older than 60 years (Table 1.) The majority self-identified as white (58%) and
    women (61%). Most participants reported at least a bachelor’s degree (94%), and all worked in
    office-based roles such as analysts, consultants, and managers. Household structures ranged
    from living with spouse only (32%), spouse and children only (25%), parent (8%), roommate or
    sibling (13%) or alone (15%); the most common state of residence was Georgia (49%). Almost
    all participants worked remotely on the day of diary completion (95%).
    A median of 2 contacts (IQR: 1-4, range: 0-21) was reported per respondent on both days. Over
    both days, a median of 2 contacts (IQR: 1-4) was reported. The number of contacts differed by
    household structure but not by sex, age group, race or ethnicity. Individuals living alone or
    living with their spouse only reported a median of 0 contacts (IQR: 0-2) which was lower than
    individuals living with spouse and children, sibling or roommate or with at least a parent
    (median 3; Table 1).
    Of the 608 diary-days, 202 (33%) were collected in April and 406 (67%) were collected in May
    and June. Among the 1,548 social contacts reported across two days of data collection, 55%
    were conversation only, 12% were physical contact only, and 34% were conversation and
    physical contact (Figure 1). Among these, 64% occurred at home, 14% on the streets or at
    stores, 6% at work, and 5% at another person’s home ( Panel A). We report both long lasting
    (38% of contacts lasting >4 hours) and short (32% lasting <15 minutes) contacts. 97% of long-
    lasting contacts occurred at the participant’s home while 78% of short contacts occurred
    outside. Sixty two percent of contacts were repeated over both days of data collection. 87% of
    repeat contacts occurred in the participant’s home.
    The age-stratified contact matrix ( Panel B) details average contacts made by participants and
    contacts within and across age groups. The peak mean numbers of contacts were on the main
    diagonal, indicating preferential mixing among individuals of the same age group. However,
    there was little evidence of assortative mixing by age for contacts above 20 years (Q
    index=0.27). The mixing matrix also shows inter-generational mixing involving 30-59-year-old
    participants and children.

    6. Discussion
    Participating study employees reported a median of 2 contacts from April to June 2020, when
    shelter-in-place orders were in effect in Georgia and most other states 7 . Of the contacts that
    were reported, the majority were at home and were repeated rather than new. As such,
    employees who responded to the survey were not making many new contacts during this phase
    of the pandemic, which could limit transmission risk.
    Recruitment in companies was online and elicited few responses despite regular reminders and
    monetary incentives. Employees interested in public health or who adhere to social distancing
    policies may be more likely to respond. Public health messaging calling for social distancing may
    have created stigma around reporting high contact rates resulting in the low contact rates
    reported in this study. These selection and information biases may have led to underreporting
    of contact rates. We lack pre-pandemic data from this specific population for direct
    comparison, but other studies in the UK 10 and China 4 report reduced contact rates by office
    workers during the pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many U.S. companies instituted
    work-from-home policies 11, likely drastically reducing total number of contacts in workplaces
    and the general population. In subsequent rounds of the study, we will assess changes in
    contact patterns as employees return to work in office settings. In future, we aim to use the
    contact patterns to parameterize mathematical models describing risk of disease transmission
    and investigate prevention and control strategies to prevent transmission in the workplace.

    Figure 1. Panel (A) shows the distribution of contacts by attributes: duration (in minutes (mins)
    or hours (hr)). Types of contact were conversation with physical touch (Conv & Phys), physical
    only (Phys), or non-physical/conversation only (Conv only). A contact was repeated if observed
    on both days or unique if observed on only one day. Panel (B) shows the age-stratified average
    number of contacts over two study days. The gray area on the x-axis indicates that all
    respondents were over the age of 19, however they were able to report contacts under the age
    of 19 years. Data shown in the graphs are for 1,548 contacts recorded by 304 participants over
    608 diary-days

    8. Supplementary Information

    Appendix 1. Calculation of Q-index for assortativeness

    𝑄 = (𝑇𝑟(𝑃) − 1)/(𝑛 − 1) (eq.1)

    Where Tr(P) denotes the Trace of the matrix and P [𝑝𝑖𝑗 ] is the matrix whose elements 𝑝𝑖𝑗
    represent the proportion of total contacts of age group i with age group j. The elements are
    computed by the equation:

    𝑝𝑖𝑗 = 𝐾𝑖𝑗 / ∑𝑛𝑗 𝐾𝑖𝑗 (eq.2)

    Where 𝐾𝑖𝑗 is the total contacts of age group i with age group j, ∑𝑛𝑗 𝐾𝑖𝑗 is the total contacts made
    by age group i and n is the total number of participant age groups.

    The Q index ranges between negative one, corresponding to fully disassortative mixing, and
    one, under full diagonal dominance, i.e. fully assortative mixing. A Q index of zero corresponds
    to proportionate mixing. Therefore, Q represents a measure of departure from proportionate
    mixing for groups defined on a qualitative scale8.

    Appendix 2. Distributions of percentage of contacts by location (A), duration (B), type (C) and
    persistence (D) based on participants’ age group. In panel C, contacts are classified as
    conversation only (Conv only), conversation with physical touch (Conv & Phys) and physical
    touch only (Phys only).

    Appendix 3. Additional age-stratified mixing matrices by various contact attributes. Contact
    matrices at home, street or store, work, repeated over two days and unique over two days
    represent both conversation and physical contacts. In all panels, the grey area indicates that no
    data was collected from individuals aged 0-19 years.
