    Abstract
    Background: The reasons for the association between anxiety disorders and asthma
    are not fully established, and data from Africa is sparse. We investigated whether the
    association between anxiety disorders and asthma among adolescents may be partly
    related to shared exposures in early life.
    Methods: We conducted a case-control study among adolescents (12-17 years) with
    and without asthma in Wakiso District, an urban area in Uganda. Anxiety disorders
    were diagnosed by the Youth Inventory-4R (YI-4R), a Diagnostic and Statistical
    Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) referenced instrument. For this
    report, we focus on generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder and social
    anxiety disorder. Asthma was doctor-diagnosed by study clinicians. We used
    questionnaires to collect data on early life exposures. The data were analysed using
    multiple logistic regression models.
    Results: We enrolled 162 adolescents. Adolescents with asthma were more likely to
    have any of three anxiety disorders (44.6%) than adolescents without asthma (21.4%)
    [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-5.53, p-
    value=0.007]. The association was strong for GAD (AOR 4.49, 95% CI 1.48-13.56) and
    panic disorder (AOR 5.43, 95% CI 2.11-14.02), but not for social anxiety disorder
    (1.46, 95% CI 0.63-3.37). The early life risk factors associated with anxiety disorders
    among adolescents were similar to asthma risk factors previously published,
    including urban residence at birth [AOR 3.42 (1.29-9.09)] and during most of the first
    five years of life [AOR 2.87 (1.07-7.66)], father’s tertiary education [AOR 2.09 (1.00-
    4.37)], and adolescent’s history of other allergy-related diseases [AOR 4.64 (1.66-
    13.00)].
    Conclusion: We confirm a positive association between anxiety disorders and
    asthma among adolescents in urban Uganda. The early life risk factors associated
    with anxiety disorders among adolescents were similar to those for asthma in the
    same age-group, suggesting shared underlying causes.

    Introduction
    Anxiety disorders are among the first psychiatric disorders to emerge in childhood
    and adolescence1, 2, and are the sixth leading cause of illness and disability among
    adolescents aged 10–14 years and the ninth for adolescents aged 15–19 years
    globally1. Anxiety disorders are common, with global estimates for lifetime
    prevalence of 9.9-16.7% (inter-quartile range)3. Anxiety disorders, as classified by the
    Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5), include
    generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder,
    specific phobia, and panic disorder2. The causes of anxiety disorders are not fully
    known but environmental, developmental, and biological risk factors in early life
    have been identified2. Adolescents are at greater risk of anxiety disorders if they
    have chronic illnesses, such as asthma1.
    Asthma is the most common non-communicable disease among children, and is
    estimated to affect 235 million people globally, yet we still do not fully understand
    the causes4. Several early-life risk factors for asthma have been suggested including
    parental asthma, prenatal environmental tobacco smoke exposure and prematurity5.
    It has been observed that in Africa and other low- and middle-income countries
    (LMICs), the prevalence of asthma is higher in urban than rural areas6-9. Our study in
    Uganda found that the risk of asthma depended on area of residence at birth and in
    the first five years: lowest for rural-born children, with risk doubling among town-
    born children and trebling among city-born children10. This and other studies
    highlight the importance of environmental exposures in early life for the
    development of asthma in later childhood5, 11.
    Asthma and anxiety disorders are positively associated among children, adolescents
    and adults12, 13. The reasons for this have not been fully resolved, resulting in an on-
    gong chicken and egg debate on which comes first, with some authors suggesting a
    bidirectional relationship14, 15. In addition, a third alternative to possibly explain the
    positive association between anxiety disorders and asthma has been suggested as
    shared liability, through shared environmental exposures16. There is a scarcity of data
    on anxiety disorders and asthma among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. We
                                                                                                                         3|Page

    investigated the associations between anxiety disorders and asthma among
    adolescents in urban Uganda, and the associations between reported exposures in
    early life and anxiety disorders in adolescents.
    Methods
    Study design and enrolment procedures
    This study was nested within a larger asthma case-control study that has previously
    been reported10. Briefly, the parent case-control study enrolled schoolchildren, 5-17
    years, with and without asthma, from schools in Wakiso District, an urban area in
    central Uganda. The study was conducted from May 2015 to July 2017, and aimed
    to recruit all schoolchildren with asthma and a random sample of two non-asthma
    controls for each case. For this nested study, we collected data on anxiety disorders
    from adolescents (12-17 years) who enrolled into the parent case-control study
    between the months of March and August 2016. This data collection involved
    answering additional questions to diagnose anxiety disorders (details below),
    administered by two experienced psychiatric clinical officers (PCOs), supervised by a
    clinical psychologist and psychiatrist. We defined adolescents as children 12-17 years
    of age (World Health Organisation definition is 10-19 years17); 12 years was the
    required minimum age for the key diagnostic tool for anxiety disorders (below) and
    17 years was the upper age limit for the parent case-control study10.
    Definition of anxiety disorders
    We used the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition
    (DSM-5) referenced instrument, the Youth Inventory-4R (YI-4R), to diagnose anxiety
    disorders18. The Y1-4R is a youth-reported scale that provides invaluable insight into
    how youth perceive their problems. The symptom/sign and impairment items, and
    how these were scored to generate the diagnostic categories, as well as the
    reliability and validity of this scale among young people in Uganda has been
    reported previously19. For this paper, we focused on three anxiety disorders whose
    onset typically occurs during adolescence including generalized anxiety disorder
                                                                                                                         4|Page

    (GAD), panic disorder and social anxiety disorder2. On average, assessment with the
    YI-4R scale lasted for approximately 45 minutes. Any adolescents who required
    psychiatric management received initial attention from the psychiatric clinical officers
    and were referred for further management, appropriately.
    Asthma diagnosis and control
    Adolescents were screened for asthma using the International Study of Asthma and
    Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire20. Adolescents with a history of
    wheezing in the last 12 months underwent a clinical assessment by study clinicians
    which involved detailed medical and treatment history to diagnose asthma10. In
    addition, we assessed asthma control in the last four weeks using the childhood
    Asthma Control Test (cACT)21 for 12-year old adolescents and the Asthma Control
    Test (ACT)22 for those aged 13 years and above. Adolescents with no history of
    wheezing or any asthma symptoms were enrolled as non-asthma controls10.
    Additional data collected
    We used questionnaires to collect data from parents or guardians on potential early
    life risk factors such as area of residence at the time of birth (proxy for residence in
    pregnancy), main area of residence at 0-5 years of age for the adolescent, parental
    education and history of allergy. We also collected data from adolescents on
    reported triggers for asthma symptoms. We performed skin prick tests (SPT) for
    allergic sensitisation using seven crude extracts (Dermatophagoides mix of D. farinae
    and D. pteronyssminus, Blomia tropicalis, Blattella germanica, peanut, cat, pollen mix
    of weeds, mould mix of Aspergillus species; ALK Abello, Hoersholm, Denmark), as
    well as a saline negative control and histamine positive control23. We used the
    standard procedures for the SPT procedure as previously described10, 23.
    Ethical considerations
    Adolescents provided written informed assent and their parents or guardians
    provided written informed consent. The consenting process was conducted in either
    English or Luganda (the main language in the study area). The study was conducted
    according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines and obtained ethical approval from
                                                                                                                         5|Page

    two independent bodies: Uganda Virus Research Institute Research and Ethics
    Committee (reference number GC/127/14109/481) and Uganda National Council for
    Science and Technology (reference number HS 1707).
    Statistical methods
    Data were collected on pre-coded paper questionnaires and double entered in
    OpenClinica open source software version 3.1.4 (OpenClinica LLC and collaborators,
    Waltham, MA, USA). Data were analysed in STATA version 15 (StataCorp, Texas,
    USA).
    We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and 95%
    confidence intervals. We adjusted for confounders such as age and sex determined a
    priori; father’s highest education status, as suggested in literature; and for
    adolescents’ residence at birth, where appropriate. Multiple linear regression models
    were fitted for asthma control test scores, and adjusted for confounders as above.
    For the purpose of this analysis, the outcomes in the regression models varied for
    the different analyses: for the association between anxiety disorders and asthma and
    with asthma control, asthma and asthma control scores were considered the
    outcome; for the association between early life risk factors and anxiety disorders,
    anxiety disorders were considered the outcome.
    Results
    The details of the numbers of participants enrolled in the parent case-control study
    have been described elsewhere10. Briefly, 1,702 schoolchildren were enrolled, 562
    with and 1,140 without asthma, from 55 schools in Wakiso. This nested study on
    anxiety disorders enrolled 162 adolescents, 73 with and 89 without asthma; the
    mean age was 14.3 years (range 12 to 17) and 111 (68.5%) of these were girls (girls
    were 55.9% in the parent case-control study).

    The proportion of children reporting anxiety disorders was different for adolescents
    with and without asthma; the overall prevalence of any of the three anxiety disorders
    was higher (46.6%) among adolescents with asthma than among adolescents
    without asthma (21.4%); (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.05, 95% confidence interval
    (CI) 1.50-6.21), Table 1). This difference was particularly strong for general anxiety
    disorder (AOR 5.16, 95% CI 1.71-15.55) and panic disorder (AOR 5.92, 95% CI 2.31-
    15.19), but not for social anxiety disorder (1.68, 95% CI 0.74-3.84, Table 1).

    Risk factors associated with anxiety disorders

    among adolescents. We found that adolescents with anxiety disorders, compared to
    their counterparts without, were more likely to have been born in an urban area
    (than rural; AOR 3.42, 95% CI 1.29-9.09); raised in an urban area for their first five
    years of life (AOR 2.87, 95% CI 1.07-7.66); have fathers with tertiary education

    Given the observed importance of area of residence in early life, father’s education
    status and adolescent’s asthma as risk factors for anxiety disorders, we explored how
    the different combinations of risk factors were associated with anxiety disorders.
    Firstly, compared to adolescents born in the rural areas and whose fathers had only
    primary or secondary education (reference group), adolescents born in urban areas
    and whose fathers had a tertiary education had the highest risk of anxiety disorders

    In order to investigate further the hypothesis that both anxiety disorders and asthma
    may be due to shared early-life exposures, we additionally adjusted for urban
    residence at birth in the regression model assessing the association between anxiety
    disorders and asthma. We saw the newly adjusted odds ratio go towards the null
    value; compared to values in Table 1, the newly adjusted odds ratios reduced to 2.68
    (95% CI 1.30-5.53) for any of three anxiety disorders, 4.49 (95% CI 1.48-13.56) for
    GAD, 5.43 (95% CI 2.11-14.02) for panic disorder, and 1.46 (95% CI 0.63-3.37) for
    social anxiety disorder. Thus, providing support for the “shared exposure” hypothesis.
    Psychological triggers for asthma and residence in early life
    Given the positive association between anxiety disorders and urban residence in
    early life, we conducted an exploratory analysis to investigate the association
    between reporting psychological triggers for asthma and area of residence in early
    life, among all adolescents with asthma enrolled in the parent case-control study

    Discussion
    We observed a positive association between anxiety disorders and asthma among
    adolescents in urban Uganda. We also found that adolescents with both asthma and
    anxiety disorders had had poorer asthma control than asthmatics without anxiety
    disorders. Additionally, early life risk factors associated with anxiety disorders among
    adolescents were similar to risk factors for asthma that we described previously,
    including urban residence in early life (compared to rural), parental tertiary
    education (compared to secondary or lower education), and adolescents’ own
    history of other allergy-related diseases10. The positive associations between anxiety

    disorders and asthma among adolescents were of similar magnitude to those
    previously reported from high-income countries12, 13.
    Although the temporal relationship between anxiety disorders and asthma is not yet
    clearly understood, this study has demonstrated that both conditions share risk
    factors in early life. Of particular interest was the observation that the risk of anxiety
    disorders among adolescents in urban Uganda was related to their residence in early
    life, with the highest risk among adolescents born and raised in the urban areas. This
    is similar to what we described for asthma previously: compared to schoolchildren in
    urban Uganda who were born and raised rural areas, the risk of asthma was double
    among adolescents born and raised in any town and triple among the city born and
    raised10. Indeed, the highest risk for both conditions seems to be among
    schoolchildren born and raised in urban area whose parent had a tertiary education.
    These results suggest that the positive association between anxiety disorders and
    asthma during adolescence may have its roots in early life, perhaps due to shared
    environmental risk factors (and possibly underlying causes) in urban areas, different
    from exposures in rural areas. This hypothesis of shared environmental factors in
    early life is also supported by twin studies from Europe which have shown familial
    aggregation of both anxiety disorders and asthma among children, which could not
    be explained by genetic factors16.
    Several studies in LMICs have consistently found a higher prevalence of asthma
    among children and adults in urban than rural areas, but the specific causative
    environmental exposures have not been identified9. It is likely that several
    environmental factors are at play, and initial ecological studies to decipher these
    have reported that lifestyle and socioeconomic factors have stronger overall effects
    on asthma prevalence than infrastructure factors9, 25. Indeed, there is increasing
    evidence for adverse effects of exposure to psychosocial factors in early life on
    increased risk of both asthma and anxiety disorders in later childhood: several
    studies have found that maternal anxiety disorders and parenting difficulties were
    positively associated with anxiety disorders in childhood11, 26, 27, and that maternal
    prenatal and postnatal psychosocial distress, and parenting difficulties were
                                                                                                                       13 | P a g e

    associated with increased risk of asthma (and allergy-related diseases) in childhood11,
    28-31. Most studies investigating the adverse role of parental psychosocial distress on
    childhood asthma have been conducted in high-income countries, with only one
    study from sub-Saharan Africa that was conducted in South Africa32. It is important
    to investigate whether psychosocial distress or parenting difficulties are higher
    among urban dwellers than their rural counterparts in LMICs, and whether this could
    possibly contribute to the observed increased prevalence of asthma in urban areas.
    Such information would be vital in informing the design of intervention studies for
    the primary and secondary prevention of both anxiety disorders and asthma among
    children.
    The observation of a positive association between anxiety disorders and poor
    asthma control has been made elsewhere33, 34. Since there was no follow-up in this
    study, temporality cannot be assumed. Nonetheless, this and the observation that a
    quarter of adolescents with asthma reported their symptoms were triggered by
    psychological factors (such as fear, anxiety, sadness, or excitement), emphasises the
    need to manage the two conditions concurrently, in order to improve asthma
    control and to minimise the frequency of asthma attacks. This may include the
    routine screening of asthmatics for anxiety disorders and the proper management of
    the latter35.
    The parent study in which we nested this study was designed as an asthma
    prevalence case-control study, and therefore asthmatics were overrepresented
    compared to a general population. Therefore, we cannot estimate the population
    prevalence of anxiety disorders. The first study limitation was a lack of data on
    current residence (although adolescents were attending schools in urban Uganda, it
    is possible the rural-born adolescents return to rural areas during the school holiday
    and urban-born return to urban areas). The second limitation was the relatively small
    sample size which meant that we had reduced power for some analyses.
    Nevertheless, within the relatively small group of adolescents, we have been able to
    contribute data from Africa on the co-morbidity between anxiety disorders and
    asthma among adolescents. We also make the intriguing observation of a positive
                                                                                                                       14 | P a g e

    trend towards adolescents who reported psychological distress/excitement as a
    trigger for asthma being more likely to have been raised in the urban than rural
    areas. Are psychological triggers for asthma symptoms a manifestation of anxiety-
    related responses to learned threats that may be more prevalent in urban that rural
    areas? More studies will expand our understanding of the relationship between
    anxiety disorders and asthma.
    Conclusion
    We confirm a positive association between asthma and anxiety disorders among
    adolescents in urban Uganda. In addition, we demonstrate a close similarity in early
    life risk factors associated with both anxiety disorders and with asthma among
    adolescents, suggesting shared underlying causes. This also implies that looking
    closely at the causes of anxiety disorders will provide more insight into the causes of
    asthma. More research is required to identify the adverse environmental factors in
    the urban areas in LMICs that increase both anxiety disorders and asthma, identify
    underlying mechanisms, and inform intervention studies for the prevention.
