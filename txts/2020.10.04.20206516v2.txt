    Abstract
    Background
    The rising number of trials on repurposed dugs in COVID-19 has led to duplication and a need
    for curation of available outcomes from treatments that have been followed across the world.
    We have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that focus on evaluating the clinical
    outcomes of repurposed interventions against COVID-19.
    Methods
    Random effects model was adopted to estimate overall treatment effect and heterogeneity. Meta-
    regression was performed to study the correlation between comorbid conditions and non-
    invasive or invasive ventilation requirement.
        NOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.

    Results
    Twenty-nine articles met our eligibility criteria. In subgroup analysis, Tocilizumab was highly
    significant with lower mortality rate (OR 27.50; 95%CI [5.39-140.24]) of severe COVID-19
    patients. Hydroxychloroquine and Lopinavir-ritonavir was found to be inefficacious in severe
    patients (OR 0.64; 95%CI [0.47-0.86] and 1.40 [0.71-2.76]). Dexamethasone had marginal effect
    on overall mortality rate (OR 1.19; 95%CI [1.05-1.35]). The meta-regression shows a positive
    correlation between prevalence of patients on Tocilizumab in non invasive support and
    hypertension condition (P = 0.02), whereas a negative correlation was identified with patients
    having lung disease (P = 0.03).
    Conclusion
    Overall, our study confirmed that tocilizumab may probably reduce the mortality rate (<10%) of
    severe COVID-19 patients than other interventions. Further, reduce the risk of requiring non-
    invasive ventilator support in patients with comorbid condition of lung disease.
    Hydroxychloroquine and Lopinavir-ritonavir has no clinical benefits in severe COVID-19. A
    high quality evidence is required to evaluate the usage of Serpin + Favipiravir combination in
    severe or critical COVID-19.

    1. Introduction
    The first incidence of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in patients with severe
    respiratory disease in Wuhan, China. Since then, COVID-19 outbreak has grown to 32.7 million
    cases resulting in 991,224 deaths as on 27th September, 2020 across the world. The effect of and
    response to the virus is varied based on the immune systems [1] environment risks [2], pre-
    existing health conditions [3, 4], sex differences [5] and so on across different populations and
    different countries. The virus has debilitated the global community and will continue to do so
    until an effective vaccine or antiviral is developed.
    The ability of the virus to spread rapidly, causing increased risk of deaths in patients with
    existing health conditions has been considered to be the most alarming feature of COVID-[6,7]
    At present, there are no targeted therapies or vaccines available for COVID-19. Based on
    previous outbreaks like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003
    [8–10] and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 [11–13],
    medical community has been working swiftly by repurposing the drugs and evaluating their
    efficacy in the treatment of the novel coronavirus. Current treatments are primarily based on
    factors such as combination of drugs, disease severity and respiratory support. Treatment
    paradigms follow WHO guidelines or those offered by health authorities in each country. Drugs
    such as Hydroxycholoroquine (HCQ) which were initially reported to be effective in treatment
    were later found to have limited effects [14]. Later analyses have shown other immune therapies,
    repurposed antivirals have positive effects on patients in particular phases of treatment [15,16].
    Lack of specific treatment and drug therapies for COVID-19, has led the scientific and medical
    communities to run several drug trials in the past seven months. These studies generated a huge

    collection of data regarding the drug efficacy, adverse effects and its specificity towards certain
    populations. The aim of this study is to design and implement a data driven meta-analysis of
    existing literature and available outcomes regarding treatment for novel coronavirus. We have
    explored the effect of emerging treatments widely followed by present medical guidelines across
    countries including drugs like Tocilizumab (TCZ), Remdesivir (RM), Favipiravir (FPV),
    Dexamethasone (DM), Lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV-r) and Convalescent Plasma (CP) therapy on
    patients at different severity levels of COVID-19. In addition, we have attempted to manifest the
    correlation of drug’s ability to treat patients on invasive and non-invasive oxygen support with
    comorbid conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. We believe that
    our findings may help the medical and scientific community to better understand the association
    of temporal relationships of drug usage during different stages of disease on patients with pre-
    existing health conditions.
    2.    Materials and Methods
    We report a systematic review and meta-analysis, as per the recommendations of PRISMA
    (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statements [17]. Our
    work has not been registered under PROSPERO.
    2.1       Search Strategy and Study Selection
    We systematically searched databases including PubMed, medRxiv and Scopus for research
    articles published from anytime up to 1st August, 2020. An advanced search was performed with
    the following keywords: (Remdesivir OR Favipiravir OR Lopinavir/Ritonavir OR Tocilizumab
    OR Dexamethasone OR Convalescent Plasma OR Hydroxychloroquine OR Arbidol OR
    Corticosteroids) AND (“COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “2019 nCoV”) AND (Moderate

    OR Severe OR Critically ill OR Hospitalized OR Oxygen Therapy OR Invasive Mechanical
    Ventilation). The drug names in the keywords were selected from the World Health Organization
    (https://www.who.int/), Indian Council of Medical Research (https://www.icmr.gov.in/), and
    Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/) COVID-19 protocol
    guidelines. Additionally, we screened the references of the included articles to obtain more
    relevant papers for the study.
    The following articles were excluded from the analysis: duplicates, review papers, editorials,
    letters, comments, other language manuscripts and studies tested on in-vitro cell culture and in-
    vivo animals. Inclusion criteria for the study were: i) randomized (RCT) or non-randomized
    clinical trials (nRCT), prospective or retrospective observational studies (cohort study and case
    series) ii) research articles, preprints and preliminary reports with comparators (Treatment Vs.
    Control) or combination of treatment modalities or studies without control group iii) study
    population could be any age, sex and any region in the world, diagnosed with COVID-19 with
    either laboratory test-confirmed or Chest computer tomography (CT) iv) any one of these
    outcomes reported: mortality rate, recovery rate, viral clearance period, clinical improvement of
    patients in oxygen therapy or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) after drug treatment.
    2.2       Data extraction
    Data extracted from the included study articles were updated on a google spreadsheet. Any
    ambiguity in data extraction was clarified by discussion and consensus of the authors. Clinical
    insights were consistently sought. The following features were extracted: author, study type, date
    of publication, study period, study place, drug name, cohort size, gender, age, severity condition
    (mild, moderate, severe and critical); treatment combination, time from symptom onset to the

    treatment, dosage details; precondition of patients (PaO2:FiO2 and SpO2 levels), comorbidity,
    patients requiring respiratory support such as low flow oxygen support, high flow or Non-
    Invasive mechanical Ventilation (NIV), IMV or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
    (during admission and follow-up); clinical improvement length, viral clearance period; mortality
    rate; recovery rate and adverse effects. All the data were individually extracted for subgroups
    (treatment group, control or comparator) and overall outcomes of all the treatments were
    summarized together and plotted using ggplot2 [18] in R.
    2.3       Risk of bias assessment
    We used RoB 2.0 [19] and ROBINS-I [20] tools of Cochrane risk of bias assessment for
    evaluating RCTs and observational or nRCTs. Robvis package [21] from R was used for the
    visualization of risk bias assessment. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was used to assess
    single-arm studies [22]. The use of this scale is more sensible to control the quality level of the
    cohort study [23].
    2.4       Statistical analysis
    To evaluate the drug treatment effects between control and test groups, an odds ratio was
    obtained to measure probability of events occurring between groups at different disease severity
    levels. The intervention effect distribution was estimated using the Random Effects Model
    (REM), which is provided as an estimate of 95% confidence interval. I2 statistic was used to
    measure heterogeneity within and between studies. This was performed using metafor package
    V2.4.0 [24] in R V4.0.2. Overall proportion of all single armed studies were calculated using
    metaprop [25] program in R. Meta-regression was performed to assess the correlation of drug
    efficacy in patients at different oxygen therapy stages with comorbid conditions using lm

    function in R. A p-value of ≤ 0.05 is considered as statistically significant in all our studies
    unless stated.
    3. Results
    Overall, 15,831 records were identified by our searches. On removing redundant entries, 3095
    numbers of papers were retained. After exclusion of review articles, 29 clinical studies (24
    published and 5 pre-prints) met our eligibility criteria (PRISMA flow chart Figure 1). All these
    were available online between 11th March, 2020 and 22nd July, 2020. After definitive selection
    of articles, there were eight therapeutic agents in total found from 29 studies having 14,114
    COVID-19 patients involved were compared in our meta-analysis. These eight agents included
    TCZ (trialed on 684 participants), CP (95), RM (158), DM (2104), HCQ (912), LPV-r (215),
    Arbidol (137), FPV (2383) and Standard care or placebo (6344). Nine (6 published and 3 pre-
    prints) of 29 included studies were single-arm trials without a comparator. The description of the
    participants, treatment, clinical outcomes and the key findings of all the included studies are
    presented in Table 1.
    3.1       Risk of bias assessment
    The risk of bias score evaluated for 29 included studies comprising 12 RCTs, 1 nRCT, and 16
    observational (12 retrospective, 3 prospective and 1 case series). The risks of bias for
    randomized and non-randomized are presented in Figure 2a and Figure 2b respectively. Risk of
    bias for single-group studies was assessed using NOS is given in Table S1. The overall
    judgments for 15 studies were high risk or poor quality, 10 at moderate or fair quality and 4 at
    low risk of bias (Last column of Table 1).

    3.2       Subgroup analyses based on disease severity levels
    By pooling articles based on disease severity levels, studies were subgrouped as
    1) mild/moderate 2) severe (Figure 3). Odds ratio of mortality rate for studies including
    mild/moderate patients found to have higher 95% Confidence Interval (CI), P Value of 1.00 with
    I2 = 0% indicating no observed heterogeneity. However, articles with patients at high risk/severe
    disease symptoms showed P Value < 0.001 and heterogeneity measure (I2) of 87.5%. Most of the
    studies classified under severe subgroups had small 95% CI and showed positive effects of drugs
    in the treatment group. On the other hand, a greater part of studies under mild/moderate sub-
    group indicated the null effect of the drug on the treatment group with long 95% CI.

    Squares on the right and left side of the line favor the test and control group respectively.
    Diamond shows an overall summary of all studies
    Of all the drugs included in the severe subgroup, TCZ was found to perform well on patients at
    high risk (OR 27.50 [5.39-140.24]; 2.70 [0.82-8.94]) [26,27], followed by CP therapy (OR 2.12
    [0.70-6.38]; 1.70 [0.63-4.59]) [28,29]. Of two articles published on RM, one showed less
    response on treatment group [30] (OR 1.81 [1.15-2.83]) while other had null effect (OR 0.91
    [0.41-2.03]) [31]. The failure of the latter trial on Remdesivir is due to the small sample size with
    2:1 randomisation. Both the studies showed an insignificant mortality rate between control and
    test groups [30,31]. DM had a marginal positive effect on overall mortality (OR 1.19 [1.05-
    1.35]) [32]. HCQ showed negative effects on treatment groups under severe conditions (OR 0.64
    [0.47-0.86]). This study [33] on HCQ had a large cohort (n=1376) of hospitalized COVID-19
    patients and suggests that HCQ use had no potency for end stage intubation or death. Overall,
    REM for all studies from all subgroups showed a significant P Value of 0.001 and heterogeneity
    measure (I2) of 72.2%.
    3.2       Single-group study analysis
    Figure 4 shows a visual summary of a patient's mortality from different drug trial studies with no
    placebo/control. The results of included single armed studies, with 95% C.I and the pooled
    proportions are provided. Overall effect of drugs on COVID-19 patients showed a significant
    mortality proportion of 0.12 (P < 0.01) with heterogeneity measure (I2) of 72%. Most of the
    included studies had lower mortality proportion (< 0.1) except two studies on TCZ [34,35]

    3.3       Factors associated with the prevalence of patients in different oxygen therapies.
    We performed meta-regression analysis to understand the association of factors influencing a
    patient's dependency on life supporting ventilation treatments. A set of variables that may likely
    influence the COVID-19 patients landing into non-invasive and invasive oxygen supports were
    identified. The variables included were time from symptom onset to treatment, treatment
    duration, mortality rate and comorbidities of patients (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, lung
    disease and renal disease). Of all the drugs included, TCZ and RM had enough number of studies
    (14) with potentially relevant oxygen support information (supplemental oxygen/ NIV/ IMV) to
    carry out the analysis. Results showing the multivariate meta-regression for all TCZ studies are
    shown in Figure 5. A total of 376 patients were under respiratory support before the treatment,
    and 195 remained at the end of treatment. In this multivariate meta-regression model,

    comorbidities factors showed association with prevalence of patients in non-invasive support
    (Figure 5a and 5b). There was a significant positive correlation between prevalence of patients
    on TCZ in non invasive support and hypertension condition (P = 0.02) (Figure 5b). On the other
    hand, a significant negative correlation with patients having lung disease and their existence in
    non-invasive support was identified (P = 0.03) (Figure 5b). Additionally, patients with pre-
    existing diabetes conditions significantly observed to have no association with their prevalence
    in non-invasive support (P = 0.02) (Figure 5b).

    correlation of patients under invasive therapy with comorbidities
    There was no significant association identified on comparing the patient’s prevalence in invasive
    ventilation supports (ECMO) and its affecting factors. Similar to the non-invasive case, positive
    correlation was observed between the number of patients with hypertension and increased risk of
    falling into invasive oxygen support. On the other hand, patients with diabetes when treated on
    TCZ showed negative correlation with their prevalence in invasive ventilation support.
    Furthermore, patients treated with TCZ under invasive support had no association with early
    treatment onset, and comorbidities conditions including pulmonary, renal and heart diseases.
    Meta-regression on RM revealed no association of the patient population in oxygen therapy with
    any of the dependent variables except time from symptoms onset (data not shown).
    3.4       Combined analysis on comparable clinical outcomes from all studies
    The overall clinical outcomes in control and test for each treatment were compared and
    represented as a bar plot (Figure 6). The percentage of death in the TCZ group was found to be
    lowest (<10%) among all treatments compared in this study. Additionally, patients in the TCZ
    group found to have faster recovery (duration of 7days) than the control group and other
    treatments. Moreover, in the control group many of the patients required invasive support during
    a follow-up (26%) than at the time of admission (15%), whereas a decrease was observed in the
    TCZ treatment (18% admission to 17% follow-up). HCQ was the only test group where the death

    rate relatively scaled up (17%) than in the control group (11%). The clinical outcomes of control
    and test groups from DM studies showed no significant difference (it was specific for significant
    reduction of death in IMV support). Although a shorter duration of clinical improvement was
    observed among TCZ, DM and RM treatments. A good rise in negative conversion rate of the
    viral RNA (during follow-up) was seen in CP (48% Vs. 20%) and FPV (91% Vs. 76%)
    treatments compared to the control group. The studies including RM (20% Vs. 27%) and LPV-r
    (15% Vs. 27%) observed to show lower incidence of severe adverse events, the percentage are
    very much comparable with that of their control group.

      4.    Discussion
    Although mortality rate is 1% of COVID-19 patients [37], it has caused 991,224 deaths till now,
    and no therapeutic agent has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval yet. There
    are many clinical studies reported on repurposed drugs for COVID-19 treatment. This meta-
    analysis indicates 29 of such studies involving 14,114 patients with COVID-19 to assess drug
    efficacy on the key outcomes, including mortality rate, viral clearance, clinical improvement,
    oxygen support, invasive ventilation, comorbid factors (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease,
    lung disease and renal disease) and adverse events.
    According to the pooled results in subgroup analyses, assessing the severity of the disease, TCZ
    is found to be more effective in reducing the mortality rate (OR 27.50 [5.39-140.24]) of severe
    COVID-19 patients (Figure 1). TCZ, an approved antagonist of IL-6 receptor in rheumatoid
    arthritis with moderate to severe condition [38]. This is also considered as a selective cytokine
    inhibitor in COVID-19 [39], where multiple clinical studies have evaluated the safety and
    efficacy of TCZ in the severe stage of the disease.
     In Capraa et al.'s study, a greater significance was seen in survival rate (p=0.004) and 92%
    recovery in TCZ treated patients as compared to the control [26]. But, Campochiaro's study
    reveals no statistical difference in mortality rate (TCZ 15% Vs. control 33%) and clinical
    improvement (69% Vs. 61%), due to small cohort size [27]. In fact, two studies [35,40]
    concluded that early use and low dosage of TCZ has shown to be effective in reducing mortality
    rate, without any adverse events. In spite of that, three retrospective studies on TCZ [34,41,42],
    where 2 studied with cohort-control and 1 with single- arm, managed to show consistent results
    in relation to risk of IMV or death or ICU admission.

    The first study has a larger cohort of 544 serious COVID-19 patients, showing a decrease in
    IMV risk up to 27% in the TCZ group than standard 41.5%. But, this study limits with a residual
    confounding that there were 4 patients with renal insufficiency or cancer in the TCZ group
    whereas it was 15 in the standard [41]. Similarly, the second study even with a smaller cohort
    could observe that TCZ treatment strongly reduces ICU admission or death (25% Vs. 72%, p =
    0.002) or IMV support (0% Vs. 32%, P = 0.006) than standard care in the critically ill COVID-19
    patients [42]. The third single-arm study with 100 patients also shows clinical improvement in
    77% patients having respiratory support or 74% of 43 ICU patients by day-10 [34]. Additionally,
    two studies shows good improvement in the SpO2 levels (89% to 97%, day 1-10) [43] and
    PaO2:FiO2 ratio (152±53 to 302.2 ±126, day 0-14) of TCZ treatment [44].
    A previous systematic review on TCZ reported 28 studies conducted in many different places;
    the results of most of these studies were favorable to TCZ therapy in severe and critically ill
    COVID-19 patients [45]. Based on this, TCZ is safe in treating both early and late stage
    respiratory conditions of COVID-19, but so far, no RCT has been reported in treating the severe
    groups, where the RCT is still on-going to measure the efficacy and safety of this treatment in
    case of severe COVID-19 [46].
    CP is another type of immune therapy that shows less or no significance (OR 2.12 [0.70-6.38];
    1.70 [0.63-4.59]) in the subgrouping of 2 RCTs included. Results from a RCT using CP have
    shown that mortality rate (p=0.95) and improvement of day-15 disease severity (p=0.58) were
    not significant when compared to the standard group. The study also shows that COVID-19
    patients already have enough neutralizing antibody titers than donors and suggests the use of CP
    at early symptom onset [28]. Another RCT also showed similar results, besides, they showed a
    higher significance (87.2% CP Vs. 37.5% standard) in viral load negativity within 72 hrs after CP

    transfusion in severe COVID-19 patients [29]. Limitation in both studies was that they were soon
    terminated before attaining enough sample size which prevented definite conclusions of clinical
    benefits.
    In our post-search, a large RCT done on CP management was found. This enrolled almost 464
    moderately ill COVID-19 patients, and showed results in line with 2 previous RCTs, that
    mortality was not significantly different between CP treated and control groups 14.5% Vs. 13.5%
    [47]. According to these reports, CP therapy has shown to be more efficient in early negative
    conversion of viral RNA, but no effect in reducing the mortality rate of moderate-severe
    COVID-19 patients.
    RM shows less or no significance in our subgroup analyses (OR 1.81 [1.15-2.83]; 0.91 [0.41-
    2.03]. This shows that it is not effective in reducing the mortality rate for severe COVID-19
    patients. Two RCTs with placebo-controlled have been reported, one [30] of which has a larger
    study size with improvised protocol than the other [31]. The first study [30] favors RM (a 10-day
    course) over placebo with short recovery time (11 Vs. 15 days) for all clinical outcomes except
    patients on IMV or ECMO. They further suggest that it is supportive for hospitalized and low
    supplemental oxygen support patients. A second study [31] trialed 2:1 randomization with
    limited sample shows no significant reduction of viral load or duration of clinical improvement
    in severe COVID-19 patients. Both RCTs describe that the mortality rates were insignificant
    between treatment and placebo. Also recommend that RM could be given as an antiviral agent in
    combination with other therapy before the condition progresses to need for IMV [30,31].
    Subsequently, Gein et al. study on compassionate-use of RM, shows 22% death and 70% clinical
    improvement among patients. Also, 50% (25/53) of severe patients with age group 70 or older

    were discharged. However, adverse events occurred in 60% of patients (such as elevated hepatic
    enzymes, rash, hypotension and renal impairment) and serious adverse events in 23% (multiple-
    organ-dysfunction syndrome, acute kidney injury, septic shock and hypotension), which were
    caused by RM treatment alone [48,49].
    Two other studies [50,51], randomized moderate and severe patients with RM for either 5-day or
    10-day courses. The clinical improvement of severe patients (without receiving mechanical
    ventilation) was not significant (64% Vs. 54%) between the two courses [50]. Anyhow, in
    patients with moderate severity, the 5-day course had statistically significant clinical status when
    compared to standard care (OR 1.65 95% CI, 1.09-2.48; p = .02), whereas the 10-day course
    showed no effect [51]. Majority of these study outcomes suggest that RM can be used for
    hospitalized and lower respiratory tract infectious COVID-19 patients.
    Regarding DM, Horby et al. have published a well-designed largest RCT that enrolled the
    highest population size (n=6425), when compared to any other studies included in this meta-
    analysis. The study shows a low dose of DM is most effective in patients on IMV or ECMO than
    without respiratory support, where the risk of death is reduced significantly in DM group than
    usual care (29.3% Vs. 41.4%) of critically ill COVID-19 patients. However, the overall mortality
    rate of all groups including those without respiratory support does not seem to have much
    difference (22.9% Vs. 25.7%) [32], which is why the subgroup analysis in our study shows a
    marginal effect in mortality rate (OR 1.19 [1.05-1.35]). Therefore, DM could be recommended in
    treating long term symptom COVID-19 patients, requiring IMV than recent symptom onset.
    The studies on HCQ and antivirals (LPV-r, arbidol, FPV) in mild-moderate subgroups show a
    null effect (OR 1.10 [0.29-4.11]) (Figure 1), since no event of death occurred in both control and

    treatment groups. However, many other clinical outcomes related to these drugs are reported by
    the trials. HCQ, an anti-malarial agent presumed to exert antiviral and immunomodulating
    effects in COVID-19. But, Geleris et al. studied a large cohort (n=1376) of hospitalized COVID-
    19 patients, suggested that HCQ use had no potency for end stage intubation or death (hazard
    ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.32) [33]. This study had a poor score (OR 0.64 [0.47-0.86]) in the
    severe subgroup (Figure 1). Two RCTs from China studied HCQ with a small number of mild-
    moderate patients. The first is a preprint [52] and only partially confirmed the drug effect on
    symptomatic outcome (like fever and cough). The other study [53] shows no significance in viral
    clearance between HCQ plus standard Vs. standard alone treatment, in addition, more adverse
    events were found high in HCQ group. Recent research shows HCQ inhibits trained immunity by
    an epigenetic modulation. This prevents the antiviral effects of the bodily innate immune
    response against the SARS-CoV-2 infection [54]. Together, these results indicate that HCQ is
    not a promising rescue option for mild-moderate and severe COVID-19 patients.
    LPV-r or Arbidol alone shows little benefit for clinical outcome of mild-moderate COVID-19
    patients [55], but Deng’s study showed that combined effect is more favorable [56]. A
    retrospective study commends, LPV-r has a more rapid effect in viral clearance than HCQ [57].
    Although Cao et al. performed a RCT on LPV-r found no benefit in mortality reduction or
    receiving oxygen support in case of severe COVID-19 patients. Thus no effect was seen in the
    mortality rate (OR 1.40 [0.71-2.76]) of the severe subgroup (Figure 1). Their finding says the
    positive viral RNA appeared till the end of trial in LPV-r group (40.7%), but it was not
    confirmed with the presence of viral infection. The study limits without blinding which might
    have influenced the outcome and premature discontinuation (14%) of the treatment [58].

    Therefore, the LPV-r treatment seems to have antiviral benefits during mild COVID-19
    condition but has no benefit in mortality reduction.
    FPV is an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of viral RNA, evaluated by in-vitro
    studies to be active against COVID-19. An observational study with 2158 COVID-19 patients,
    studied FPV use on compassionate basis. They show mortality was higher in the severe group
    (31.7%) when compared to mild (5.1%) and moderate (12.7%) by day-30. Likewise, the rate of
    recovery was lower in the severe group (14.7%) than the other two conditions (61.7% and
    42.7%). Also, deaths were frequent in elderly and 24.65% of patients posed adverse events with
    FPV therapy. The study unfortunately is limited since it contains no background data of patients
    though they are registered from 407 hospitals [59]. A study in Thailand [36] favors the use of
    FPV with 100% of clinical improvement in 27 hospitalized patients (without oxygen support)
    and 83.3% in 30 serious conditions (requiring supplemental oxygen or IMV) at day 28.
    However, the study is limited by the use of additional agents such as chloroquine and hence
    could not find the actual impact of FPV. Another study [60] shows, by day-7, FPV had no
    difference in recovery rate when compared with Arbidol therapy for moderate COVID-19
    patients.
    Synthetic serine protease inhibitors (serpins) were earlier used to treat diseases like Acute
    myocardial infarction, Ischemic stroke and Pulmonary embolism [61]. More recently
    Nafamostat, a Serpin was found to prevent the proteolytic activity of transmembrane protease
    serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and thus inhibits the viral fusion with the host cells [62,63]. The
    combination of two therapies (serpin and FPV), may allow the inhibition of viral entry as well as
    the replication. A small case series shows that FPV in combination with Nafamostat was found
    to have benefits on severe COVID-19. In which, 8 of 11 patients were extubated and 9

    discharged from ICU. But still there is no convincing evidence supporting this study [64]. Taken
    together, FPV use is efficacious in mild-moderate COVID-19 patients. But for severe or
    critically ill conditions, the addition of Serpins with the FPV may be helpful.
    In summary i) TCZ is effective in severe COVID-19, but requires a RCT to validate the results.
    ii) DM works only on patients with IMV in reducing mortality, however several unresolved
    questions still exist. iii) RM benefits patients without having IMV support with shorter recovery
    time. iv) CP and LPV-r can cure only mild illness and CP was found to be efficacious in bringing
    down the viral load in at least hours. Both have no benefit in mortality reduction v) HCQ has no
    potency or antiviral effects. vi) FPV when used in combination with serpins found to have
    additive effects on severe COVID-19, but more findings are required to assess the drug
    tolerability.
    One previous meta-analysis [65] was reported already on repurposed drugs by June 9 (pre-print),
    however the current study has added more therapeutic agents with its recent trials including a
    huge number of patients. Our study is bound by limitations of much high risk quality evidence.
    In addition, a few non-comparable single-arm studies and smaller cohorts are underpowered to
    assess the clinical outcomes that were addressed.
    5. Conclusion
    Based on the available evidence, this analysis has found immunotherapy (TCZ) was superior to
    antivirals in most of the clinical outcomes. TCZ has promising effect in both early and late stages
    of disease severity. Although, the RCT with TCZ and other monoclonal antibody cocktails in the
    6-arm RECOVERY clinical trial (NCT04381936) are still on-going, the results of which may
    provide an optimal dosage and safety details for an appropriate benefit of the therapy. The meta-

    regression analysis shows TCZ exposure in patients with hypertension comorbid condition had a
    significant correlation with risk of non-invasive oxygen support (P=0.02). On the other hand,
    lung diseases (comorbidity) had lower chance of requiring non-invasive support. A low dose
    corticosteroid (DM) had only a marginal effect on overall motarlity rate. However, based on the
    evidence, it is a good rescue option for patients on IMV. HCQ was found to have no clinical
    effects for COVID-19, whereas it plays a role in inhibiting the trained immune system. LPV-r,
    not efficacious in severe COVID-19, yet has some antiviral effects in mild conditions. The use of
    CP rapidly reduces viral load within a few hours in all stages of COVID-19. The results of HCQ
    and LPV-r were in line with the partially reported recent 6-arm trial (NCT04381936). The
    Antivirals RM and FPV were recommended as a combinatorial therapy with other agents. A 10-
    day course of RM has speedy recovery in hospitalized patients (without IMV) and a 5-day course
    is safe in moderate COVID-19. FPV alone treats patients before the end stage of COVID-19
    patients. But the combinatorial use of Serpins with FPV may be efficacious for even critical
    patients. Furthermore, high quality evidence is required to evaluate its usage in severe or critical
    COVID-19.
