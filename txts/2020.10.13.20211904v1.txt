    Title
    Background and concurrent factors predicting non-adherence to public health preventive measures
    during the chronic phase of the COVID-19 pandemic
    Abstract
    To determine factors that predict non-adherence to preventive measures for COVID-19 during the
    chronic phase of the pandemic, a cross-sectional, general population survey was conducted in Israel.
    Sociodemographic, health-related, behavioral, and COVID-19-related characteristics were
    collected. Among 2055 participants, non-adherence was associated with male gender, young age,
    bachelorhood, being employed, lower decrease in income, low physical activity, psychological
    distress, ADHD symptoms, past risk-taking and anti-social behavior, low pro-sociality, perceived
    social norms favoring non-adherence, low perceived risk of COVID-19, low perceived efficacy of
    the preventive measures, and high perceived costs of adherence to the preventive measures. There
    appears to be a need for setting out and communicating preventive measures to specifically targeted
    at-risk populations.
                                                                         1

    Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has an enormous impact on public health and global
    economy. In response to the growing pandemic, most states took preventive measures to limit the
    spread of cases through community transmission of COVID-19. These measures included isolation
    of infected and suspected patients, use of personal protective equipment (face masks, gloves etc.),
    personal hygiene, restrictions on gathering and traveling, social distancing, as well as mandatory
    quarantine and lockdown (1). Some of the preventive measures depend on how people cooperate,
    i.e. whether they adhere to the measures or not (2).
    Despite the potentially harmful consequences for individuals and public health, non-adherence to
    the preventive measures (non-APM) for the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly at the acute phase, has
    been reported around the world (3-7). For designing effective public health policy, it is mandatory
    to identify the factors that predict non-APM. Recently, several cross-sectional surveys were
    conducted, in an effort to identify predictors of APM during the early phases of the pandemic. For
    instance, immediately after the detection of the first COVID-19 patient in Hong-Kong, higher levels
    of adoption of social-distancing measures were associated with being female, living in the
    geographic regions in Hong Kong that share the border with mainland China, perceiving oneself as
    having a good understanding of COVID-19, and being more anxious (7). In a survey conducted in
    Israel in April 2020, male gender, not having children, high levels of ADHD symptoms, smoking,
    past risk-taking behavior, and current psychological distress levels, all predicted non-APM. On the
    other hand, pro-sociality, understanding of the instructions, high perceived risk of COVID-19, and
    high perceived efficacy of the preventive measures predicted adherence (5).
    As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, preventive measures become a constant part of our life. The
    objective of this study was to identify predictors of non-APM at the chronic phase of the pandemic.
    The literature suggests different conceptualizations of non-APM. Firstly, preventive measures are
    prescribed by health agencies and therefore can be considered medical instructions and healthy
    lifestyle. Secondly, non-APM might endanger the non-adherent and his/her vicinity, and
    consequently should be considered as a risk-taking behavior. Finally, preventive measures are often
    set as laws or regulations, implying that non-APM often means illicit behavior. Potential predictors
    of non-APM were chosen for this study based on the literatures regarding the risk factors for non-
    adherence to medical instructions (8), engagement in risk-taking behavior (9, 10), and engagement
    in anti-social behavior (11). These included four groups of variables: 1. Sociodemographic factors:
    age, gender, marital status, parenthood, ethnicity, religiousness, education, place of living,
                                                                        2

    background migration, pre-outbreak and current level of income, pre-outbreak and current percent
    of position. 2. Health factors: healthy lifestyle (daily hours of sleep, smoking, physical activity),
    medical risk factors for COVID-19, subjective health, psychological distress, attention-
    deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. 3. Behavioral and personality factors: past risk-
    taking behavior, past anti-social behavior, level of pro-sociality. 4. Perceptions regarding the
    COVID-19 and the preventive measures: the perceived risk of COVID-19, the perceived efficacy of
    the preventive measures, the perceived norms regarding APM, and the perceived cost of APM.
    Methods
    This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Seymour Fox School of Education at the
    Hebrew University of Jerusalem. From May 13 to 23, 2020, a sample of 2055 online panel
    respondents (https://www.panel4all.co.il) representing most of the adult Israeli population was
    recruited.
    For the primary outcome measure, non-APM, respondents were asked to rate the extent of which
    they adhered to each of the 13 preventive measures that were released by the Israeli Ministry of
    Health at the corresponding period (e.g. social distancing, personal hygiene, facemask). A five-
    point Likert scale was used: 1=„Not at all‟, 2=„Somewhat‟, 3=„Moderately‟, 4=„Strictly‟, and
    5=„Very strictly‟. Individual mean response scores were calculated.
    Measures
    The following scales were used to measure the independent variables:
    1. Sociodemographic factors: Respondents completed a questionnaire consisting of items regarding
    age, gender, marital status, number of children, ethnicity, religious affiliation and level of
    observance, type of education, place of living (country region, and type of community), and
    background migration. In addition, respondent reported on pre-treatment level of income (much
    above average, above average, average, below average, much below average), level of decrease in
    income since the onset of the coronavirus outbreak (on a 1 = not at all to 5 = extreme decrease
    Likert scale), and pre-treatment and current percent of position.
    2. Health factors: Respondents were asked to report on their average number of daily hours of sleep,
    frequency of engaging in intensive physical activity, and smoking habits. They also reported
    whether they are chronically treated or followed up for any of the following reasons (that are
                                                                        3

    considered risk factors for COVID-19 (12)): heart disease, lung disease, liver disease, AIDS,
    cancer, organ transplantation, diabetes, dialysis, steroid treatment, and prophylactic antibiotic
    treatment. Subjective health was probed by a single-item self-rated health (SRH) Likert scale
    describing their own health impression, ranging from 1 = poor to 10= excellent. This scale was
    found to reflect individuals‟ perceptions of their physical health and psychological well-being (13).
    An adapted version of the Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K6) was used to
    probe for non-specific psychological distress (14). For the purpose of the current study, only the
    first part of the scale was used, in which respondents rated on a five-level Likert scale (1 = „All the
    time‟, 5 = „None of the time‟) the level of six psychiatric common symptoms during the period of
    the COVID-19 crisis. The questionnaire is sensitive to high levels of mental distress (Kessler et al.,
    200, 2010(, and is used in the annual US National Health Interview Survey (15). The Hebrew
    version of the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRSv1.1) (16, 17) was used to measure the level
    of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. A total score of ASRS was created
    by averaging the responses to all 18 items. For both the K6 and the ASRS, average scores were
    dichotomized at the clinical suggested cutoff (14, 16).
    3. Behavioral and personality factors: The pro-social subscale of the young adult Strengths and
    Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (18, 19) was used for measuring pro-sociality. Respondents rated
    the extent to which a series of six attributes described them during six months reference period on a
    three-level response scale (0 = „not true‟, 1 = „somewhat true‟, or 2 = „certainly true‟). A short form
    of the Adult Risk-Taking Inventory (ARTI) (20, 21) was used to measure past engagement in risky
    behavior. The short form consists of 14 items probing for the frequency of engagement in relatively
    frequent activities (e.g., sunbathing without sunscreen, smoking marijuana) with respect to their
    frequency during the preceding year on a rating scale, ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 7 (On a daily
    basis). Previous work has shown that the ARTI has good reliability and validity. Past anti-social
    behavior was assessed using 15-item 4-point frequency scale, ranging from 1 = Not at all to 4 =
    More than 5 times, adapted from Cho et al. (22). For each of the three scales, the average
    continuous scores were converted to categorical scores by grouping values into four groups with
    quartiles as cutoff points.
    4. COVID-19-related perception factors: Perceptions regarding the COVID-19 and the preventive
    measures were assessed using several five-point Likert scales: Perceived risk of COVID-19 was
    assessed by a nine-item self-report questionnaire that was designed for this study based on the risk
                                                                        4

    perception literature (23). For example, “How likely are you to get COVID-19?”. In this sample, the
    scale had good internal consistency (Cronbach‟s α = .80). Perceived efficacy of the prevent measure
    scale was measured by a self-report questionnaire designed for this study. The scale consists of five
    items was composed for measuring participants‟ perceived efficacy of the instructions. For
    example, “To what extent you think that adhering to the preventive measures will reduce the
    chances that you or your loved ones will get COVI-19?”. In this sample, the scale had good internal
    consistency (Cronbach‟s α = .83). Another scale composed for this study, consisted of seven items
    probing for the perceived costs of APM, including the perceived cost of APM on different domains
    of wellbeing (e.g., economic, social, spiritual). For example, “To what extent adhering to the
    preventive measures will impair your interpersonal relationship?”. In this sample, the scale had
    good internal consistency (Cronbach‟s α = .84). Perceived norms regarding APM were measured by
    four questions regarding the descriptive (i.e., the prevalence of non-APM) and the injunctive (i.e.,
    the tolerance toward non-APM) norms of the family/friends and the community/workplace they are
    embedded in.
    Analytic approach
    First, unadjusted logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the associations between each
    of the independent variables and the primary outcome. Next, four adjusted models were examined
    using backward stepwise logistic regressions with probability of 0.05 for entry and 0.1 for removal.
    Multicolinearity was examined through Spearman's rank correlation analysis. In the first model,
    only the sociodemographic variables were included. In the second model, health-related variables
    were entered in a second block. Similarly, in the third and fourth models, the second block
    consisted of the behavioral and personality, and the COVID-19 related perceptions variables,
    respectively. P values were not corrected, a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

    Rate of APM
    Individual mean scores of APM were calculated. Based on the shape of the histogram (see
    Supplementary materials), a mean score < 4 was considered as non-adherence. A significant
    minority of the participants (38.1%) reported a mean level < 4 and was consequently defined as
    non-adherent.

    Spearman's correlation coefficients were examined for all independent variables. All correlations
    were < 0.7. The correlations among age, marital status, and having children were in the 0.53-0.69
    range.
    Table 2 presents the unadjusted and adjusted regression analysis results for non-APM. The
    following variables were found to predict non-APM after adjustment for sociodemographic
    variables.

    Sociodemographic variables: The following variables predicted non-APM on adjusted analyses:
    male gender, younger age (<=64), and being single. Being employed predicted more non-APM;
    conversely, decrease in income predicted more adherence.
    Health-related variables: Less regular physical activity and higher levels of ADHD symptoms and
    of psychological distress predicted non-APM.
    Behavioral and personality factors: High levels of past risk-taking behavior and anti-social
    behavior, as well as low levels of pro-sociality, predicted non-APM.
    COVID-19 perception variables: Non-APM was predicted by higher perceived non-adherence
    norms, lower perceived risk of COVID-19, lower perceived efficacy of the preventive measures, as
    well as higher perceived costs of adherence.
    Discussion
    This study aimed to identify risk factors for non-APM during the chronic phase of the COVID-19
    outbreak. Several factors were found to predict non-adherence. Sociodemographic factors included
    male gender, young age, bachelorhood, being employed, and smaller decrease in income. Health-
    related factors included physical activity, psychological distress, and ADHD symptoms. Behavioral
    and personality factors included history of risk-taking and anti-social behavior, and low pro-
    sociality. Finally, COVID-19 perception factors included perceived social norms favoring non-
    adherence, low perceived risk of COVID-19, lower perceived efficacy of the preventive measures,
    and higher perceived costs of adherence to the preventive measures. Notably, the greatest predictors
    in terms of OR were lower age, past anti-social behavior, low perceived risk of COVID-19, the
    efficacy of the preventive measures, and the norms of adhering to the preventive measures.
    The variables that predicted non-APM at the chronic phase of the outbreak in Israel were similar to
    those that predicted non-APM during the first wave in Israel (5), suggesting that similar motivations
    drive the decision whether to adhere to preventive measures or not. Many of the non-APM
    predictors that were found in this study have also been reported by studies conducted in other states.
    For instance, male gender and young age were linked to non-adherence in the US, Somalia, Saudi
    Arabia, and Hong Kong during the COVID-19 outbreak (3, 4, 7, 24, 25). The negative correlation
    between employment and adherence in the current study parallels the findings of Porten et al.
    during the SARS outbreak in Germany (26). Several studies highlighted the association between
                                                                        12

    adherence and perceptions about the infection and the preventive measures in a variety of states
    during the current pandemic (27-29). The negative correlation between adherence and the perceived
    costs of adherence resembles the findings of DiGiovanni et al. (30) reporting that perceived
    economic costs of the quarantine in Canada during the 2004 SARS outbreak were related to non-
    adherence. The role of social norms has been demonstrated in a study concerning quarantine in
    Senegal during Ebola outbreak (31) and in Australia during H1N1 outbreak (32). The negative
    correlation between adherence and past risk-taking behavior and unhealthy lifestyle is in line with a
    study reporting that among young adults with hazardous drinking, adherence to public policies is
    suboptimal (33). Our study adds new predictors of non-adherence including ADHD symptoms,
    general risk-taking behavior, previous engagement in crime, as well as low pro-sociality, which
    contributed for better prediction of non-APM.
    Many of the above listed factors have been shown to predict non-adherence to medical treatment
    (8), risk-taking behavior (9, 10), and anti-social behavior (11). Accordingly, adherence to
    preventive measures may be analyzed in all the corresponding theoretical frameworks.
    Notably, having medical risk factors for COVID-19 (i.e., background diseases) did not predict
    higher adherence to preventive measures. A similar independency between objective risk and
    adherence was found in a study reporting no effect of the total probable cases of SARS on
    likelihood of adherence (34).
    Public Health Implications
    In deriving implication for public health, it is important to differentiate between predictors that
    preceded the COVID-19 outbreak, and therefore can be considered risk factors for non-APM, and
    other variables that coincided with the outbreak and hence their causal relations with non-APM
    cannot be determined based on a cross-sectional study. The latter include the economic
    consequence of COVID-19, as well as the perceptions regarding the pandemic and the preventive
    measures. Nevertheless, these coinciding predictors may still be used for targeting populations at-
    risk to non-APM.
    The current findings of observable risk factors for non-APM suggest that the nature and the
    communication of the preventive measures should be targeted for different people. Policymakers
    may develop specific plans for populations at risk of non-adherence, focusing on messaging,
    fostering, and enforcing preventive measures, as well as on increased monitoring of infection rate.

    Further research is warranted for identifying other risk factors for non-APM across longer periods
    and changing contexts and for examining the efficacy of public health policy in promoting APM.
