  B. Design Parameters
    This section describes the design concept of the model.
  1)        Basic Principle: The basic principle of the model is to
understand the effect of social distancing on COVID-19 spread.
We would use two types of strategies to understand this effect.
  2)        Emergence: By employing the simple rule of social
distancing, we found the emergent structure of healthy and sick
people in society.
  3)        Adaption: People would adapt to the optimal strategy
to remain healthy.
  4)        Objectives: The people's objective is to remain
healthy, and also maintain their relationships.
  5)        Learning: The agent would learn how to survive by                   Table 1: The experiment factors and levels
following the social distancing rule.
  6)        Prediction: Overall death and survival rates.                          2) Input Data: There is no input data in this model.
  7)        Sensing: gents would sense the other agents who are                    3) Sub Models:

  8)        Interaction: Every agent would interact with other
agents randomly.
  9)        Stochasticity: Agent moves randomly in the canvas.
  10)       Collectives: There are no collectives in the model.                      𝑃𝑖                    𝑃recovered=𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒) /𝑃𝑡            (1)

distancing prove that the numbers of infected and deaths were
reduced compared to the previous experiment. The number of
infected people was 997 in the first experiment, but in the
second experiment, it became 708 infected cases. Therefore, the
decline in infected numbers of people in the second experiment
lead to a decrease in the number of deaths too.
 C. Social Distancing 40%
 Then, the percentage of social distancing was increased to the
next level, which is higher and equal to 40%, resulting in further
improvement and reduction in the spread of disease compared
to the lower previous levels of social distancing, as shown in

 Figure 19: Effect of social distancing on infection rate
 As we presented previously, the previous six experiments
have visual outputs. However, there are ten other
experiments done with ten different levels of social
distancing by using the behavior space tool, and their results
are shown in figure 19. The curve proved and confirmed
that increasing the social distancing percentage leads to a
lower infection rate, which results in decreasing the deaths
and recovery rates.                                                            Figure 22: Survival rate
