    Abstract
    We measured SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in serum samples from 1,471 mother/newborn
    dyads and found efficient transplacental transfer of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 72 of 83
    seropositive pregnant women. Transfer ratios >1.0 were observed among women with an
    asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as those with mild, moderate and severe COVID-
    19. Our findings demonstrate the potential for maternally-derived antibodies to provide neonatal
    protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    Main
    Newborn protection from infection is primarily dependent upon neonatal innate immune
    responses and maternally-derived, transplacentally-acquired antibodies. The extent to which
    maternal antibodies produced in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
    (SARS-CoV-2) infection during pregnancy cross the placenta is important for understanding
    potential neonatal protection from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and for developing
    appropriate maternal vaccination strategies when effective vaccines become available. To date,
    studies of transplacental transfer of maternal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies to newborns are
    limited to case reports and small case series of women with symptomatic infection.1–3
    To assess the relationship between maternal and neonatal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody
    levels, we utilized sera and paired cord blood collected from women presenting for delivery from
    April 9, 2020 to August 8, 2020 at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We
    collected samples that were otherwise to be discarded and measured maternal and neonatal
    SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to the spike
    receptor binding domain (RBD) antigen using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
    with ~1% false-positive rate.4 A cutoff at 0.48 arbitrary units was used to define IgG and IgM
    seropositivity, as previously described.4
    There were 1,714 women who delivered during the study period, including 31 women with twin
    deliveries. Matched maternal-cord blood sera were available for 1,471 mother/newborn dyads
    (Supplemental Figure 1). Of the 1,471 matched dyads, 83 women (5.6%) were SARS-CoV-2
    seropositive and 1,388 women (94.4%) were seronegative. Among infants delivered to
    seropositive women, 72 infants (87%) were seropositive and 11 (13%) were seronegative.
    There were no seropositive infants born to the 1,388 seronegative women. During the study
    period, pregnant women were routinely screened for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal PCR

    (NP-PCR) when admitted to the hospital for delivery, and/or tested during pregnancy due to
    SARS-CoV-2 exposures or COVID-19 symptoms. All seropositive women were NP-PCR tested
    (with the exception of one woman who declined screening on admission for delivery); 44/82
    (54%) seropositive women were PCR-positive at some point during pregnancy (Table 1). Most
    women (50/83) were asymptomatic for COVID-19. Newborns (20/83) were tested for SARS-
    CoV-2 by NP-PCR between 24-48 hours after birth if the mother was NP-PCR positive and met
    clinical criteria for being contagious at the time of delivery; none were positive.
    There was a positive correlation between SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels in cord and maternal sera
    (Pearson’s r2=0.7852, P<0.001; Figure 1A). SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies were not detectable in
    any of the 72 seropositive infants (Figure 1B). We compared the quantitative levels of maternal
    IgG among the 11 seronegative infants versus seropositive infants. In 5 cases, the mother was
    seropositive only by IgM (without IgG above cutoff level) and the cord sera were seronegative.
    In the remaining 6 seronegative infants, geometric mean IgG levels were significantly lower in
    the mothers of the seronegative infants compared to the 72 women with seropositive infants
    (1.27 vs 5.22 arbitrary units, P=0.005) (Supplemental Table 1). We assessed the relationship
    between severity of maternal infection, maternal IgG level and cord IgG level (Table 1). Women
    with moderate or critical illness trended to higher IgG and IgM levels, and infants born to these
    women trended to higher cord IgG levels, but these differences in antibody levels were not
    statistically significant.
    We determined the transplacental antibody transfer ratio, calculated as infant IgG level divided
    by maternal IgG level. Transfer ratio was not different among cord sera from infants born to
    mothers according to level of illness (Table 1). In contrast to asymptomatic women whose onset
    of exposure or infection cannot be reliably determined, the timing of symptom-prompted viral
    testing can be used as a surrogate for onset of infection. Therefore, we assessed the

    relationship between transfer ratio and onset of maternal infection among a subset of 26 women
    with mild, moderate or critical illness, who had a positive NP-PCR test prior to delivery and who
    delivered at term gestation. We observed a positive correlation between transfer ratio and
    increasing time between NP-PCR testing and delivery (Pearson’s r2=0.3845, P<0.001; Figure
    1C). We further explored the impact of maternal, fetal and newborn characteristics on
    categorical cord serostatus among all seropositive mothers (n=83) and categorical transfer ratio
    among IgG seropositive mothers (n=78). We found no association with maternal demographic
    and pregnancy health characteristics and cord seropositive status (Supplemental Table 1).
    Transfer ratio was not different comparing preterm (<37 weeks’ gestation) versus term (≥37
    weeks’ gestation) deliveries, with the earliest delivery at 31 weeks’ gestation (Supplemental
    Table 2).
    Determination of correlates of maternal and neonatal immunity is a high priority area for SARS-
    CoV-2 research in the pregnancy and newborn health domains.5 Although placental and
    neonatal SARS-CoV-2 transmission have been reported1–3,6–8, current evidence suggests that
    this event is not common.9,10 Two case reports from China describing detectable neonatal IgM
    soon after birth could represent true vertical transmission of disease, or could represent false-
    positive IgM testing.2,3 We did not detect IgM antibodies in any cord blood sera samples even in
    cases of critical maternal illness or preterm delivery, supporting that maternal-fetal SARS-CoV-2
    transmission is rare. Of greater concern is the potential for newborns to be infected postnatally
    from contagious mothers or other household contacts. We found efficient transplacental transfer
    of IgG antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 seropositive pregnant women, with transfer ratios that
    could exceed 2 in this study where ~90% of women delivered at term gestation. We found that
    higher maternal antibody levels were associated with higher cord antibody levels. Furthermore,
    a longer duration between onset of maternal infection and time of delivery led to higher maternal
    antibody levels and higher transfer ratios. These findings are aligned with prior studies of

    transplacental antibody transfer, although other factors – such as the antigen-elicited IgG
    subclass, maternal infections during pregnancy, chronic maternal immunodeficiency, placental
    pathology and gestational age at birth – are known to impact transfer efficiency. 11,12
    Strengths of our study include a large cohort with access to available discarded specimens,
    allowing a focus on all women presenting for delivery over the study period, as opposed to
    studies targeting women with clinical infection identified during pregnancy or at the time of
    delivery. Study limitations include the small numbers of samples from preterm births, and the
    use of discarded specimens with retrospective data collection that does not provide information
    on post-discharge outcomes.
    It is notable that the majority of seropositive women were asymptomatic, within uncertain timing
    of viral exposure. Among the subset of women in our study whose onset of infection could be
    estimated by symptoms prompting viral NP-PCR testing, all cord sera were seropositive if the
    time between maternal NP-PCR testing was at least 17 days prior to delivery. Further studies
    are needed to determine if SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are protective from newborn infection; if so,
    at what level; and whether the transplacental kinetics of vaccine-elicited antibodies are similar to
    naturally-acquired antibodies. Our findings demonstrate the potential for maternally-derived
    antibodies to provide neonatal protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and will help inform both
    neonatal management guidance as well as the design of vaccine trials during pregnancy.

    Methods
    Serum sample collection and clinical data
    We utilized discarded maternal serum samples and discarded neonatal cord blood sera
    collected during the birth hospital admission. Pregnant women at Pennsylvania Hospital have
    blood drawn for rapid plasma reagin at the time of delivery as routine syphilis screening and
    newborns routinely have cord blood stored if blood type or Coombs testing is clinically needed;
    residual maternal and cord blood serum from this testing was obtained when it would otherwise
    be discarded. Demographic and clinical data, including information on additional SARS-CoV-2
    testing prior to delivery, were collected from review of electronic medical records. Race and
    ethnicity were self-reported. International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10)
    diagnosis codes O24, E08-E13, and Z79.4 were used to capture type 1 diabetes, type 2
    diabetes, and gestational diabetes, and codes O10, O11, O13-O16, I10-I13, and I15 were used
    to capture hypertensive disorders, gestational hypertension, and pre-eclampsia. The accuracy
    of using these codes has been validated with medical chart review 4. Only the first twin from
    each pair as included in all analyses.
    Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
    Samples were tested in ELISA using plates coated with recombinant receptor binding domain
    (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This assay has been validated using samples from
    COVID-19 recovered donors and samples collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, as
    previously described.4 The RBD protein was produced in 293F cells using plasmid provided by
    F. Krammer (Mt. Sinai) and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). Coated ELISA
    plates (Immulon 4 HBX, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were stored overnight at 4C. The next day,
    plates were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T)
    followed by blocking for 1 hour with PBS-T supplemented with 3% non-fat milk powder. Heat-
    inactivated serum samples were diluted in PBS-T supplemented with 1% non-fat milk powder

    and 50 L diluted serum sample was added to each well after washing the plates 3 times with
    PBS-T. After 2 hours incubation at room temperature using a plate mixer, plates were washed
    again 3 times with PBS-T and 50 L of 1:5000 diluted horseradish peroxidase labeled goat anti-
    human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or 1:1000 diluted goat anti-human IgM-
    horseradish peroxidase (SouthernBiotech) secondary antibodies were added. Plates were
    incubated for 1 hour at room temperature using a plate mixer, followed by another triple wash
    with PBS-T. Next, 50 L SureBlue 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (KPL) was added to
    each well and plates were incubated for 5 minutes before 25 L of 250 mM hydrochloric acid
    was added to each well to stop the reaction. Plates were read with the SpectraMax 190
    microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at an optical density (OD) of 450 nm. All samples were
    also tested on plates coated with PBS only to obtain background OD values, which were
    subtracted from the OD values from plates coated with RBD. Monoclonal antibody CR3022 was
    included on each plate to adjust for plate-to-plate variation and antibody concentrations were
    expressed in arbitrary units relative to CR3022. Plasmids to express CR3022 were provided by
    I. Wilson (Scripps). All samples were first tested in duplicate at a 1:50 dilution. Samples with an
    IgG and/or IgM concentration above the lower limit of detection (0.20 arbitrary units) were
    repeated in at least a 7-point dilution series to obtain quantitative results. Samples with IgG
    and/or IgM levels >0.48 arbitrary units were considered seropositive. Samples with IgG and/or
    IgM levels below this cutoff were assigned a value of 0.24 arbitrary units for all analyses. We
    previously reported IgG levels for a maternal seroprevalence study which included 25 of the 83
    seropositive women in the current report.4

    Statistical methods
    Antibody levels were log2-transformed for all statistical analyses. Geometric mean antibody
    levels with 95% confidence intervals were reported if not stated otherwise. The correlation
    between log2-transformed maternal and neonatal IgG levels as well as the correlation between
    transfer ratio and days between NP test and delivery were reported using Pearson’s correlation
    coefficient. Standard descriptive analyses using Fisher’s exact test, unpaired t test, analysis of
    variance (ANOVA), Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate, compared the
    demographics, clinical characteristics, timing and reason for maternal NP-PCR testing, and
    maternal and infant antibody levels and transfer ratios between the comparison groups.
    Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata
    version 16 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) and Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software).

Footnotes: 1Maternal illness severity was defined as: (a) Asymptomatic – No history of COVID-19 symptoms at time of delivery or on
review of prenatal history, (b) Mild disease – Symptoms that do not include shortness of breath or radiographic evidence of
pneumonia, with normal oxygenation, (c) Moderate to critical disease – Symptoms that include shortness of breath or radiographic
evidence of pneumonia, with or without administration of supplemental oxygenation, non-invasive respiratory support or mechanical
ventilation. 2Mild disease in 21/25 cases was defined by symptoms reported in conjunction with NP-PCR testing. In the remaining 4
cases, women reported COVID-19 consistent symptoms (including anosmia in 2/4 cases) to obstetric caregivers, 39-124 days prior

                                                                                                                                      16
to delivery, and sought testing, but obstetrician or midwife unable to test patient. In each case, routine NP-PCR screening at the time
of admission to labor floor was negative. 3One asymptomatic woman declined routine admission NP-PCR screening. 4One tested as
required of her employment; two tested due to a COVID-positive contact. 5Only values >0.48 arbitrary units included in the
calculation of geometric mean. 6Only includes infants born to IgG seropositive mothers (maternal IgG >0.48 arbitrary units). 76 out of
78 infants born to IgG seropositive mothers were seronegative (cord IgG ≤0.48 arbitrary units); set cord IgG level at 0.24 for these 6
infants. CI, confidence interval; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; GA, gestational age; IgG, immunoglobulin G; IgM,

    Figure 1: Correlation between maternal and neonatal cord sera SARS-CoV-2-specific
    antibody levels.
    Legend: (A-B) Correlation between IgG levels (A) and IgM levels (B) in sera from seropositive
    women and matched cord blood from seropositive (n=72, grey data points) and seronegative
    (n=11, open circle data points) infants. IgG levels in cord blood positively correlate with maternal
    IgG levels (r2=0.7852, P<0.001 using Pearson’s correlation with log 2 transformed IgG levels).
    None of the infants born to seropositive mothers had detectable IgM levels. Dashed lines
    indicate 0.48 arbitrary units, which was the cutoff used to distinguish positive versus negative
    samples. Samples that were below this cutoff were assigned an antibody level of 0.24 arbitrary
    units. (C) Effect of days from NP test to delivery on transplacental antibody transfer. Transfer
    ratio of IgG antibodies from mother to infant (n=26 matched mother-infant dyads) is positively
    correlated with days from NP test to delivery (r2=0.3845, P<0.001 using Pearson’s correlation).

Footnotes: 1Transfer ratio calculated as (cord IgG level)/(maternal IgG level). 2After excluding the 6 infants with no transfer, there
was a significant difference between the transfer ratio categories for geometric mean maternal IgM level (P=0.01) and number of NP-
PCR positive women (P=0.04); all other characteristics were not significantly different (P≥0.05) between the transfer ratio categories.
CI, confidence interval; GA, gestational age; IgG, immunoglobulin G; IgM, immunoglobulin M; NP-PCR, nasopharyngeal polymerase
chain reaction; IQR, interquartile range.
