43     Abstract
44     Introduction
45     As the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has become increasingly politicized in the United
46     States (US), political party affiliation of state leaders may contribute to policies affecting the
47     spread of the disease. We examined differences in COVID-19 infection and death rates stratified
48     by governor party affiliation across the 50 US states and the District of Columbia (DC).
49
50     Methods
51     We conducted a longitudinal analysis examining daily COVID-19 incidence and death rates from
52     March 1 to September 30, 2020, for each US state and DC. We fit a Bayesian negative binomial
53     model to estimate adjusted daily risk ratios (RRs) and posterior intervals (PIs) comparing
54     infection and death rates by gubernatorial (mayoral for DC) party affiliation. We adjusted for
55     several state-level variables, including population density, age, race, poverty, and health.
56
57     Results
58     From March to early June 2020, Republican-led states had, on average, lower COVID-19
59     incidence rates compared to Democratic-led states. However, on June 8, the association
60     reversed, and Republican-led states had higher per capita COVID-19 incidence rates (RR=1.15,
61     95% PI: 1.02, 1.25). This trend persisted until September 30 (RR=1.26, 95% PI: 0.96, 1.51).
62     For death rates, Republican-led states had lower average rates early in the pandemic, but higher
63     rates from July 13 (RR=1.22, 95% PI: 1.03,1.37) to September 30 (RR=1.74, 95% PI: 1.20,
64     2.24).

66     Conclusion
67     Gubernatorial party affiliation may drive policy decisions that impact COVID-19 infections and
68     deaths across the US. As attitudes toward the pandemic become increasingly polarized, policy
69     decisions should be guided by public health considerations rather than political ideology.

71     Introduction
72     Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a global public health crisis. As of
73     October 3, 2020, there have been over 7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 2 million
74     related deaths in the US.1 In response to the pandemic, the governors of all 50 states declared
75     states of emergency. Shortly thereafter, states began enacting policies to help stop the spread of
76     the virus. However, these policies vary and are guided, in part, by decisions from state
77     governors.
78
79     Under the 10th Amendment to the US Constitution, which gives states all powers not specifically
80     apportioned to the federal government, state governors have the authority to take action in public
81     health emergencies. For example, earlier this year, nearly all state governors issued stay-at-home
82     executive orders that advised or required residents to shelter in place.2 Two recent studies found
83     that Republican governors, however, were slower to adopt stay-at-home orders, if they did so at
84     all.3,4 Moreover, another study found that Democratic governors had longer durations of stay-at-
85     home orders.5 Further, researchers identified governor Democratic political party affiliation as
86     the most important predictor of state mandates to wear face masks.6
87
88     Although recent studies have examined individual state policies, such as mandates to socially
89     distance, wear masks, and close schools and parks,3,4,6-8 multiple policies may act in unison to
90     impact the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, the pandemic response has become increasingly
91     politicized.7,9,10 As such, political affiliation of state leaders, and specifically governors, might
92     best capture the omnibus impact of state policies. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to
                                                                          5

 93     examine differences in incidence and death rate trends over time, stratified by governors’
 94     political affiliation among the 50 states and DC.
 95
 96     Methods
 97     We conducted a longitudinal analysis examining COVID-19 incidence and death rates from
 98     March 1 to September 30, 2020 for the 50 states and DC. Based on prior research,3,4,6,7 we
 99     hypothesized that states with Republican governors would have lower incidence and death rates
100     early in the pandemic as many Democratic governors preside over international hubs that served
101     as points of entry for the virus in early 2020.11,12 We also hypothesized that Republican-led
102     states would have higher rates in later months, potentially reflecting policy differences that break
103     along party lines. The Institutional Review Boards at the Medical University of South Carolina
104     and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health deemed this research exempt.
105
106     We documented governor party affiliation for each US state; for DC, we used mayoral
107     affiliation. We obtained daily COVID-19 incident case and death data from USAFacts,13 a well-
108     validated source of COVID-19 tracking information, for each county in the US.14,15 We
109     aggregated county data to obtain state-level data. We then adjusted for potential confounders
110     chosen a priori from the US Census Bureau and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.16-18
111     These included state population size to compute population density, the percentage of state
112     residents aged 65 and older, the percentage of Black and Hispanic residents, the percentage
113     below the federal poverty line, the percentage in poor or fair health, and the number of primary
114     care physicians per 100,000 residents.

116     Statistical analysis
117     We fit Bayesian negative binomial models with daily incident cases and deaths for each state as
118     the outcomes. The models included penalized cubic Bsplines for both the fixed and random
119     (state-specific) temporal effects. We included state population as an offset on the log scale. We
120     assigned ridging priors to the spline coefficients.19 We standardized adjustment variables and
121     assigned diffuse normal priors to their coefficients. We assigned a gamma prior to the dispersion
122     parameter. For posterior computation, we developed an efficient Gibbs sampler20,21 and ran the
123     algorithm for 50,000 iterations with a burn-in 10,000 to ensure convergence. Sensitivity
124     analyses demonstrated the model’s robustness to prior specification.
125
126     We stratified states by governors’ affiliation and graphed the posterior mean incidence and death
127     rates daily for the reference covariate group, as well as the 95% posterior intervals (PIs). We
128     reported adjusted risk ratios (RRs) and 95% PIs comparing states, with RRs > 1.00 indicating
129     higher rates among Republican-led states. We conducted analyses using R software version 3.6
130     (R Core Team, 2019).
131
132     Results
133     The final sample comprised 10,914 observations (51 states x 214 study days) with 26
134     Republican-led and 25 Democratic-led states. Figures 1(a) and 1(b) present incidence trends (in
135     cases per 100,000) and adjusted RRs by gubernatorial affiliation. Republican-led states had
136     lower rates from March to early June 2020. However, on June 8, the association reversed
137     (RR=1.15, 95% PI: 1.02, 1.25), indicating that Republican-led states had on average 1.15 times
138     more cases per 100,000 than Democratic-led states. The RRs increased steadily thereafter,
                                                                           7

140     positive through September 29 (RR=1.31, 95% PI: 1.06, 1.52). However, on September 30, risk
141     ratio overlapped the null (RR=1.26, 95% PI: 0.96, 1.51).

147     We observed a similar pattern for the death trends shown in Figures 2(a) and 2(b). Republican-

149     July 13 (RR=1.22, 95% PI: 1.03,1.37). The estimated RRs increased sharply through July 25

159     Discussion
160     In this longitudinal analysis, we found that Republican-led states had fewer per capita COVID-
161     19 cases and deaths early in the pandemic, but these trends reversed in early June (for cases) and
162     in July (for deaths). These early trends could be explained by high COVID-19 rates among
163     Democratic-led states that are home to initial ports of entry for the virus in early 2020.11,12
164     However, the subsequent reversal in trends to Republican-led states may reflect policy
165     differences that could have facilitated the spread of the virus.3,4,6-9
166
167     For instance, Adolph et al. found that Republican governors were slower to adopt both stay-at-
168     home orders and mandates to wear face masks.3,6 Other studies have shown that Democratic
169     governors were more likely to issue stay-at-home orders with longer durations.4,5 Moreover,
170     decisions by Republican governors in spring 2020 to retract policies, such as the lifting of stay-
                                                                           9

                                                                                                                                         10
171     at-home orders on April 28 in Georgia,22 may have contributed to increased cases and deaths.
172     Thus, governors’ political affiliation might function as an upstream progenitor of multifaceted
173     policies that, in unison, impact the spread of the virus. Although there were notable exceptions
174     among Republican governors in states such as Maryland, Ohio, and Massachusetts, Republican
175     governors were by and large less likely than their Democratic counterparts to enact policies
176     aligned with public health social distancing recommendations.3
177
178     There are, however, limitations to this study. We conducted a population-level rather than
179     individual-level analysis. Although we controlled for potential confounders (e.g., population
180     density), the findings could reflect the virus’s spread from urban to rural areas.11,12 Additionally,
181     as with any observational study, we cannot infer causality. Finally, governors are not the only
182     authoritative actor in a state. Future research could explore associations between party affiliation
183     of state or local legislatures, particularly when these differ from governors.

185     Our findings suggest that governor political party affiliation may differentially impact COVID-
186     19 incidence and death rates. As attitudes toward the pandemic become increasingly
187     polarized,7,9,10 policy decisions should be guided by public health considerations rather than
188     political expedience,23 as the latter may lead to increases COVID-19 cases and deaths.
