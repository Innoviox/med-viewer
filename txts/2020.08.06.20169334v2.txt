Abstract
Introduction
NHS ambulance service conveyance rates in the UK are almost 70%, despite an increase in non-emergency cases. This is
increasing the demands on crowded emergency departments (ED) and contributes to increased ambulance turnaround
times. Yorkshire Ambulance Service introduced a specialist paramedic (SP) role to try and address this, but non-conveyance
rates in this group have not been as high as expected.
Methods
We conducted a controlled interrupted time series analysis of appropriate non-conveyance rates in the 12 months before
and after an SP primary care placement, using matched groups of patients cared for by SPs and control paramedics. A
costing analysis examined the average cost per appropriate non-conveyance and the cost-eﬀectiveness ratio between
groups.
Results
Between June 2017 and December 2019 there were 7349 incidents attended by intervention group SPs and eligible
for inclusion. Following removal of cases with missing data, 5537/7349 (75.3%) cases remained. Post-placement, the
intervention group demonstrated an increase in appropriate non-conveyance rate by 32.2% (95%CI 20.1–44.3%, p<0.001)
and a reduction in the trend of appropriate non-conveyance relative to the control group of -1.8% (95%CI -3.5—0.0%,
p=0.045).
Post-placement, the cost per appropriate non-conveyance for intervention paramedics was a mean of £501.94 (95%
bootstrapped CI £477.99–£526.46) versus £1217.89 (95% bootstrapped CI £1121.49–£1321.85) for the control group. This
represents a mean saving of £715.95 per appropriate non-conveyance (95% bootstrapped CI £638.23–£795.69) for SPs
compared to the control group, and a cost-eﬀectiveness ratio of £2226.04 per percentage increase in appropriate non-
conveyance (95% bootstrapped CI £1854.11–£2748.44).
Conclusion
In this single UK NHS ambulance service study, we found a clinically important and statistically signiﬁcant increase in ap-
propriate   non-conveyance rates by specialist paramedics who had completed a 10-week GP placement. This improvement

Introduction
The National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom is facing a 5% year-on-year increase in demand for urgent and
emergency care services [1]. In 2018/19, ambulance services in England provided a face-to-face assessment to nearly
7.9 million incidents, of which 5.4 million were conveyed to hospital [2]. This non-conveyance rate of nearly 70% is
occurring despite an increase in non-emergency cases and continues to place increasing demands on already crowded
emergency departments (EDs), leading to decreased availability of ambulances as turnaround times at hospitals increase
[3]. ED overcrowding is a signiﬁcant issue for patients, resulting in poorer quality of care, increased healthcare costs and
potentially, increased mortality [4–7].
Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust (YAS) have been early adopters of initiatives to respond appropriately to the
increase in non-emergency cases, with the introduction of advanced paramedics working in the role of Emergency Care
Practitioners (ECP) since 2004 [8]. Even without selective dispatching, ECPs consistently have non-conveyance rates
double that of other paramedics in the Trust. Since 2015, the specialist paramedic (SP) role has been introduced in YAS,
with education comprising of a 1 year university program. However, during the time period of this study (2017–2019), YAS
SP non-conveyance rates were around 37.5%, compared to the overall non-conveyance rate of 30%. In contrast, ECPs had
non-conveyance rates of over 59% for all call categories.
In 2018, Health Education England (HEE) funded a pilot scheme to rotate paramedics into a range of healthcare settings,
with the aim of improving patient care and relieving pressures on primary care, ambulance services and other parts of the
NHS in a sustainable way [9]. A subsequent economic evaluation estimated that the rotating paramedics could save in
the region of £275,000 per year in avoidable conveyance and subsequent admission to hospital compared to historic
controls. However, data from Yorkshire included 5 ECPs who participated in the pilot and the analysis did not adjust for
the diﬀerence in patient acuity between the pre- and post-placement phases [10].
The HEE pilot also presented an opportunity to further develop the decision-making of SPs, with the potential to deliver
patient and cost-beneﬁts that were anticipated when the role was created. This study aimed to evaluate whether a
primary care placement appropriately increases the level and trend of non-conveyance decisions made by SPs compared
to a matched control population of YAS paramedics in a cost-eﬀective manner.
Objectives
The primary objective was to determine the change and trend in proportion of appropriate non-conveyance decisions by
specialist paramedics who have completed a 10-week placement in a General Practitioner (GP) practice. The secondary
objective was to compare the cost-eﬀectiveness of specialist paramedics who have completed a 10-week placement in a
GP practice compared to a matched control group of YAS paramedics.
Methods
This study was a natural experiment using routinely collected observational data. We utilised a controlled interrupted
time series (CITS) analysis method to detect any change in the level and trend of appropriate non-conveyance decisions
by SPs and paramedics. The cost-eﬀectiveness analysis examined the cost per appropriate non-conveyance achieved
for patients receiving care from SPs who have completed a 10 week placement in a GP practice compared with those
receiving usual care from paramedics and SPs who did not undertake the 10 week placement. In addition, we calculated
the cost-eﬀectiveness ratio to determine the diﬀerence in cost between groups per percent increase in appropriate
non-conveyance.
National reporting of non-conveyance rates describe the proportion of patients who call 999 and are not transported to
ED. If a resource e.g. ambulance is not sent to scene, this call is classed as a ‘hear and treat’ call. However, if an ambulance
is sent to scene but the patient is not subsequently transported to hospital, this is classed as a ‘see and treat’ call. SPs
participating in the YAS HEE pilot, did not have the opportunity to undertake ‘hear and treat’ calls and so non-conveyance
for the purpose of this study, refers only to ‘see and treat’ calls.
Setting
YAS provides 24-hour emergency and health care services for the county of Yorkshire in the north of England. The county
has a population of approximately ﬁve million, spread over almost 6000 square miles of varied terrain, included isolated
moors and dales, coastline and heavily populated urban areas. In 2018/19 YAS received more than 998,500 emergency
calls and responded to 798,968 incidents by either sending clinicians to scene or by providing assessment and advice over
the telephone.

Specialist paramedic rotation
YAS employs approximately 118 SPs and 33 ECPs. In the Leeds area, 5 ECPs and 10 SPs worked with a number of primary
care organisations. The ECPs and SPs rotated between providing a home visiting service for 15 GP surgeries for 10 weeks,
followed by front line operations, either responding to 999 calls or working in the emergency operations centre (EOC)
staﬃng a dedicated dispatch desk for SPs.
Data sources
We used routinely collected computer aided dispatch (CAD) and patient record data to identify all cases attended by the
10 SPs who had completed a GP placement in the Leeds area. For operational reasons, these placements were staggered,
with the ﬁrst paramedics entering the rotation in June 2018 and the ﬁnal paramedics completing their placements at the
end of December 2018. In order to obtain suﬃcient data pre- and post-pilot, all cases attended by these paramedics in the
12 month period prior to the placement commencing and 12 months after the placement had completed were obtained.
To count as an ‘attendance’, the SPs name had to appear on the patient record.
To take account of case-mix and paramedic experience in the pre- and post-placement phase, a matched comparison
(control) group consisting of cases in Yorkshire covering the period from the 1st June, 2017 to 31st December, 2019 was
obtained. This cohort of patients received a face-to-face assessment by paramedics and SPs who did not take part in the
GP rotation.
Since YAS does not keep a record of paramedic registration beyond the current 2-year registration cycle, it was not possible
to determine how long staﬀ had been registered as a paramedic using data from the Service. Instead, we identiﬁed when
staﬀ were ﬁrst entered into the Health and Professions Council (HCPC) paramedic register.
Study variables
We hypothesised that appropriate non-conveyance was likely to increase following the 10-week placement, but needed
to ensure that we took account of factors previously identiﬁed as being important when pre-hospital clinicians make
non-conveyance decisions [11]. To achieve this, we aimed to match the control and intervention groups on the following
variables:
     • Patient:
           – Age (5 year increments)
           – Sex
           – Working impression (as determined by paramedic on scene)
           – Time of call (in-hours/out-of-hours)
           – Call category
           – Call month and year
           – Lowest National Early Warning Score (NEWS) threshold
     • Location (lower super output area, LSOA):
           – Urban/rural
           – Index of multiple deprivation decile
           – Proportion of population within LSOA with a long-term physical or mental illness (0–4%, 4–8%, 8–12%)
     • Paramedics
           – Years registered as a paramedic (<1 year, 1–5 years, >5 years)
           – Role designation at time of incident.
Since the ambulance service does not routinely capture outcome data for all patients, we pragmatically deﬁned appropriate
non-conveyance as any patient episode where the patient was not transferred to hospital and no further calls were made
to the ambulance service in the following 72 hours.
Matching
Matching was performed utilising a genetic algorithm and computed using the R statistics package ‘Matching’ [12].
Genetic algorithms are a subgroup of evolutionary computing which as the name suggests, imitate biological processes
of reproduction and natural selection to solve according to ‘ﬁtness’ [13]. The ‘Matching’ package uses this algorithm to
ﬁnd the optimal balance between groups by examining the cumulative probability distribution functions of a variety of
standardised statistics such as t-tests and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.
Cases where the patient record could not be located or where data was missing were excluded. With the exception of ECPs
(who were removed since their non-conveyance rates are consistently higher than other clinicians), it was not possible to
accurately determine what role designation paramedics in the control group had. As a result, this had to be removed as a
matching variable.

Statistical methods
Sample size calculation
The sample size was constrained by the fact that this was an observational study with only 12 months pre- and post-
placement available. Based on a previous audit of 999 call data, we anticipated that there would be approximately 700
patient episodes per month. Given that the time series analysis covered a 24 month time period in total, it was anticipated
that approximately 33,600 incidents would be included in the dataset.
Summary of baseline data
Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the data pre- and post-placement and between intervention group SPs and
the control group, to illustrate the success of matching. Median and interquartile ranges were reported for continuous
variables, and counts and proportions reported for categorical data.
Primary outcome analysis
We conducted a retrospective analysis of appropriate non-conveyance before and after the GP placement, using segmented
regression as part of a CITS design [14]. Since the SP placements were staggered, the actual month and year was not
utilised. Instead, the number of months before and after the placement were used, so that month 1 was the month
that occurred 12 months prior to the GP placement for all SPs and month 24, the month that occurred 12 months after
the placement. It was anticipated that this would remove or reduce any autocorrelation. However, we checked for
auto-regression and moving averages by performing the Durbin-Watson test and by plotting autocorrelation function and
partial autocorrelation function plots. Coeﬃcients from the model were used to predict the absolute change and trend in
appropriate non-conveyance following the GP placement.
Secondary outcome analysis
Salary costs were calculated for the 10 week GP placement and divided by the number of incidents attended by SPs to
calculate a per-incident cost. SPs were assumed to be salaried at NHS Agenda for Change mid-band 6, which was £31,121
for 2018/19. Education costs were not included since all SPs had already undertaken the education component prior to the
HEE pilot commencing. The resource use related to the 999 call handling, dispatch of an ambulance, cost of conveyance
and admission to the ED was calculated using reference costs published by NHS Improvement [15] (Table 1). For example, a
non-conveyance would comprise the cost of answering a 999 call and cost of sending an ambulance (see and treat). In the
event that a recall was made within 72 hours, the total cost for the non-conveyance would be the 999 call, ambulance
(see and treat) plus the cost of the second call i.e. 999 call and ambulance (see and treat or see, treat and convey plus ED
attendance).

Bootstrapping was used to estimate uncertainty (reported as 95% bootstrapped conﬁdence intervals) around cost estimates.
Costs of those patients seen by intervention group SPs was compared with matched controls and the results presented as
the cost per appropriate conveyance and cost-eﬀectiveness ratio.
Results
As part of the HEE rotational paramedic pilot, 10 SPs undertook a 10 week placement in a primary care setting in the Leeds
area. Five commenced their placement in June 2018, with a further three starting in August 2018 and the ﬁnal two starting
their placement in October 2018.
Between 1st June 2017 and 31st December, 2019 there were 8849 incidents attended by one of the intervention group SPs.
Once data was adjusted to remove any cases during the 10 week GP placement, and outside of the 12 months prior to the
start of the rotation and 12 months after the end of the rotation, 7349 cases remained. A further 6 had no sex recorded,
15 had no age recorded and 8 had no post code, leaving 7326/7349 (99.7%) cases. A further 4 cases were excluded due to
                                                                     4

a missing index of multiple deprivation decile (3 cases), rural urban classiﬁcation (3 cases) and/or prevalence of missing
long-term condition data (4 cases), leaving 7322/7349 (99.6%) cases. Finally, no working impression was included in 1785
cases, resulting in a ﬁnal dataset of 5537/7349 (75.3%) cases for inclusion in the ﬁnal analysis. Due to the high number
of missing working impressions, a sensitivity analysis was performed excluding the working impression as a variable
(Appendix 1).
Matched dataset for analysis
The matching algorithm utilised 5198/5537 (93.9%) cases. Overall, the control group was closely matched to the rotational
paramedic (intervention group) incidents (deﬁned as less than 10% in standardised mean diﬀerence). Only the NEWS risk
category and prevalence of long-term conditions were outside this limit.
Pre- and Post-rotation exploratory data analysis
In addition to the substantial reduction in number of cases attended in the post-placement phase, there were also other
diﬀerences in pre- and post-placement cases, which could have contributed to the change in rate of non-conveyance,
validating the decision to include a matched control (Table 2).

Operational activity was higher pre-placement (Figure 1), since intervention group SPs had to undertake a range of
additional activities in the post-placement phase, including staﬃng a dedicated SP dispatch desk in EOC and working in GP
practices as part of the HEE pilot (Table 3). Post-placement, there were also diﬀerences in triage call category (a marker of
perceived acuity following telephone triage of the call), and physiological acuity based on the NEWS risk category that the
SPs were tasked to attend (Figures 2 and 3).

Time series
Figure 4 illustrates the change in raw and ﬁtted CITS model data between the pre- and post-placement phase. There was
no indication of auto-regression, where future values are based on past values (Durbin-Watson statistic 2.37, p=0.79).
Post-placement, the intervention group signiﬁcantly increased their appropriate non-conveyance rate by 35.0% (95%CI
23.8–46.2%, p=<0.001) relative to the control group (Table 4). However, there was a non-statistically signiﬁcant decrease
in the trend of appropriate non-conveyance relative to the control group of -1.2% (95%CI -2.8–0.5%, p=0.156). The
sensitivity analysis (excluding working impression as a matching variable) demonstrated a smaller increase appropriate
non-conveyance in the intervention group relative to the control group of 27.1% (95%CI 16.4–37.7%, p<0.001), and smaller
decrease in the trend of appropriate non-conveyance (-0.9%, 95%CI -2.4–0.6%, p=0.247).

Economic analysis
Post-placement, the cost per appropriate non-conveyance for intervention paramedics was a mean of £509.42 (95%
bootstrapped CI £485.94–£535.41) versus £1124.41 (95% bootstrapped CI £1041.89–£1218.31) for the control group. This
represents a mean saving of £615 per appropriate non-conveyance (95% bootstrapped CI £545.31–£686.69) for intervention
group SPs compared to the control group and a cost-eﬀectiveness ratio of £1758.89 per percentage increase in appropriate
non-conveyance (95% bootstrapped CI £1477.76–£2133.08).
The sensitivity analysis (excluding working impression) calculated the mean post-placement cost per appropriate non-
conveyance for intervention group SPs to be £528.2 (95% bootstrapped CI £504.04–£554.81) versus £1078.29 (95%
bootstrapped CI £1002.63–£1162.04) for the control group. This represents a mean saving of £550.09 per appropriate
non-conveyance (95% bootstrapped CI £489.79–£616.15) for intervention group SPs compared to the control group and
a cost-eﬀectiveness ratio of £2032.74 per percentage increase in appropriate non-conveyance (95% bootstrapped CI
£1674.07–£2546.84).
Discussion
In this single NHS ambulance service study, we found a clinically important and statistical signiﬁcant increase in appropriate
non-conveyance of patients following a 10-week GP practice placement. In addition, this intervention proved to be cost
saving compared to usual care. These results needs to be interpreted with caution, since they only include data from
a single ambulance service with less than 10% of all paramedics currently in the role of SP. Training and experiential
opportunities do vary between organisations, in part likely due to the piecemeal way in which the advanced practice roles
have evolved for paramedics in the UK [9]. YAS has been commissioning the education of SPs with local Higher Education
Institutions since 2014, with a focus on minor illness and injury, and long-term conditions, which is likely to resonate with
other similar schemes [16]. Furthermore, YAS have continued to work to develop their workforce model aligned to the
College of Paramedics post-registration career framework since 2015 [17].
There were diﬀerences in the acuity and working impressions of patients between pre- and post-GP placement, supporting
the choice of methodology for this study. Since cases were matched, it is possible to see how the control group of
paramedics also achieved increased rates of appropriate non-conveyance when tasked to cases allocated a lower triage
call category and NEWS risk category (Table 2). However, even when accounting for case matching, intervention group SPs
had a 35% improvement in appropriate non-conveyance compared to the control group. In addition, there were lower
proportions of certain types of working impressions, such as acute cardiac and convulsions, and higher proportions for
others, such as falls and minor injuries, reﬂecting dedicated tasking by SPs staﬃng a dispatch desk in EOC. It is possible
that these proportions may have had a greater diﬀerence had the desk not closed in June 2019, perhaps reﬂecting the
increased number of incidents attended by SPs in the ﬁnal 3 months of the post-placement period. This may also correlate
with the non-statistically signiﬁcant drop in non-conveyance rates and increase in acuity of triage call categories seen at
the same time.
Overall, SPs attended less cases in the post-placement phase. In addition to attending 999 calls, intervention group SPs
also fulﬁlled other roles, including rotating back into GP surgeries (18% of post-placement hours) and staﬃng the desk in
EOC (29.9%). This resulted in a drop in time responding to 999 calls from 84.4% pre-placement to 60.6% after (Table 3).
While availability for operational shifts reduced, the improved appropriate non-conveyance rates suggest that ambulance
services should focus on EOC processes to maximise appropriate dispatching for specialist and advanced practice roles to
999 calls.
The non-conveyance rates seen in this study are diﬃcult to compare with other reported statistics, since the population
included in this study is diﬀerent to all emergency call activity. For example, in the intervention group’s pre-placement
                                                                     9

phase, there was a higher proportion of category 1 and 2 calls (75–76.9%) compared to YAS ﬁgures reported nationally
(64%), but a lower proportion post-placement, due to greater case selection with the introduction of the dedicated SP
tasking desk [18]. During the study period, YAS ‘see and treat’ rates were between 22.9–25.4% which was lower than the
English average of 29.3–30.7% [19].
An evaluation of the ﬁrst phase of the rotating paramedic pilot reported non-conveyance rates of at least 70%, which
mirrors the performance of rotating advanced paramedics in Wales [20]. Two sites in the rotating paramedic pilot had non-
conveyance rates in excess of 90%, however these schemes were primary care focused, rather than fully ambulance service
based, highlighting the diﬀerent models commissioned during the pilot. Further evaluation is required to understand the
most appropriate model for a paramedic rotation that beneﬁts all parts of the system.
In YAS, the integration into the primary care teams during the Leeds rotation enabled the SPs to develop a greater
understanding of the local healthcare system as they navigated pathways across community and acute care. This knowledge
could then be utilised when the SPs rotated back into YAS and either responding to 999 calls or working in the EOC
to identify appropriate 999 calls for an SP response. However, the impact of improved clinical knowledge and greater
understanding of local pathways, and their eﬀect on clinical practice and decision-making is uncertain, and requires further
research. Despite this, the value of paramedics being aﬀorded the opportunity to undertake a primary care placement has
been demonstrated in this study and supports the qualitative ﬁndings from the HEE evaluation. This suggests that support
and education from GPs, an appreciation of primary care and other health and social care agencies and the opportunity to
develop inter-service, multi-disciplinary relationships across the health and social care system, are beneﬁcial to patient
care [10].
Limitations
It is important to acknowledge this study’s limitations. We used routine observational data rather than conducting a
randomised-controlled trial for example, which was not possible since the rotation had already completed on commence-
ment of this work. The outcome of this study, while patient focused, could not capture episodes where patients presented
to other sectors of the healthcare system as a result of a complication of not being conveyed to hospital. In addition,
identifying re-contacts, relied on identiﬁcation of cases either by NHS number or a combination of patient name, age and
incident location which may have been missing on subsequent calls.
The number of missing working impression codes was not anticipated, and so no contingency was made in the methodology
to account for this. While the sensitivity analysis showed that this is likely to have had a modest impact on our ﬁndings, in
retrospect this study would have been more robust with a plan to take account of this.
Finally, it became apparent once the data was provided that determining the grade of paramedic with any certainty was
not possible, which may have inﬂated the performance of the control group by inclusion of SPs who had not taken part in
the HEE pilot.
Conclusion
In this single UK NHS ambulance service study, we found a clinically important and statistically signiﬁcant increase in
appropriate non-conveyance rates by specialist paramedics who had completed a 10-week GP rotation. This improvement
persisted for the 12-month period following the rotation and demonstrated cost savings compared to usual care.

Appendix A
Due to the high number of missing working impressions, we conducted a sensitivity analysis including data that was
matched without working impression as a variable. Figure 5 shows the change in proportion of appropriate non-conveyance
in this group and can be compared with Figure 4. The results of the segmented regression can be seen in Table 5.
