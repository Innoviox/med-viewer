        Abstract
        Background: The selection criterion for hepatic resection(HR) in intermediate-stage(IM) hepatocellular
        carcinoma(HCC) is still controversial. This study aims to compare transarterial chemoembolisation
        (TACE) and HR in the range of predicted overall mortality(OM).
        Methods: In all, 946 consecutive patients with IM-HCC were categorised in HR and TACE group. We
        performed multivariable Cox regression model to predict OM in HR patients. To evaluate the HR
        impact on OM concerning baseline characteristics, we test the interaction between predicted OM risk
        and HR status. The cut-off values were determined by two-piece-wise linear regression model and
        decision curve analysis. Also, the inverse probability of treatment weight was performed to minimise
        potential bias as a sensitivity analysis.
        Findings: Totally, 23.0% (n=225) of patients received HR. The 5-yr overall survival rate was higher in
        the HR group versus the TACE group (52.3% vs 22.8%; p<0.0001). In the HR group, five predictors
        (all<0.05) were selected to calculate the 5-yr OM risk. This model also used to predict the 5-yr
        OM-free survival rate. The line of HR and TACE was crossing with predicted OM risk at 100%. The
        benefit of HR versus TACE decreased progressively as predicted OM risk>55%. When OM risk >80%,
        HR was not significantly superior to TACE (HR:0.61;95%CI:0.31,1.21), and both HR and TACE did
        not increase net benefit.
        Interpretation: Hepatic resection was superior to transarterial chemoembolisation for intermediate-stage
        hepatocellular carcinoma at the 5-yr OM risk<80%. And TACE was suitable for the patients with OM
        risk>80%.

        1.Introduction
           Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) is one of the most leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide
        and the fifth cause of death in China1. According to the BCLC staging system, the most widely used
        scheme, patients with early stages(stage 0 and A) are suitable for hepatic resection(HR), while
        intermediate-stage(IM) HCC patients are recommended for transarterial chemoembolization(TACE)2.
        When compared with conservative treatment for IM-stage(stage B) HCC, patients treated with TACE
        have better 2-year overall survival3. After selected by the Bolondi’s criteria4, the patients with stage B1
        or B2 have a higher 5-year survival rate（21.4% vs13.9%） 5. Subsequently, the subgroup of IM-stage
        HCC patients who benefit from TACE was identified through numerous criteria, including the ART
        score6, ABCR score7, the ALBI grade8, etc. Although the highly selected HCC patients have a median
        survival of 51.5 months9, the role of TACE is being challenged by hepatic resection(HR).
           Recently, a meta-analysis including 18 high-quality studies is performed to compared survival
        outcomes of 5,986 patients after HR and TACE. They find that both stage B and stage C patients show
        significantly better overall survival (OS) for HR compared to TACE10. However, the controversial
        evidence has emerged that HR is superior to TACE only in the lower mortality risk subgroup of
        IM-stage HCC11-15, such as BCLC stage B1/B212,13. Although the subgroup of IM-stage HCC has been
        selected by the predicted models16 with median overall survival of 61.3 months, patients who are more
        suitable for HR is still controversial. Interestingly, Cucchetti et al17 perform a regret-based decision
        curve analysis (Regret-DCA) to choose HR or TACE for IM-stage HCC. In this study, HR should be
        offered to the patients with 3yr mortality risk<35%, but the optimal strategy(HR vs TACE) is still
        unclear when mortality risk between 35% and 70%. To deal with this issue, we construct a predicted
        mortality    risk-based        decision    analysis    to  compare     hepatic    resection    and   transarterial
        chemoembolization in the intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma,
        2. Methods and patients
        2.1 Patient selection
           Clinical and biological data in our study had been previously published in full18. In this study, we
        mainly focus on the derivation cohort from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center(SYSUCC) between
        January 2007 and May 2012. The details of inclusion criteria were shown in Fig S1. A total of 979
        patients were included in the derivation cohort. In the derivation cohort, 37(37/979, 3.8%) patients were
        excluded for refusing to received treatment and 942 patients were included into final analysis, with
        TACE (n=717, 73.2%) or surgical resection(n=225, 23.0%) as their first-line treatment. According to
        the decision form multidisciplinary teams, the subsequent therapies include ablative therapies
        (n=94/805, 11.7%), surgical resection(n=43/805, 5.3%), repeated TACE(n=235/805, 29.2%), targeted
        therapies (n=6/805, 0.7%) , or best supportive care (n=427/805, 53.0%).
           The study protocol (2017-FXY-129) was approved by the Ethics Committee of SYSUCC and
        another three medical centres. Because this was a retrospective study, the informed consent was
        waived.
        2.2 Diagnosis, treatment and follow-up
           For the patients treated with HR, HCC diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of
        surgical samples. For the patients with TACE, in contrast, the diagnosis was confirmed by the
        combination with the serum level of alpha-fetoprotein(AFP, over than 400 ng/mL) and clinical imaging,

        including ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. If the diagnosis
        was uncertain based on imaging and AFP level, a needle biopsy was performed.
            Based on the decision from the multidisciplinary teams, the optimal treatment plans were adopted
        for each HCC patient. Indications for HR in the IM-HCC patients were the presence of appropriate
        residual liver volume determined by computed tomography. For the patients without cirrhosis, 30%
        remnant liver volume after HR was considered adequate. For those with chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis,
        and severe fatty liver, however, the remnant volume should be more than 50%. Liver resection should
        not be carried out among the patients with intermediate or advanced cirrhosis and poor liver
        function(Child-Pugh C). Patients who satisfied the indications for HR were treated by surgical
        resection unless the patient requested TACE.
           During the period of initial treatment for the first 2 years, patients were followed up for every 2 or 3
        months if complete remission was achieved. The frequency gradually decreased to every 3 to 6 months
        after 2 years’ remission.
        2.3 Variables and definition
           Patients were stratified as the group of hepatic resection(HR) and transarterial chemoembolisation
        (TACE). HR was defined as surgical therapy for the lesions in hepatic segments or lobes. In the clinical,
        patients with well liver function and less tumour loading were usually suitable for HR. TACE was
        defined as chemoembolisation of the hepatic artery. Continuous variables included age, the diameter of
        the main tumour, alpha-fetoprotein(AFP), prothrombin time(PT), total bilirubin(TBLT) at diagnosis.
        AFP and TBLT were transformed to the Log10 scale because of their left skew. Categorical variables
        consisted of gender (female and male), No. of intrahepatic lesions (≤3, >3), both lobe with lesions(no,
        yes). All variables were afforded before any anti-cancer treatment. The endpoint of interest was overall
        mortality at 5 yr.
        2.4 Statistical analyses
           To compare differences of baseline characteristics between the HR and TACE groups, we compared
        categorical variables with the chi-square test and continuous variables by the Mann-Whitney test.
           To test the OM-free survival between HR and TACE in the range of OM risk, we divide the
        statistical analyses into two main parts.
           Firstly, Kaplan-Meier methods were used to calculate OM-free survival rates for the HR and TACE
        cohorts. Also, we employed multivariable Cox regression(MVR) to develop the MVR model. In this
        study, the covariates(all p<0.05 between two groups) list in Table 1 were used to build the MVR
        model18, including the continuous covariates of age, PT and diameter of the main tumour, as well as the
        categorical covariates No. of intrahepatic lesions, both lobe with lesions. To assess discrimination of
        the model, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated. Besides,
        through decision curve analysis, we calculated the net benefit of the model and determined the cut-off
        value through two reference strategies(test none or test all).
           Secondly, to evaluate the interaction between HR and OM risk, we used the method20 as follow:
        (1)we used Model Ⅰ to test the association between OM and covariates in HR patients. From this model,
        OM-risk at 5 yr was predicted to establish a baseline OM risk for both HR and TACE cohort, (2) this
        predicted OM risk was added as a covariate to a second multivariate Cox model to calculate the
        predicted probability of survival at 5 yr, and (3) interaction between HR and OM risk was graphed
        using spline smoothing based on generalised additive model. Furthermore, a two-piece-wise linear

        regression and the recursive method was performed to calculate the inflexion point of the TACE line,
        and a log-likelihood ratio test was used to compare the one-line linear regression.
           We performed the number needed to treat (NNT) analysis to explore how the NNT varies with
        predicted OM risk at 5yr. Stratified analysis was performed to examine the hazard ratio(vs TACE) for
        each different 20% proportion based on 5-yr predicted OM-risk. Meanwhile, the 5-yr observed survival
        probability of TACE cohort was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier curve. Then, we calculate NNT by the
        formulas of Altman and Andersen21.
        2.5 Sensitivity analysis
           Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using inverse probability of treatment weight (IPTW) to
        eliminate inherent differences between two groups. The propensity score(PS) was estimated as the
        predicted probability of treating with HR in each patient. IPTW was then calculated as the inverse of
        the PS for HR patients and as the inverse of (1-PS) for the TACE patients. To eliminate the effect of
        ablative therapies and surgical resection after first-line treatment, we builded a secondary cohort
        without those therapies. All the analyses mentioned in the second step were repeated in the IPTW and
        secondary cohort.
           Statistical analysis was performed using Empower (www.empowerstats.com, X&Y solutions, inc.
        Boston MA) and R software (version 3.4.3). P-value < 0.05 considered significant.
        3. Results
        3.1 Descriptive characteristics
           After excluding those who refused to receive treatment(n=33), a total of 942 HCC patients were
        included into the derivation cohort, with a median age of 53.9 (SD, 12.3) years for TACE
        group(n=717), and 50.9(SD, 12.6) years for HR group(n=225). After first-line treatment with TACE,
        46 patients(6.6%, 46/597) had the invasion of portal vein or its branch (n=38), hepatic veins(n=6) and
        Vena Canva/Atrium(n=2), 53 patients(8.9%, 53/597) with distant metastasis, while 36 patients(6.0%,
        36/597) with lymph node metastasis at the second follow-up visit. Besides, for the HR group, 11
        patients(5.3%, 11/208) had the invasion of portal vein or its branch, 16 patients(7.7%, 16/208) with
        distant metastasis, while 4 patients(1.9%, 4/208) with lymph node metastasis.
           In the derivation cohort, patients with HR were younger, higher PT value, the shorter diameter of the
        main tumour, less frequently No. of intrahepatic lesions and both lobe with lesions(all p<0.05), which
        was shown in Table 1. The majority of the patient (825/942,87.6%) had hepatitis B virus(HBV)
        infection, who treated with nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy. The difference of HBV infection rate was
        not significant between HR and TACE group.
        3.2 Survival analysis for the entire cohort
           As was shown in Fig 1, the mOS is 18.5(95%CI:16.9, 20.3) month for TACE group versus
        67.4(95%CI:46.7, 88.1) for HR group (p<0.0001). The median overall survival(mOS) for the entire
        cohort was 23.7 (95%CI:20.4, 27.2) month. There were 89 cases (89/942, 9.4%) still at risk at 5 yr. At
        5 yr, OM-free survival rates was 30.6% (95%CI: 27.0%, 34.6%) for the entire cohort, and it was 52.3%
        (95% CI：44.9%, 61.0%) for HR group versus 22.8%(95%CI: 19.0%, 27.4%) for the TACE group (p <
        0.0001).
           In multivariable analysis focusing on the entire cohort (Table 2), age(HR,1.00; 95%CI: 0.99, 1.01),
        PT(HR,1.07; 95%CI:1.00, 1.14), diameter of main tumor(HR,1.15; 95%CI:1.13, 1.18), No. of

        intrahepatic lesions(HR,1.12; 95%CI:0.80, 1.57 for 3 vs 2; HR,1.59;95%CI:1.31, 1.93 for >3 vs 2,
        respectively), both lobe with lesions(HR,1.51; 95%CI:1.26, 1.80) were identified as the predictor for
        the MVR model. By decision curve analysis, we found that none could receive a net benefit from HR
        and TACE for OM risk >80% ; maximal utility occurred at 55%(Fig S2).
           Next, the predictors in MVR model were used to predict 5-yr OM risk and OM-free survival rate for
        the entire cohort. The predict OM risk was plotted against OM-free survival, and the lines for HR and
        TACE crossed at 100%(Fig 2). Consistent with the maximal utility point of DCA, the inflexion point of
        TACE line was calculated at 55%(p<0.001, Table 3), indicating the benefit from HR decreased
        progressively as predicted OM risk >55%. Interestingly, the predicted survival rate of TACE line at
        55% was 20% (95%CI:19%, 22%), which was in the interval of observed OM-free survival at 5yr for
        TACE group(22.78%, 95%CI: 18.96%, 27.37%).
            Fig 3 showed the results of NNT analysis. After incorporating the missing data into the group of
        40-50%(Table S1), hazard ratios were 0.40(95%CI: 0.26, 0.61), 0.41(95%CI: 0.28, 0.60),
        0.40(95%CI:0.24, 0.68) and 0.61(95%CI:0.31,1.21) for each group. According to the formulas,
        NNT was not significantly available at the group of OM risk>80%.
        3.4 Sensitivity analysis
           The details of results after IPTW and secondary cohort were shown in Supplementary Appendix
        A and B. All results from the IPTW and secondary cohort were similar to the derivation cohort.
        4.Discussion
           In this large-scale, real-world data, the 5-yr OM-free survival curve of HR and TACE were
        comparing in predicted OM risk for the range of 20%-100%. We found that the overall survival for HR
        was significantly better than their TACE counterparts, which was consistent with previous literature10,22.
        However, the net benefit from HR decreased progressively as predicted OM risk >55%. When OM
        risk >80%, HR was not significantly superior to TACE for the patients with BCLC-B HCC, and both
        HR and TACE did not increase net benefit. To best of our knowledge, we first defined the predicted
        mortality risk-based decision analysis to select the optimal therapy.
           Our study had several important findings. When compared with TACE group, we found that the
        benefit from HR was nonlinearly associated with baseline 5-yr OM risk; maximal net benefit occurred
        at 55%. In 2015, Colombo et al23 had come up with an assumption that intermediate-stage HCC
        patients could still be suitable for liver resection if the 5-yr survival rate reached 50%. Our
        findings primarily validated this hypothesis. In line with previous literatures13,14, we identified a
        subgroup with OM risk<80%, in which patients treated with HR had significantly better overall
        survival than TACE group. Based on the Bolondi's sub-staging model4, Wei et al13 the postoperative
        5-yr survival rate for patients in the BCLC B1-B3 stage was 49.5%, 33.7% and 12.9%,
        respectively. But only the patients with BCLC B1/B2 had an optimal long-term survival than
        TACE group. In another large-scale study14, the benefit from liver resection was observed in the
        patients of BCLC-B1/B2 but not B3/B4.
           Surprisingly, we also found an increase of 1% mortality rate(HR:1.01;95%CI:0.72,1.72) from
        hepatic resection in OM risk for the range of 80%-100% in IPTW cohort but not significantly(Fig A3).
        In a high-quality meta-analysis10, the 5-yr survival rate of advanced-stage HCC in the TACE group
        range from 0% to 21%. It implied that the subgroup of 80%-100% OM risk might be contained in the

        BCLC-C HCC patients. Therefore, TACE may be more suitable for patients with OM risk>80%.
           Our study had some strengths, including providing the cut-off accuracy value to evaluate the tumour
        loading. Specifically, in our study, the survival rates between HR and TACE were compared in the vast
        and continuous range, so that the exact cut-off values could be calculated. Besides, because the cases in
        our study had already been treated, the selected bias was avoided. When evaluating the role of liver
        resection among patients with anatomically resectable tumour and well liver function, the randomized
        control trial was obviously against medical ethics. Therefore, the predicted mortality risk-based
        decision analysis for the real-world data may be a better choice.
           Our study also had several limitations. Firstly, this was a retrospective cohort from real-world data,
        residual bias, and unmeasured confounders were unavoidable, even if we had used the inverse
        probability of treatment weight to eliminate inherent differences between two groups. Secondly, the
        patients in this study were from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, one of the top-level hospitals of
        China. Our conclusions might be not suitable for patients in primary healthcare organizations.
        Besides, the leading cause of HCC in the Chinese populations was HBV-associated cirrhosis and
        non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the western country. Whether the liver resection was superior
        to TACE in western populations was still unknown. Thirdly, the percentage of resectable HCC
        patients in the TACE group with 5-yr OM risk< 80% were unclear. However, it was worthy of
        note that the potential unresectable HCC patients treated with TACE resulting from such errors
        would bias toward to the null and lead to an underestimation of the net benefit from liver resection
        versus TACE.
           In the future, more attention should be caught to find the optimised combinations in the patients
        with 5yr OM risk<80%, such as hepatic resection, TACE, local ablation. Besides, for the
        intermediate-stage HCC with OM risk>80%, TACE combined with targeted drugs24 or immunotherapy
        may the promising selection.
