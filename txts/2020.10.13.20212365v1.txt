   Abstract
   The association between a common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype and alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (ACP),
   which was revealed by the first genome-wide association study of chronic pancreatitis (CP), has been
   consistently replicated. However, the association with non-ACP (NACP) has been controversial.
   Herein, we sought to clarify this basic issue by means of an allele-based meta-analysis of currently
   available studies. We then used studies informative for genotype distribution to explore the
   biological mechanisms underlying the association data and to test for gene-environment interaction
   between the risk haplotype and alcohol consumption by means of a re-analysis. A literature search
   was conducted to identify eligible studies. Meta-analysis was performed using the Review Manager
   software. The association between the risk genotypes and NACP or ACP was tested for the best-
   fitting genetic model. Gene-environment interaction was estimated by both case-only and
   multinomial approaches. Five and eight studies were employed for the meta-analysis of ACP and
   NACP findings, respectively. The risk allele was significantly associated with both ACP (pooled OR
   1.67, 95% CI 1.56–1.78; P<0.00001) and NACP (pooled OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.17–1.40; P<0.00001).
   Consistent with a dosage effect of the risk allele on PRSS1/PRSS2 mRNA expression in human
   pancreatic tissue, both ACP and NACP association data were best explained by an additive genetic
   model. Finally, the risk haplotype was found to interact synergistically with ACP.

   INTRODUCTION
   Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a chronic inflammatory process of the pancreas that leads to irreversible
   morphological changes and progressive impairment of both exocrine and endocrine functions (1, 2).
   CP can be caused by genetic and/or environmental factors (3). In the one extreme, rare gain-of-
   function missense or copy number variants in the PRSS1 gene (encoding cationic trypsinogen; MIM#
   276000) can cause autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis (4, 5). In the other extreme, alcohol
   abuse is the most frequent environmental factor causing CP worldwide (2, 3).
        Eight years ago, the first genome-wide association study of CP was published; a common PRSS1-
   PRSS2 haplotype was reported to be associated with both alcoholic CP (ACP) and non-ACP (NACP)
   (6). PRSS2 encodes anionic trypsinogen (MIM# 601564), the second major trypsinogen isoform after
   cationic trypsinogen. This association has a strong biological basis: the risk [C] allele of the lead single
   nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs10273639C/T, appeared to be associated with increased PRSS1
   mRNA expression in pancreatic tissue in a dosage-dependent manner (6). rs10273639C/T is in
   perfect linkage disequilibrium with rs4726576C/A, which is located 204 bp upstream of the
   translation initiation codon of the PRSS1 gene; the C allele of rs4726576C/A increased reporter gene
   expression as determined by an in vitro promoter assay (7). Uncontrolled trypsin activity is central to
   CP  pathogenesis

        Another interesting finding from the Whitcomb study was that rs10273639C/T was associated
   with a stronger genetic effect in ACP than in NACP, suggesting that the SNP-conferred risk was
   amplified by alcohol consumption. Moreover, in a case-only analysis, the SNP seemed to interact
   with ACP (6). In subsequent studies, the association of the common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype with
   ACP has been consistently replicated. However, the association with NACP was equivocal, raising the
   possibility that the common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype modifies CP risk only for ACP but not in NACP
   (9, 10). To explore this basic question and the underlying biological mechanisms, we firstly
   performed an allele-based meta-analysis of the reported associations between the common PRSS1-
   PRSS2 haplotype and ACP and NACP. We then used informative studies in terms of genotype
   distribution to perform a new re-analysis with respect to (i) the fit of different genetic models to the
   association data and (ii) the gene-environment interaction between the common PRSS1-PRSS2
   haplotype and alcohol consumption status in CP.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   Literature search and inclusion criteria
   The literature search was performed by keyword search (PRSS1 and Pancreatitis) via PubMed (as of
   13 July 2020), which was complemented by perusal of references citing the Whitcomb and/or Derikx
   studies (6, 9) via Google Scholar. Only studies that satisfied the following criteria were included for
   meta-analysis: (i) published in a peer-reviewed journal; (ii) the common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype was
   analyzed in both ACP and/or NACP patients and controls; and (iii) the tagging SNP of interest was in
   Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in the controls.
   Data extraction
   The protective alleles of the SNPs that tagged the common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype have often been
   used for statistical analysis in previous publications. To consider the genetic effects of both rare and
   common PRSS1 variants in the same framework, herein we used the risk alleles of the tagging SNPs
   for analysis. To this end, risk allele or genotype distribution data in patients and controls were
   manually extracted from included studies.
   Statistical analysis and meta-analysis with respect to risk allele frequencies in patients and
   controls
   The assessment of significance of the differences between the frequencies of the risk-tagging SNPs
   in patients and controls in the context of each study was performed by means of χ2 tests in R (11). A
   difference was regarded as being statistically significant when the P value was ≤0.05. The sample size
   for case-control association studies was estimated using the Online Sample Size Estimator (12).
        Meta-analysis, heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses, and forest plots were all performed using
   the Review Manager 5.3 software (13). Funnel plots were not performed due to the small number of
   eligible studies (13, 14). The Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect or random effect model was used to
   compute pooled odds ratio (OR) in the absence or presence of statistical heterogeneity.
   Heterogeneity was considered to be significant when the P value for the test of heterogeneity was
   <0.05 or I2 was 50% or more (13, 15). The conduct and reporting of the meta-analysis were
   essentially in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines (16). This meta-analysis was not registered in
   PROSPERO (17), which does not allow the registration of already finished studies.
   Evaluation of the effect of rs10273639 on the expression of PRSS1 and PRSS2 in pancreatic tissue
   This analysis was performed using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset (18).
   Re-analysis for association between the common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype and ACP/NACP under
   different genetic models
   Logistic regression models were fitted to examine the association between the risk genotypes and
   NACP or ACP in the context of single population data (refer to Results). Four models were tested: the

   genotypes were coded as either recessive, dominant, additive, or as each having an independent
   effect (general model) (19). We evaluated the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for each model and
   tested the change in deviance of the recessive, dominant, and additive models against the general
   model. Pearson’s residuals were calculated to ensure the reasonability of the models fitted. All
   analyses were carried out using the statistical analysis software R (version 3.6.1) (11).
   Re-analysis to test for interaction between the common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype and alcohol
   consumption status in CP
   The studies included in this analysis were those for which we could ascertain individual level
   genotype data for ACP, NACP and healthy control individuals. We firstly performed case-only
   analyses before combining results through meta-analysis in order to estimate a pooled OR for the
   interaction term (also referred to as the synergy index SIM). This analysis was performed using the
   metagen function from the meta R package (20).
        In a second step, we applied the multinomial approach to test for gene-environment interactions
   as proposed by Kazma and colleagues (21). ACP and NACP patients were compared using the control
   individuals as a common baseline through a multinomial logistic regression model (multinom
   function from the nnet R package) (22). This method of investigating the gene-environment
   interaction is equivalent to the case-only approach (23); testing the interaction on a multiplicative
   scale (24). However, unlike the case-only approach, the multinomial model allows us to also include
   a control group and hence to simultaneously estimate the genetic effects and test for the presence
   of an interaction term, thereby giving a more complete description.
   RESULTS
   Included studies for meta-analysis
   The keyword search (PRSS1 and Pancreatitis) via PubMed resulted in 173 entries starting from the
   pioneering Whitcomb study (6). Of these, 15 publications were identified to report original data on
   the frequency of the common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype in both pancreatitis patients and controls.
   Two studies that analyzed patients with a known non-alcohol-related external factor (25, 26) and
   three studies that analyzed only patients with acute pancreatitis (27-29) were immediately excluded
   from further consideration. Two additional reports that analyzed chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients
   were also excluded: one (30) because of a significant overlap of patients with a previous study (9)
   and the other due to its small sample size (i.e., only 85 CP cases and 78 controls were successfully
   genotyped) and lack of information on the numbers of CP subtypes among the analyzed patients
   (31). The remaining eight studies were included in our meta-analysis; five of these reported data on
   both alcoholic CP (ACP) and non-ACP (NACP) (6, 9, 10, 32, 33) whereas the other three reported data
   only for NACP (34-36). The search and selection processes of the included studies are outlined in
   Figure 1. In all included studies, the tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of interest was
   either described in the original publication or verified here to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in
   the controls. Additionally, all included studies were evaluated to have a Newcastle-Ottawa Scale
   (NOS) score (37) of ≥7. Finally, perusal of references citing the Whitcomb study (6) and/or the Derikx
   study (9) via Google Scholar did not identify additional eligible studies in peer-reviewed journals.
        Basic characteristics of the eight included studies are summarized in Table 1. It should be noted
   that, in the Whitcomb study, the ACP and NACP cohorts actually comprised some patients with
   recurrent acute pancreatitis; CP and recurrent acute pancreatitis were modeled together based
   upon the assumption that the two disease states have common susceptibilities (6). As opined by the
   original authors, this treatment may reduce power relative to that of the analysis of CP alone but is
   unlikely to have altered the main conclusions of the study.
   Allele-based meta-analysis confirmed an association of the common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype with
   both ACP and NACP

   Although the frequencies of the risk-tagging alleles differ significantly (from 22% to 58%) between
   the American (primarily of European ancestry), European, Japanese, Indian and Hungarian control
   populations studied, all five ACP studies found a statistically significant association between the
   common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype and ACP with remarkably comparable ORs (i.e., 1.64 to 1.85; Table
   1). Application of the test for heterogeneity confirmed that the five studies were homogeneous (χ2 =
   0.68, P = 0.95; I2 = 0%). The pooled OR (under a fixed effect model) was 1.67 (95% CI 1.56–1.78; P <
   0.00001) (Figure 2).
        Of the eight NACP studies, five found a statistically significant association with NACP whereas the
   other three did not (Table 1). The test for heterogeneity revealed significant heterogeneity across
   the studies (χ2 = 15.81, P = 0.03; I2 = 56%). Sensitivity analysis identified the large European study (9)
   to be the source of the heterogeneity. Using a random-effect model, the common PRSS1-PRSS2
   haplotype showed significant association with NACP: the pooled OR was 1.28 (95% CI 1.17–1.40; P <
   0.00001) (Figure 2).
        The three studies that failed to show a significant association with NACP nevertheless all yielded
   ORs >1 (Table 1). Notably, the frequency of the tagging rs6666[C] allele among the Hungarian NACP
   patients was nearly 6% higher than in controls (i.e., 63.1% vs. 57.3%), raising the possibility that the
   absence of an association (P = 0.17) in the corresponding study (10) might have been due to the
   relatively small sample size (only 103 patients and 296 controls were examined). Assuming (i) the
   frequencies of the rs6666[C] allele in the Hungarian NACP patients and controls were 63% and 57%,
   respectively and (ii) a 1:2 ratio of cases to controls, at least 784 patients and 1568 controls would
   have been required to achieve significance at the 5% level with 80% power.
        As for the large European study (9), the risk allele frequency in the NACP patients was 2% higher
   than in the controls, yielding a P value of 0.085 (Table 1). This large study used three NACP cohorts,
   viz. German, French and Dutch. The German cohort was the largest and showed a statistically
   significant association with NACP (OR = 1.21, p = 0.0027; Table 2).
        The third study that failed to achieve a significant association (34) was the smallest of the three
   Indian studies (Table 1).
   The risk allele number is positively correlated with the pancreatic PRSS2 mRNA expression level
   We evaluated whether the risk [C] allele of rs10273639C/T is associated with increased trypsinogen
   gene expression in the pancreas in the GTEx dataset. No significant expression quantitative trait loci
   (eQTLs) for PRSS1 in the pancreas are currently available in GTEx. However, the genotypes of
   rs10273639 affected PRSS2 mRNA expression in the pancreas in a dosage-dependent manner (see
   Supplementary Figure S1).
   The additive genetic model best fits the associations of the common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype with
   NACP and ACP
   The positive correlation between the risk allele number of rs10273639 and in vivo PRSS1 and PRSS2
   mRNA expression implies that an additive genetic model would best explain the association data. To
   test this postulate, we firstly examined the three possible genetic models, namely dominant,
   recessive and additive, in the context of three NACP studies informative for genotype distribution,
   each from a single population (i.e., the only Japanese study (32), the Paliwal study that analyzed the
   largest number of Indian patients (35), and the German cohort (the largest of the European cohorts)
   studied by Derikx et al. (9)). A general model with an independent effect of each genotype was also
   fitted to aid the evaluation of the three models of interest.
        The distribution of the rs10273639 genotypes showed significant differences between patients
   and controls under all three genetic models (Table 3). Pearson’s residuals (which should not greatly
   exceed a value of 2) were calculated to establish that all models had provided a reasonable
   description of the data. By evaluating the Akaike information criterion (AIC), we observed that the
   best fitting model was invariably the additive model as a lower AIC represents a better model fit. On
   examining the general models, we observed that the coefficients for the CC genotype were very

   close to twice the coefficients of the CT genotype (i.e., 0.39 vs. 0.25 in the German data; 0.87 vs.
   0.45 in the Japanese data; and 0.59 vs. 0.34 in the Indian data). This is indicative of an additive dose-
   dependence relationship between the genotypes and the risk of CP. Further, we performed analyses
   of variance (Anova) of the recessive, dominant and additive models against the general model. This
   showed that only the recessive model provided a worse description of the data compared to the
   general model (P values below 0.05) (Table 3).
        We also examined the three possible genetic models in the context of ACP studies. Of the five
   included ACP studies (Table 1), four used only healthy subjects as controls (6, 10, 32, 33). The Derikx
   study (9) additionally used German subjects with alcohol dependence (AD) and alcohol-associated
   liver cirrhosis (ALC) as controls. We therefore limited this analysis exclusively to the German data
   and tested the fit of the three genetic models to ACP association in the context of three control
   datasets. Again, the additive model provided the best fit to each dataset as evaluated by the AIC and
   by Anova tests against the general model. Pearson’s residuals did not indicate that the models fitted
   were unreasonable and in each dataset tested, a clearly significant correlation between genotypes
   of rs10273639 and the case/control status was observed as evidenced by the significant ORs (see
   Supplementary Table S1).
   A synergistic interaction is evident between the common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype and alcohol
   consumption status
   Using data from ACP and NACP patients from Germany, France, Netherlands, Japan and Hungary
   (Table 4), we first performed case-only re-analyses of each dataset to estimate the OR of the
   interaction between alcohol-consumption and copies of the PRSS1/PRSS2 haplotype. Following the
   evaluation of different genetic models in NACP and ACP patients, we selected the best-performing
   additive genetic model for this re-analysis. Subsequently, we performed a meta-analysis of these
   new results in order to calculate a pooled estimate for the interaction term and to assess the
   heterogeneity of the studies. Application of the test for heterogeneity confirmed that the five
   studies were homogeneous (χ2 = 4.78, P = 0.31; I2 = 16.4%). The pooled OR (under a fixed effect
   model) of the interaction (or synergy index SIM) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.26–1.58; P = 2.80 × 10-9). The OR
   being significantly greater than one indicates that the effects between alcohol exposure and the
   haplotype are more than multiplicative (synergistic effect).
        To fully characterize the importance of the interaction, we fitted a multinomial logistic
   regression model to estimate, within a single framework, the risks associated with the PRSS1-PRSS2
   haplotype in both ACP and NACP cases (Table 5). For this analysis, control groups were required
   from each population. It should be noted that the purpose of the model is to compare the ACP and
   NACP against a common baseline and hence no assumption is made about alcohol consumption in
   the control groups. The multinomial model included co-variables indicating the country- and study-
   origin of the data, and we again applied the additive genetic model for the genetic effects. The OR
   for the PRSS1/PRSS2 haplotype was 1.16 (95% CI 1.07–1.26) in the NACP patients and increased to
   1.69 (95% CI 1.54–1.84) in the ACP patients. The difference between these two ORs is statistically
   significant, as evidenced by the non-overlapping confidence intervals, again signaling the presence of
   an interaction between the genetic-effect of the haplotype and alcohol consumption. This model
   allows for a succinct demonstration that alcohol consumption significantly increases the risk
   associated with the presence of copies of the haplotype on a multiplicative scale across the five
   populations.
   DISCUSSION
   We first performed an allele-based meta-analysis of the currently available studies of the association
   between the common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype and ACP and NACP, demonstrating a significant
   association in both contexts. Possible causes underlying the previous contentious NACP findings
   included small sample size, ethnic and population differences in genetic predisposition to CP, and
   differences in patient selection. For example, using only German samples, Derikx and colleagues

   observed a trend towards higher genetic effect sizes in patient groups characterized by a later age of
   disease onset (9), a possible explanation for the lack of a significant association in the French cohort
   (see Table 2). More specifically, a significant association was found in the German patients whose
   age of disease onset was ≥ 20 years but not in those whose age of disease onset was 10-19 years or
   < 10 years; the age of disease onset was invariably < 20 years in all French patients. Additionally, it
   should be noted that PRSS1-PRSS2 rs10273639 was included in a recent meta-analysis, in which ACP
   and NACP were analyzed together (38).
        Having confirmed an association of the common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype with NACP, we further
   explored the underlying biological basis of this association from two complementary standpoints. As
   mentioned earlier, the risk [C] allele of rs10273639C/T has been found to be positively associated
   with PRSS1 mRNA expression in pancreatic tissue. More specifically, PRSS1 expression levels were
   highest in rs10273639[C] homozygotes, intermediate in heterozygotes and lowest in rs10273639[T]
   homozygotes (6). However, the number of pancreatic tissue samples subjected to quantitative
   PRSS1 mRNA expression analysis was limited. We therefore evaluated the effect of rs10273639
   genotypes on pancreatic trypsinogen gene expression using the GTEx dataset and found the level of
   PRSS2 mRNA expression to correlate directly with the dosage of the risk [C] allele of rs10273639. A
   role for PRSS2 in CP is supported by four lines of evidence. Firstly, a loss-of-function PRSS2 variant is
   known to be protective against CP (39). Secondly, CP-causing or predisposing trypsinogen copy
   number variants involve both PRSS1 and PRSS2 (5, 40). Thirdly, the CTRB1-CTRB2 inversion increases
   CP risk by influencing protective PRSS2 degradation (30). Finally, transgenic expression of human
   PRSS2 exacerbates pancreatitis in mice (41). A dosage effect of the risk allele on PRSS1/PRSS2
   expression in the pancreas implies that the additive gene model represents the best fit to explain the
   disease association data. Thus, the second approach we adopted was to test this hypothesis by a
   series of statistical analyses. We demonstrated that the additive genetic model provided the best fit
   in both the ACP and NACP contexts and the genetic effect of the rs10273639 CC genotype was
   approximately double that of the CT genotype. Taken together, these findings provide new insights
   into the pivotal role of increased trypsin in the etiology of CP as well as the genotype-phenotype
   relationship in ACP/NACP.
        Alcohol is an established environmental risk factor for CP (3). However, only 3-5% of heavy
   drinkers develop the disease (42), suggesting the involvement of additional genetic or environmental
   factors in the causation of ACP. A higher OR of the common PRSS1-PRSS2 risk allele associated with
   ACP than with NACP suggests a gene-environment interaction between the common haplotype and
   alcohol consumption in CP. By comparing allele distributions at rs10273639 between 447 ACP
   patients and 1,129 NACP patients, Whitcomb and colleagues (6) suggested the existence of an
   interaction between the PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype and alcohol although they did not attempt to
   quantify it. Herein, by fitting a similar but more sophisticated model and by combining inference
   from data of several studies, we confirm that there is indeed a synergistic interaction between the
   PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype and alcohol consumption status i.e. the risk associated with the presence of
   the PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype and exposure to alcohol was significantly greater than the product of the
   risks associated with each factor singly. Our results are in accordance with those of Whitcomb and
   colleagues but here, by first determining the correct genetic model (additive), and second by
   applying multinomial logistic regression, a more complete characterisation of the etiology of CP
   regarding the PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype and alcohol consumption was possible.
        This study has several limitations. For example, we could not exclude publication bias in terms of
   some of the included studies. We did not perform funnel plots to assess this possibility following
   advice that such a test should be used only when there are at least 10 eligible studies; otherwise the
   power of the test is too low to distinguish a chance effect from genuine asymmetry (13, 14). Despite
   lacking detailed records of individual alcohol consumption levels, we have studied the role of alcohol
   by comparing ACP and NACP cohorts. We can be confident that these two groups will have
   experienced quite different levels of alcohol consumption, and hence the methods applied here are
   appropriate for detecting and describing a gene-environment interaction. More detailed data

   regarding the environmental exposure variable could enable more precision in the characterization
   of the interaction. Moreover, there may exist subtle differences between different cohorts in terms
   of ACP and NACP definitions. Furthermore, none of the included studies employed sex- and age-
   matched controls. However, we consider it unlikely that either of the abovementioned limitations
   would affect the main conclusions drawn owing to the mechanistic evidence underpinning the
   association data.
        In conclusion, the results of our allele-based meta-analysis demonstrated significant association
   of the common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype with both ACP and NACP. In addition, we have provided new
   information that sheds light on the pivotal role of uncontrolled trypsin in CP. Finally, we have refined
   the gene-environment interaction between the common PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype and alcohol
   consumption status in the etiology of CP. These findings help to improve our understanding of the
   complex etiology of CP and strengthen the notion that common risk factors (6, 30, 43) should be
   considered in risk assessment in the clinical setting. Acute pancreatitis patients carrying the common
   PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype should consider greatly reducing their alcohol consumption or abstaining
   altogether.
