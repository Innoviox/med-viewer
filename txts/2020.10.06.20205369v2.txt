  30      Background
  31      The role of specific blood tests to predict poor prognosis in patients admitted with infection from
  32      SARS-CoV2 virus remains uncertain. During the first wave of the global pandemic, an extended
  33      laboratory testing panel was integrated into the local pathway to guide triage and healthcare
  34      resource utilisation for emergency admissions. We conducted a retrospective service evaluation to
  35      determine the utility of extended tests (D-dimer, ferritin, high-sensitivity troponin I, lactate
  36      dehydrogenase, procalcitonin) compared to the core panel (full blood count, urea & electrolytes,
  37      liver function tests, C-reactive protein).
  38      Methods
  39      Clinical outcomes for adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted between 17th
  40      March to 30st June 2020 were extracted, alongside costs estimates for individual tests. Prognostic
  41      performance was assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis with 28-day mortality used
  42      as the primary endpoint, and a composite of 28-day intensive care escalation or mortality for
  43      secondary analysis.
  44      Results
  45      From 13,500 emergency attendances we identified 391 unique adults admitted with COVID-19. Of
  46      these, 113 died (29%) and 151 (39%) reached the composite endpoint. “Core” test variables adjusted
  47      for age, gender and index of deprivation had a prognostic AUC of 0.79 (95% Confidence Interval, CI:
  48      0.67 to 0.91) for mortality and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.56 to 0.84) for the composite endpoint. Addition of
  49      “extended” test components did not improve upon this.
  50      Conclusion
  51      Our findings suggest use of the extended laboratory testing panel to risk stratify community-
  52      acquired COVID-19-positive patients on admission adds limited prognostic value. We suggest
  53      laboratory requesting should be targeted to patients with specific clinical indications.

  55      Introduction:
  56      In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was reported in China, caused by severe
  57      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). In the first 8 months since its
  58      emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 32 million infections and more than a million deaths
  59      worldwide (2). The majority of patients with COVID-19 experience a mild influenza-like illness,
  60      however approximately 15-25% of those admitted to hospital develop pneumonia that may evolve
  61      into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (3-6). Experience from the Italian region of
  62      Lombardy highlighted the potential of uncontrolled COVID-19 outbreaks to rapidly overwhelm local
  63      intensive care capacity and healthcare systems (5). In the United Kingdom, Wales has one of the
  64      lowest number of intensive care beds per head of population in Europe (7, 8), prompting
  65      implementation of scoring systems to support patient triage and allocation of healthcare resources.
  66      The ability to identify patients at greatest risk of developing life-threatening complications from
  67      SARS-CoV-2 infection based on haematological and biochemical laboratory markers was suggested
  68      early in the pandemic. A range of admission tests including D-dimer, ferritin, high-sensitivity
  69      troponin I (hs-Trop), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) have been linked with disease severity and
  70      risk of death (9-13). Similar findings have been replicated in meta-analysis (14). Furthermore, use of
  71      a broader range of laboratory tests in patients with COVID-19 has been supported by the UK Royal
  72      College of Pathologists (15). Accordingly, an extended panel of laboratory tests was integrated
  73      within the standard of care pathway for COVID-19 admissions presenting via the Emergency
  74      Department (ED) of the University Hospital of Wales. This panel consisted of both “core” (full blood
  75      count, FBC; urea & electrolytes, U&E; liver function tests, LFTs; C-reactive protein, CRP) and
  76      “extended” test components (D-dimer; LDH; ferritin; hs-Trop; and procalcitonin, PCT).
  77      A joint National Health Service (NHS)-University collaboration supporting the rapid creation of an
  78      electronic healthcare registry (see extended methods) provided a timely opportunity to
  79      retrospectively assess the value and cost of implementing this extended laboratory panel. This is
  80      particularly relevant given a recent systematic review of methodological and reporting standards
  81      highlighting caution before extrapolating models and decision thresholds derived from prognostic
  82      biomarker studies into local clinical practice (18). The role of extended components remains poorly
  83      represented in prognostic studies within the UK population to date (4, 16-19). We therefore
  84      conducted a service evaluation focusing on the ability of these tests to predict mortality or
  85      escalation to intensive care in the first 28-days following admission, in adult patients with PCR-
  86      confirmed COVID-19. Our primary aim was to assess how addition of components of the extended
  87      panel altered the prognostic performance of the core panel (15). Our secondary aim was to explore
  88      the additional cost of extended testing components. Together, this directs refinement of a risk
  89      stratification panel with potential cost savings ahead of future waves of COVID-19.

  90      Methods
  91      Study population
  92      We identified patients aged ≥ 18 years admitted between 17th March 2020 to 30th June 2020 via the
  93      Emergency Department (ED) of the University Hospital of Wales (Cardiff, UK). This 1,000-bed
  94      hospital is a tertiary referral centre within the region with the greatest recorded total of COVID-19
  95      case positives in Wales (20). Only patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by positive reverse
  96      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal swab, and likely community-
  97      acquired disease (defined as swab positive between 14 days prior or 7 days following the date of
  98      initial emergency attendance) were included. Patients transferred in from other hospitals were
  99      excluded.
 100      The primary dataset was extracted as part of a service evaluation to assist local care planning. A fully
 101      anonymised dataset was created by a member of the Health Board NHS IT team. Prior to
 102      anonymisation, the postcode was used to extract the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD)
 103      for each patient, as obtained from https://wimd.gov.wales/. As such, ethical approval was not
 104      required for this study.
 105      Data fields including admission date, clinical outcomes, and laboratory measurements were
 106      integrated into an electronic healthcare registry “Cardiff Hospital Admissions Database” (CHAD)
 107      using a bespoke software package: CHADBuilder (see                 extended methods        ). Laboratory test results
 108      from the index presentation reported within the first 72 hours of ED presentation were considered
 109      as candidate variables.
 110      Outcomes
 111      28-day mortality was chosen as the primary endpoint in accordance with UK COVID-19 mortality
 112      reporting. To support generalisability between studies (4, 16) we performed secondary analysis
 113      using the composite endpoint of 28-day mortality or admission to intensive care.
 114      Laboratory testing panel
 115      All testing was performed in the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS)-accredited
 116      Biochemistry, Immunology, and Haematology Laboratories at the University Hospital of Wales. Cost
 117      estimates were obtained from the Health Board Laboratory Medicine Directorate, reflecting
 118      consumables, reagent, analyser running and maintenance costs, and staff time chargeable to NHS
 119      test requestors.
 120      Statistical analysis
 121      Statistical significance testing was performed according to the data encountered: for categorical
 122      data, such as gender, Fisher’s exact or chi-square testing was performed. For continuous data,
 123      Welch's t-tests were used if the assumptions of normality were met; otherwise non-parametric

 124      Mann-Whitney U tests were employed. In edge-cases, permutation testing was performed. Two-
 125      sided statistical significance was set at p <0.05, with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.
 126      Model development
 127      Candidate laboratory variables were triaged for inclusion based on their membership of core or
 128      extended laboratory test panels, before a data-driven approach was applied. This included
 129      assessment of variability, individual p-values corrected for multiple comparisons and multi-
 130      collinearity with generation of a Spearman's rank correlation matrix.
 131      Logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, and gradient boosted trees were all
 132      considered for multivariate predictive models. Models with complexity greater than logistic
 133      regression were found to offer little improvement (data not shown). Multivariate logistic regression
 134      was implemented in Python (version 3.7) using the Scikit-Learn package (version 0.23) (21) and
 135      Statsmodels (version 0.11). Complete case analysis was conducted to enable meaningful comparison
 136      between core and extended tests.
 137      To minimise bias, models were evaluated using cross-validation with 5-folds, with stratification to
 138      account for class imbalance. Performance statistics are reported as the average across all folds with
 139      binomial proportion 95% confidence intervals. Model discrimination was assessed by area under
 140      receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC), accuracy (balanced by support) and weighted F1
 141      score (the average F1 score was calculated for each class and weighted by support). In addition to
 142      these performance metrics, threshold-performance curves were generated to assess the effect of
 143      the decision threshold on model sensitivity and specificity (22). Source code for all models can be
 144      found on GitHub: https://github.com/burtonrj/CardiffCovidBiomarkers
 145      Our evaluation is reported using the transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for
 146      individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidance for Prediction Model development and
 147      validation (See Appendix).
 148      Patient involvement
 149      These data were generated as part of a rapid service improvement and as such patients were not
 150      involved in the setting of the research question or interpretation of the study.

 151      Results
 152      Definition and overview of service evaluation cohort
 153      We focused on admissions occurring after the operational roll-out of the first extended laboratory
 154      test panel components into standard clinical practice. During this 105 day period, over 13,500 ED
 155      attendances were recorded. Of these, 391 adults were admitted via ED with a laboratory-confirmed
 156      diagnosis of COVID-19 meeting our definition of likely community-acquired COVID-19 (Figure 1:
 157      Study Flowchart). The median age was 69 years (interquartile range, IQR: 55 - 75 years) with males
 158      predominant (52.4%). Within 28-days of index ED attendance, 113 deaths occurred (29% mortality),
 159      and 151 patients reached the composite secondary endpoint of intensive care admission/death
 160      (39%).
 161      Univariate analysis of laboratory predictors of adverse inpatient course
 162      We next analysed the association between individual candidate variables and patient outcomes to
 163      identify important predictors of adverse outcome. Admission clinical variables are presented in
 164      Table 1 (for full dataset, Supplementary S1&S2). Advanced age was strongly associated with
 165      increased risk of death and the composite of ICU admission and death. In contrast, neither gender
 166      nor socio-economic deprivation were associated with 28-day mortality. For laboratory variables,
 167      missing data were rare for core test panel components. Within the extended testing panel, hs-Trop
 168      and D-dimer were available in 70-80% of patients admitted with COVID-19 within the first 72 hours
 169      of ED attendance. An early admission PCT test result was available in 40% of patients, whilst ferritin
 170      and LDH levels were recorded in 42-46% of cases. Testing rates were similar between patient
 171      survival groups.
 172      In    univariate        analysis     of   the     core    laboratory    panel     components,     increased      CRP,
 173      neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, urea, creatinine; or decrease in serum albumin were all strongly
 174      associated with risk of death. Within the extended panel, D-dimer, hs-Trop and PCT differed
 175      between survivors and non-survivors on univariate analysis (Figure 2; Supplementary S3). No
 176      extended panel members were associated with development of the composite outcome
 177      (Supplementary S4&S5). Age was associated with several variables (Supplementary S6), indicating it
 178      could confound the relationship between a test result and mortality.
 179      Development of prognostic model based on core and extended laboratory admission test panels
 180      We therefore used multivariate logistic regression to adjust for the role of age, whilst controlling for
 181      gender and WIMD, based on consistent identification of their contribution to outcomes in COVID-19
 182      cohorts (23, 24). Restricting to cases with complete data (n=130) across core and extended
 183      laboratory tests, we found an optimal combination of core test variables to be CRP, albumin, urea,
 184      neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, creatinine, age, gender and WIMD (Figure 3, Supplementary S7). This

 185      gave a prognostic AUC of 0.79 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.67 to 0.91) for 28-day mortality, and
 186      0.70 (95% CI: 0.56 – 0.84) for the composite outcome.
 187      We next assessed the discriminative value associated with inclusion of extended panel components
 188      within our multivariate model, relative to this core test set (Figure 5). Addition of D-dimer resulted
 189      in a marginal increase in mean AUC score to 0.82, but this was not significantly different (95% CI:
 190      0.71 – 0.85) to the performance of core testing alone. Concerning the composite outcome, addition
 191      of admission hs-Trop to the core panel resulted in the greatest AUC score: 0.72 (95% CI: 0.60 to 0.83)
 192      but again, this did not represent a significant increase in performance to the core panel alone
 193      (Supplementary S7&S8). Consideration of extended test components individually or in combination
 194      did not improve upon this. To internally validate these findings, we performed stratified cross-
 195      validation, observing convergence of training and validation curves, thus suggesting a low-risk of
 196      over-fitting associated with these models (Supplementary S9&S10). Assessing the calibration of
 197      these models across a range of performance metrics by varying the decision threshold (the
 198      probability at which a patient is predicted to either die or be admitted to intensive care), we found
 199      no significant benefit from addition of the extended relative to the core laboratory testing panel
 200      (Supplementary S11&12).
 201
 202      Patterns of extended panel requesting during the first wave
 203      Local cost estimates for NHS requesting the core laboratory panel totalled £16.44 per patient, with
 204      an additional £55.48 incurred for the extended set (Supplementary S13). In order to contextualise
 205      testing beyond the cohort of community-acquired COVID-19, we constructed a run-chart of test
 206      requesting within the first 72 hours of admission via ED and COVID-19-related admissions (Figure 4).
 207      D-dimer and hs-Trop testing rates rose in line with COVID-19 admissions during March and April,
 208      with a 1-2 week delay apparent for LDH, ferritin, and PCT requesting. Strikingly, whilst COVID-19
 209      admissions declined following the April peak, the intensity of extended biomarker panel requesting
 210      remained. Using January and June 2020 to represent requesting patterns before and after the first
 211      wave of COVID-19, mean monthly requesting increased by 29.7%, 224%, and 588% for hs-Trop,
 212      ferritin, and LDH, respectively. In contrast, recorded monthly ED attendance fell by 24.0% over this
 213      period. PCT and quantitative D-dimer were specifically introduced in response to the pandemic, but
 214      still averaged >50 daily test requests within the early admission period during June. Across the
 215      evaluation period, over 6,400 D-dimer and 5,400 PCT requests were made, with an estimated service
 216      cost of £246,000.

 218      Discussion
 219      To support the effective and efficient use of resources through evidence-based clinical practice, we
 220      conducted a service evaluation determining the prognostic value associated with routinely
 221      performed laboratory investigation in 130 adults admitted with community acquired SARS-CoV-2
 222      infection. By leveraging a bespoke electronic healthcare registry, we reveal an extended panel
 223      (including D-dimer, LDH, hs-Trop, ferritin, PCT) provided only limited additional prognostic
 224      information beyond that provided by components of the core panel (FBC, U&E, LFT, and CRP).
 225      Together, this directs refinement of the clinical testing panel employed before and during future
 226      potential waves, underlining the relevance of this registry-approach to support cost-utility of
 227      investigation pathways.
 228      We identified 5 studies within the peer-reviewed and pre-print literature concerning laboratory
 229      biomarker risk stratification of adult COVID-19 admissions in the UK population (4, 16-19). The
 230      largest reported, an 8-point pragmatic risk score developed by the ISARIC Consortium, achieved a
 231      modest AUC performance score of 0.77 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.77) when predicting 28-day mortality (18).
 232      To date, only 1 UK study has considered the prognostic role of variables within our extended
 233      laboratory panel (16). In their prospective analysis of 155 patients, Arnold et al. found conventional
 234      laboratory biomarkers such as CRP and neutrophil elevation offered limited prognostic performance
 235      (with AUC scores of 0.52 and 0.54, respectively), whilst ferritin, PCT, hs-Trop, and LDH performed
 236      with AUC scores of 0.65 to 0.71. It is important to note that within this study cohort, the incidence of
 237      clinical deterioration was low (overall mortality was only 4% vs 29% for our service evaluation) which
 238      may have limited the power of the study (16). This highlights regional variation in rates of
 239      hospitalisation and mortality, and further motivated a locally-led assessment of practice.
 240      Consistent with the emerging COVID-19 literature, we observed an association between laboratory
 241      markers of acute phase inflammatory response (elevated neutrophil count, CRP; depressed
 242      lymphocytes and albumin), cardiac injury, activation of thrombosis, and renal impairment with
 243      subsequent adverse outcome (6, 23, 25). We found a combination of CRP, albumin, urea,
 244      neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, and creatinine alongside simple demographics achieved an AUC of 0.79
 245      (95% CI: 0.67 – 0.91) when predicting 28-day mortality, and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.56 – 0.84) for the
 246      composite endpoint. We found no evidence that use of this panel at admission significantly
 247      improved performance for either outcome. Importantly, we identified use of the extended
 248      laboratory panel continued despite falling rates of COVID-19 presentations, indicating a change in
 249      routine test requesting patterns. Addition of the extended laboratory test panel equates to £54 per
 250      patient (a relative cost increase of over 400% to the core panel alone), with significant cost
 251      ramifications when performed at scale.

 252      Our service evaluation has several strengths, notably assessment of the performance of an extended
 253      panel of laboratory tests not widely considered in UK prognostic studies to date (4, 16-19). These
 254      tests were integrated into routine practice prior to the local peak of the pandemic, based on
 255      available literature and national guidelines (15). In contrast with the batched analysis undertaken
 256      under research condition in previous studies (16), all tests described here were conducted by
 257      accredited laboratories using platforms calibrated to international reference standards, facilitating
 258      future data sharing. Our multivariate approach is well-suited to investigate whether specific
 259      laboratory tests provide additional prognostic value beyond conventional parameters (26), using
 260      inclusion criteria and clinically-relevant endpoints in line with other reported studies (4, 17, 18).
 261      Finally, we considered the service costs that accompanied implementing these tests into routine
 262      practice (27), a relevant factor often neglected in other publications.
 263      Our evaluation also has a number of limitations, reflecting the challenges of clinical data collection
 264      during an epidemic. It represents retrospective experience from a single tertiary referral centre,
 265      limiting sample size and the generalisability of our findings. Secondly, availability of extended test
 266      panel results during the early admission period was mixed. Admission D-dimer and hs-Trop results
 267      were available for 70-80% of patients, comparing favourably to a similar UK registry-based study
 268      where D-dimer results were only available at time of admission in 37.2% (17). Conversely, we
 269      observed high rates of missing data for LDH, ferritin, and PCT, undermining their relevance as a
 270      prognostic tool. This was likely due to operational factors such as a delay in test roll out relative to
 271      epidemic peak, and requirement for an additional sample tube. Because it cannot be assumed that
 272      data are missing at random, we chose to perform complete case analysis. Although this limits our
 273      statistical power, it avoids unfounded assumptions and potentially invalid imputation. In its current
 274      form, the CHAD-registry lacks detailed information on patient-level physiological observations,
 275      nature of co-morbidities, and therapeutic interventions. Similarly, all registry-linked laboratory
 276      values were available to clinicians, and are likely to have influenced management decisions. With
 277      advances in clinical care diagnostics, therapeutics are likely to alter the observed performance of the
 278      prognostic model. These limitations apply equally to pragmatic risk-scores (4, 16, 18). Finally, we
 279      recognise our evaluation consider the index test result and a specific question of inpatient prognosis,
 280      and additional indications exist for requesting components of the extended laboratory tests that fall
 281      outside of our primary and secondary endpoints. For instance, the use of PCT is often employed to
 282      support antibiotic stewardship (28), and was integrated into routine practice locally in early April
 283      2020. There may also be merit in more targeted use of additional testing particularly as therapeutic
 284      options evolve. Hence, whilst we highlight the significant associated healthcare costs with
 285      implementation of extended laboratory testing, we do not make specific claims concerning the
 286      potential savings from discontinuing unnecessary investigations (27).

 287      Implications for practice
 288      Laboratory markers supporting early risk stratification of patients are often used in the ED setting,
 289      and have been shown to benefit patient triage (29). Our data suggest that systematic testing of
 290      COVID-19-positive patients upon admission with an “extended” laboratory panel provide little
 291      additional prognostic information for COVID-19 mortality or intensive care admission “core” tests.
 292      Besides the financial impact, over-requesting of laboratory tests are likely to increase the number of
 293      false-positive results, with the potential to lead to further potentially harmful tests (e.g. computed
 294      tomography pulmonary angiography in patients with marginally elevated D-dimer but no clinical
 295      indication of thromboembolic disease) (30). We suggest that the use of these laboratory markers be
 296      targeted to patients with specific clinical indications for these, such as PCT to guide antibiotic
 297      prescription or hs-Trop in patients with suspected myocardial injury.
 298      In conclusion, we report our real-world experience from the use of an extended laboratory
 299      prognostic testing panel in patients hospitalised with community-acquired COVID-19. These findings
 300      directly inform clinical practice, guiding cost-efficient use of resources in potential future waves.

 333      Key Messages
 334
 335      During the first wave of the pandemic, the literature and guidance from the UK Royal College of
 336      Pathologists supported the use of extended biochemistry and haematology testing upon admission
 337      to support risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 infection- however the prognostic
 338      performance of these markers remains unclear.
 339
 340      Our service evaluation suggests that systematic testing of COVID-19-positive patients with likely
 341      community-acquired disease upon admission with an “extended” laboratory panel (high-sensitivity
 342      Troponin I, Ferritin, Lactate Dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, or quantitative D-dimer) provides limited
 343      additional prognostic information for 28-day mortality or intensive care admission, relative to
 344      conventional “core” tests such as a full blood count, renal function, C-reactive protein combined
 345      with simple demographics.
 346
 347      Few clinicians know the cost of the tests they request for their patients. With individual “extended”
 348      panel members costing over £20 per test, and thousands of tests requested per month within a
 349      single hospital, these costs quickly escalate.
 350
 351      Besides the financial impact, over-requesting of laboratory tests are likely to increase the number of
 352      false-positive results, with the potential to lead to further potentially harmful investigations (e.g.
 353      computed tomography pulmonary angiography in patients with marginally elevated D-dimer but no
 354      clinical indication of thromboembolic disease). We suggest that the use of these laboratory markers
 355      be targeted to patients with specific clinical indications for these, such as procalcitonin to guide
 356      antibiotic stewardship or hs-Troponin I in patients with suspected myocardial injury.
