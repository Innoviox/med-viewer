       Abstract:
       Background: COVID-19 disease (Coronavirus disease 2019) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute
       respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is widespread worldwide, affecting more than 11 million people
       globally (July 6th, 2020). Diagnostic techniques have been studied in order to contain the pandemic.
       Immunochromatographic (IC) assays are feasible and low cost alternative for monitoring the spread of
       COVID-19 in the population.
       Methods: Here we evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of eleven different immunochromatographic
       tests in 98 serum samples from confirmed cases of COVID-19 through RT-PCR and 100 negative
       serum samples from blood donors collected in February 2019. Considering the endemic situation of
       Dengue in Brazil, we also evaluated the cross-reactivity with Dengue using 20 serum samples from
       patients with confirmed diagnosis for Dengue collected in early 2019 through four different tests.
       Results: Our results demonstrated agreement between immunochromatographic assays and RT-PCR,
       especially after 10 days since the onset of symptoms. The evaluation of IgG and IgM antibodies
       combined demonstrated a strong level of agreement (0.85) of IC assays and RT-PCR. It was observed
       cross-reactivity between Dengue and COVID-19 using four different IC assays for COVID-19
       diagnosis. The specificity of IC assays to detected COVID-19 IgM antibodies using Dengue serum
       samples varied from 80% to 85%; the specificity of IgG detection was 100% and total antibody was
       95%.
       Conclusions: We found high sensitivity, specificity and good agreement of IC assays, especially after
       10 days onset of symptoms. However, we detected cross-reactivity between Dengue and COVID-19
       mainly with IgM antibodies demonstrating the need for better studies about diagnostic techniques for
       these diseases.

            1.    Introduction:
                  COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is a human infectious disease caused by a
       new betacoronavirus SARS-Cov-2 or 2019-nCoV (Severe acute respiratory syndrome
       coronavirus 2) firstly reported in China by flu-like symptoms (December 26th, 2019) and now
       widespread worldwide, affecting more than 11 million people globally according to World
       Health Organization (July 6th, 2020) [1–5].
                  The COVID-19 diagnosis is based on clinical and epidemiological features, image
       exams and finally the analysis of nucleic acids through reverse-transcription polymerase
       chain reaction (RT-PCR), established as the gold standard for COVID-19 disease [1,2,6].
       However, the accuracy of this method depends on the viral load on the collection site and on
       time from symptom onset. It presents limitations such as incorrect collection and processing
       of samples, the need of expensive equipment and reagents, trained operators and the delay
       in releasing the results [1,2,6,7].
                  The immunochromatographic (IC) assay is a feasible and low-cost alternative for
       monitoring the spread of COVID-19 in the population in general and specially in low and
       middle-income countries which lack of structure. Contact-tracing, population survey including
       health workers, teachers and students on resuming classes are situations that may be useful
       to use serology since the sensitivity of RT-PCR in asymptomatic is low and ranges from 8 to
       10% [1,2].
                  Likewise COVID-19, Dengue is also an emerging disease, especially in tropical and
       subtropical countries transmitted by Aedes mosquito, and both diseases are similar regarding
       clinical and laboratory features hampering the diagnosis [8–10]. Another matter is the
       temporal dynamic of both diseases in Brazil. The spread of Dengue usually increases
       between March and April due the rainy seasons, the same period when respiratory diseases
       are most common, and period in which the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases started to
       rise [10].
                   Despite the high number of IC assays available, the readiness to perform the
       diagnosis and advantages involving its use, here we evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of
       eleven different IC assays in serum samples from confirmed cases of COVID-19 through RT-
       PCR and negative serum samples from blood donors collected in February 2019. Considering
       the endemic situation of Dengue in Brazil, we also evaluated the cross-reactivity with Dengue
       using serum samples from patients with confirmed diagnosis for Dengue collected in early
       2019 through four different tests.
            2.    Methods:

       (HSL), a private 400-bed hospital. Both hospitals are located in Sao Paulo.
       2.2 Ethical approval
       This study was approved by the Brazilian national ethics review board (CONEP), protocol
       number 30701920200000068.
       2.3 Samples collection
                  The positive serum samples used in this study were collected in April at HSL and HC-
       FMUSP from 74 symptomatic patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis through RT-PCR,
       besides these 74 samples other 24 samples were collected from patients with more than 10
       days of symptoms, altogether 98 positive samples were used in this study. The serum
       samples were stored at -20 until the moment of test. In addition, 100 serum samples collected
       in February 2019 from blood donors at Fundação Pró-sangue – Hemocentro de São Paulo
       (São Paulo, Brazil) were used as negative controls for experiments, these samples were also
       stored at -20 until the moment of test. To evaluate the cross reactivity with Dengue we
       analyzed 20 samples collected from patients with confirmed diagnosis for Dengue by ELISA
       technique between February and March/2019.
       2.4 Immunochromatographic assays for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
                  In this study positive and negative samples from Brazilian subjects were evaluated
       through eleven qualitative IC assays performed according to manufacturer instructions
       summarized at table 1, using the following kits: One Step COVID-19 test (Wondfo, China –
       batch      W19500341);           SARS-COV-2            (COVID-19)       IgG/IgM      Antibody    Fast     Detection

       according to manufacturer instructions. In addition, 40 samples from COVID-19 confirmed
       cases were evaluated using PANBIO DENGUE IgM CAPTURE ELISA (Abbott, USA – batch
       01P20E014) in which 31 of them were collected after 10 days of symptoms. We also
       evaluated the cross-reactivity using IC assays for detection of antibodies against Dengue in
       33 samples of COVID-19 confirmed cases using ALERE DENGUE DUO-NS1 IgG and IgM
       (Abbott, USA – batch 11DDE008A-A and 11DDE007A-A).
       2.6 Statistical analysis
                  The validity of tests was measured through sensitivity (true positive / true positive +
       false negative = %) and specificity (true negative / true negative + false positive = %)
       calculations [11]. The concordance analysis was performed by the Fleiss’s Kappa method
       comparing the agreement between the gold standard (RT-PCR) and each one of the eleven-
       tested IC assays, the confidence interval was 95%.
            3.    Results:
                  Altogether 198 serum samples were collected for this study, among them, 98
       samples were collected from confirmed COVID-19 patients through RT-PCR, 74 of these
       patients’ samples were collected before the 10th day since the onset of symptoms and 24
       samples were collected after 10 days since the beginning of symptoms. In addition, as
       negative control were used 100 samples collected from blood donors on early 2019. The
       sensitivity and specificity as well as agreement ratio of eleven commercial qualitative IC
       assays were evaluated; the results were obtained through tests performed between May/2020
       and July/2020.
       3.1 Sensitivity of IC assay
                  A panel containing 74 positive samples and 100 negative samples was used to
       evaluate the sensibility of eleven IC tests. As summarized in table 2, among the tests, ten of
       them describe separately the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies and one of them Wondfo
       (China) evidence the presence of total immunoglobulins.
                  The greater sensitivity for detection of only IgG antibody among ten IC tests was
       observed in TBG (Taiwan) IC test at 93.3%, followed by Ecotest (Brazil) and Lepu (China) IC
       test at 90%, Bioclin (Brazil) at 81%, MedTest (China) and Thermogenesis (China) presented
       equivalent results (80%), followed by MedNet (China), Advagen (Brazil) and Luxus (China) at
       77.5%, 75.2% and 75% respectively. The Camtech (Singapore) presented the lower
       sensitivity among the tests at 70%.
                  The sensitivity for detection of only IgM antibody was also evaluated, the better result
       was achieve by MedTest (China) at 93.3%, followed by Ecotest (Brazil) and Lepu (China) at
       90%. The Camtech (Singapore) presented 87.5% of sensitivity while TBG (Taiwan),
       Thermogenesis (China) and MedNet (China) achieved identical sensitivities of 80%. Luxus
       (China) sensibility was 72.5% followed by Bioclin (Brazil) at 61% and finally Advagen (Brazil)

       at 35.5%. The evaluation of total immunoglobulins presented a sensitivity of 76.7% as
       observed in Wondfo test (China).
       3.2 Specificity of IC assay
                  The assay specificity was evaluated according to table 2. In IgG IC assays the
       specificity was equal (100%) in all the tests except for MedNet (China) at 97.5%. In the
       evaluation of IgM detection the assays sensitivity was 100% for Ecotest (Brazil), Lepu
       (China), Luxus (China), MedTest (China), TBG (Taiwan) and Thermogenesis (China). Bioclin
       (Brazil) achieve a specificity of 98%, followed by Camtech (Singapore) at 97.5%, Advagen
       (Brazil) at 96.7% and MedNet (China) at 95%. The evaluation of total immunoglobulins
       presented a specificity of 100% for Wondfo (China).
       3.3 Agreement rate
                  To evaluate the agreement among the testes and the gold standard RT-PCR we
       analyzed the Kappa’s value described in table 2, among the evaluated tests for detection of
       IgG antibody, four of them presented a strong agreement level: Lepu (China) 0.90, TBG
       (Taiwan) 0.84, Bioclin (Brazil) 0.82 and Thermogenesis (China) 0.80. Five tests presented a
       moderate agreement level MedTest (China) 0.76, Luxus (China) 0.75, Advagen (Brazil) 0.74,
       MedNet (China) 0.72 and Camtech (Singapore) 0.69. Finally, one presented a weak
       agreement level Ecotest (Brazil) 0.58.
                  The agreement of IgM detection tests was strong for four of evaluated tests: Lepu
       (China) 0.90, Camtech (Singapore) 0.85, MedTest (China) 0.83 and Thermogenesis (China)
       0.80. A moderate agreement was observed in three tests: TBG (Taiwan) 0.76, MedNet
       (China) 0.75 and Luxus (China) 0.72. A weak agreement was observed in two tests: Ecotest
       (Brazil) and Bioclin (Brazil) 0.58, followed by a minimal agreement Advagen (Brazil) 0.23. The
       evaluation of total immunoglobulins demonstrated a moderate agreement level of Wondfo
       (China) 0.78.
       3.4 Evaluation according to stage of disease
                  Considering the temporal dynamic of antibodies, we evaluated the sensitivity of tests
       in samples from patients collected more than 10 days after the onset of symptoms according
       to table 3. The sensitivity observed for IgG assays was 91.7% in MedNet (China) and 79.2%
       in Bioclin (Brazil) and a strong agreement level between these two tests and RT-PCR was
       note through Kappa value of 0.83. Evaluating the agreement ratio among MedNet (China)
       and RT PCR and Bioclin (Brazil) compared to RT-PCR the Kappa value of 0.87 and 0.79 was
       obtained respectively.
                  In IgM assays the MedNet (China) sensitivity was 91.7% while Bioclin (Brazil)
       sensitivity was 70.1%, the agreement ratio among these tests and RT-PCR was moderate
       Kappa value of 0.75, evaluating the agreement ratio between MedNet (China) and RT-PCR
       was obtained Kappa value of 0.83 and Bioclin (Brazil) presented a Kappa value of 0.66.

                  The evaluation of IgG and IgM antibodies combined demonstrated a strong level of
       agreement (0.85) of tests and RT-PCR results besides the sensitivity of 95.8%, 91.7% and
       83.3% for Wondfo (China), MedNet (China) and Bioclin (Brazil) respectively. An evaluation of
       agreement between IgG and IgM tests and RT-PCR demonstrated an almost perfect
       agreement ratio for Wondfo (China), kappa value of 0.92, followed by moderate agreement
       ratio of Bioclin (Brazil) and MedNet (China), kappa value 0.79.

                  Forty samples of COVID-19 confirmed cases were evaluated using tests for detection
       of antibodies against Dengue, the specificity of the ELISA PANBIO DENGUE CAPTURE
       ELISA (Abbott, USA) achieve 100% specificity. The IC assay ALERE DENGUE DUO-NS1
       IgG and IgM (Abbott, USA) demonstrated 100% specificity for both IgM and IgG antibodies
       using 33 samples of COVID-19 patients.
                  In the analyze of immunochrographic tests for COVID-19 diagnosis Advagen (Brazil)
       and Camtech (Singapore) reached 100% specificity for IgG antibody detection using 20
       dengue samples while MedNet (China) achieved 95%. In IgM detection the specificity was
       85% for Advagen (Brazil) and Camtech (Singapore), MedNet (China) reached 80% specificity
       while Wondfo specificity was 95% for detection of total antibodies as described in table 4.
            4.    Discussion:
                  In this study, we evaluated eleven IC colloidal-gold qualitative based assays and
       analyzed the quality measurements of each one of them. According to our results, most of IC
       assays provide high sensitivity and specificity compared to the gold standard RT-PCR,
       especially after 10 days since the onset of disease with an excellent agreement ratio
       compared to the gold standard using Wondfo test evaluating total antibodies against SARS-
       CoV-2.
                  The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the world health system in an unprecedented
       way. In Brazil the first reported case occurred on February 27th, 2020, since them more than 1
       million Brazilian people tested positive for COVID-19 [4,12]. Besides COVID-19, Brazil also
       faces an endemic situation regarding to Dengue, and considering the importance of both
       diseases, here we evaluated the cross-reactivity of Dengue and COVID-19 using different
       tests.
                  According to our results, the specificity in detection of IgG antibodies was greater in
       comparison with IgM detection using IC assays for detection of COVID-19 in Dengue patient’s
       samples. It is widely known that before the high-affinity response by IgG antibodies to
       pathogens the first defense provided by organism occurs through IgM molecules [13]. Our
       results suggest that the evaluation of total antibodies (IgG and IgM) is a useful tool to broaden
       the range of detection, enabling the evaluation of acute phase through IgM detection and
       convalescent phase by the presence of IgG. The evaluation of combined antibodies helps not

       only the discrimination of Dengue and COVID-19 but also avoid false negative results for
       COVID-19 and contributes to the establishment of control measures. On the other hand, the
       use of IC assays that detect IgM may have cross-reaction with Dengue and lead to a false
       positive result that might impact on the clinical management of the patient.
                  The IC assay is based on the detection of antibodies secreted by B lymphocytes
       against the viral pathogens using serum, plasma or whole blood samples from patients and a
       specific buffer on an immunochromatographic cassette [1,2,14,15]. The cassette is composed
       by plastic backing involving the strip where reaction occurs, sample pad for sample addition,
       conjugated pad containing antigens bound to colloidal nanoparticles, absorbent pad for waste
       reservoir, and the nitrocellulose membrane in which by capillary attraction the antigen-
       antibody reaction occurs, evidenced through a colored band (red color for colloidal-gold
       nanoparticles and blue color for colloidal selenium nanoparticles) in about 15 to 20 minutes
       [1,2,14,15].
                  Immunochromatographic is an easy and affordable method for diagnosis enabling
       prompt results in large scale. According to our results, the agreement ratio for detection of
       only IgG antibodies before the 10º day of symptom using IC technique in comparison with RT-
       PCR was moderate in the majority of used tests (50%), followed by strong agreement (40%)
       and weak agreement (10%). In contrast, for only IgM detection the agreement ratio between
       IC and RT-PCR was strong in the majority of tests (40%) followed by a moderate (30%), weak
       (20%) and minimal (10%) agreement. The evaluation of total antibodies using Wondfo test
       demonstrated better results using samples collected after the 10º day of symptoms (almost
       perfect agreement) than before this period (moderate agreement) compared to RT-PCR, the
       increase in sensitivity was also observed using MedNet test in samples after 10 days since
       the onset of symptoms.
                  In the literature, it is possible to find the detection of immunoglobulin on the 5 th day
       since the onset of disease. However, this detection is greater from the 8th day on [15]. Our
       results are in accordance with literature, demonstrating an increase in sensitivity levels
       especially using the combined assessment of IgG and IgM antibodies.
                  Our study has limitations such as sample size; however, to our knowledge it was the
       first study that analyzed several SARS-CoV-2 IC tests and cross-reaction with Dengue. Thus,
       our findings can be useful in countries with high prevalence of Dengue to alert to the possible
       cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 IC assays, mainly IgM, with Dengue antibodies.
             5.   Conclusion:
                  We found in general high sensitivity and specificity and good agreement of IC assays,
       especially after 10 days since the onset of symptoms. Our results also evidenced the
       importance in evaluating total immunoglobulins to increase sensitivity and specificity of IC
       assays. On the other hand, we detected cross-reactivity between Dengue and COVID-19
       demonstrating the need for better studies and improvements in diagnostic techniques for
       these diseases.

            6.    Limitations of the study:
                  In this study, a small number of samples was tested due to the availability of tests
       that we had at the beginning of COVID-19 in Brazil. Studies with more samples are needed to
       ensure validity of the results.
