   Abstract
   There is an urgent need in rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We
   have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) detecting IgM and
   IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in 10 minutes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance
   of this RDT. RT-PCR positive plasma samples (n=35) for SARS-CoV-2 and 97 negative control samples
   were studied. Diagnostic performance of IgG/IgM RDT was assessed using both gold standard RT-PCR
   and Electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total Ig. Overall,
   RDT sensitivity was 100% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 88-100%) and specificity 93% (95% CI:
   85-97%). This IgG/IgM RDT done in plasma displays a high diagnostic accuracy for SARS‐CoV‐2
   IgG/IgM in high COVID‐19 prevalence settings. Its use could be considered in the absence of routine
   diagnostic serology facilities for samples collected between 10 and 180 days after symptoms onset.

   Introduction
   SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of a several cases of pneumonia, first reported in Wuhan (Hubei,
   China), called 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). Protein sequence analysis of seven proteins has
   showed that the virus belongs to the species of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-
   CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with similar epidemiology1,2.
   Currently, the detection method for SARS-CoV-2 is based on viral RNA detection using Reverse
   Transcribed Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) but other tests such as chest computed tomography (CT)
   imaging or rapid antigen/antibody testing could be used3. Testing of specific antibodies of 2019-SARS-
   CoV-2 in patient blood is a good choice for rapid, simple, highly sensitive diagnosis of COVID-19.
   Moreover, Serological analysis indicates the exposure to the virus and if a patient has developed an
   immunity against the virus. It is widely accepted that IgM provides the first line of defense during viral
   infections, prior to the generation of adaptive, high affinity IgG responses that are important for long
   term immunity and immunological memory3. Several authors have analyzed the antibody kinetic in
   COVID-19 patients. Zhao et al. 2020, have shown that among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for
   total antibody, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively4.
   The seroconversion sequentially appeared for total antibody, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of
   11, 12 and 14 days after onset. The majority of antibodies are produced against the most abundant protein
   of the virus, which is the Nucleocapsid protein (NP). Therefore, tests that detect antibodies to NP would
   be the most sensitive. However, the receptor-binding domain of Spike protein (RBD-S) is the host
   attachment protein, and antibodies to RBD-S would be more specific and are expected to be neutralizing.
   Therefore, according to authors, using one or both antigens would result in high sensitivity5. Moreover,
   the source of protein (prokaryotic vs eukaryotic) as well as the region of the protein (RBD, full-length)
   and the tag used (His tag or Fc Tag) is a major concern in the diagnostic performance6.
   The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate the performance of a new IgM/IgG rapid diagnostic test
   (RDT) based on lateral flow assay (LFA) technology, in a high COVID-19 prevalence setting using gold
   standard RT-PCR as well as an Electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) Elecsys® Anti-
   SARS-CoV-2 total Ig (Roche, Switzerland).

   Material & Methods
   Preparation of rapid test IgM/IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2
   Anti-human IgM was purchased from Hybridoma Reagent Laboratory Inc. (Baltimore, USA) and
   protein G from ThermoFisher Scientific Inc. (USA), COVID-19 recombinant Receptor Binding Domain
   antigen was purchased from GenScript Biotech (Netherlands) B.V. (Leiden, NL). Several different
   designs of antigen were tested and optimized. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and sucrose were purchased
   from Sigma, BSA-biotinylated from Vector Laboratories Inc. (Burlingame, USA) and purified
   streptavidin from BioLegend Inc. (San Diego, USA). 80 nm gold nanoparticle (AuNP) colloids was
   purchased from nanoComposix Inc. (San Diego, USA), nitrocellulose membrane backed on plastic
   support were obtained from Merck Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany), the glass fiber conjugate pad,
   sample pad and absorbent pad were obtained from Ahlstrom-Munksjö (Helsinki, Finland). To prepare
   the AuNP conjugate, SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein was added to AuNP colloid according to
   manufacturer protocol. Similarly, the control line AuNP colloid was produced using Streptavidin. The
   test strip consists of four parts, including nitrocellulose backed on plastic support, sample pad, conjugate
   pad and absorbent pad. The anti-human IgM, protein G and BSA-biotin were immobilized at test line
   M, G and control line (C line), respectively. Conjugate pad was sprayed with mixture of AuNP-COVID-
   19 recombinant antigen conjugate and AuNP-streptavidin. Test strip were then placed in a plastic
   housing cassette and sealed in aluminum pouch with a desiccant (figure 1). The test has been developed
   and produced by GaDia SA (Monthey, Switzerland).
   Sample Testing
   The pouched test was opened immediately before use. To perform the test, 10 µL of plasma sample was
   pipetted into the sample area followed by adding 2-3 drops (60-70 µL) of running buffer (PBS + 1%
   tween 20 + 1% BSA). The result is interpreted after 10 minutes. Three detection lines are on the stip.
   The control (C) line appears when sample has flowed through the strip. The presence of anti- SARS-
   CoV-2 IgM and/or anti- SARS- CoV-2 IgG will be indicated by a red line in the M and/or G region. If
   only the control line (C) appear, the sample does not contain IgM nor IgG antibodies. If the control line
   does not appear, the test is invalid, and the test should be repeated (figure 1).
   Study population and blood sample collection
   Anonymized leftovers of diagnostic specimen plasma-EDTA, supplied by INO Specimens BioBank,
   ISB (Clermont-Ferrand, France), were used for the evaluation. All 35 positive samples used have a day
   post symptom (DPS) of at least 10 days and were positive for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR (BD SARS-
   CoV-2 reagent kit for the BD Max system; Becton Dickinson and Co, US). Additional serological
   analysis was used for 11 out of 35 RT-PCR positive samples using Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total
   Ig (Roche, Switzerland). All analyses were conducted by INO Specimens BioBank. Unmatched healthy

   plasma samples (n=97), supplied by AbBaltis (Kent, UK) with a collection date before 2018, were used
   as negative control group.
   Electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total Ig
   Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total Ig (Roche, Switzerland) uses the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-
   CoV-2 as antigen. Total Ig was analyzed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The assays were
   run on Cobas e 601 (Roche, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Positivity is defined
   by manufacturer as cut-off index (COI) ≥ 1.0.
   Statistics
   Vassarstats online tool (www.vassarstats.net) was used to calculate sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP),
   positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV), 95% confidence intervals, median, and
   Interquartile range (IQR); while significance (p-values) was calculated using Mann-Whitney U test for
   categorical variables. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.
   Results
   Rapid test development
   The SARS‐CoV‐2 rapid IgM/IgG antibody test is a lateral flow qualitative immunoassay for the rapid
   determination of the presence or absence of both anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2‐IgM and anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2‐IgG in
   human specimens. The test strip has three detection lines, including a control line that appears when the
   sample has flowed to the end of the strip. The presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG and IgM antibodies are
   indicated by a red line in the specific region indicated on the device (M line or G line). When IgM or
   IgG are present in the sample, they bind to SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain Antigen coated on
   gold Nanoparticles. Then this complex antibody-antigen-gold Nanoparticles flows through the device.
   The anti‐ SARS‐CoV‐2 IgM antibodies will bind to the M (IgM) line, and the IgG antibodies will bind
   to the G (IgG) line. If the specimen does not contain SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies, no labeled complexes
   bind at the test zone and no M or G lines are observed. The remaining colloidal gold flows up to the
   control line, where streptavidin gold nanoparticles will bind to BSA-biotin. A red line must appear at
   the control line zone for all valid tests whether the sample is positive or negative for SARS‐CoV‐2
   antibody (figure 1).

   Baseline characteristics
   The baseline demographic characteristics of patients samples were as follows: the 35 RT-PCR
   confirmed COVID-19 samples from patients were older (median 50 years old, IQR 34.5-60.5) compared
   to the healthy plasma samples patients (n=97) (median 33.5 years old, IQR 19-43; p<0.0001). The
   proportion of females in COVID-19 cohort was 54% (n=19) and 56% (n=54) in healthy control group
   Among COVID-19 samples, the median delay between symptoms onset and sampling was 21 days (IQR
   16-32 days), but not less than 10 days. The longest DPS for one single sample was 180 days. All RT-
   PCR tests were done in nasopharyngeal secretions. The median CT value was 25.6 (IQR 20.05-29.15).
   Electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total Ig (Roche,
   Switzerland) was conducted on 11 out of 35 RT-PCR confirmed samples. The median cut-off index
   (COI) was 49.1 (IQR 7.5-103.2 COI).
   Specificity of IgG/IgM RDT on negative control group
   IgG/IgM RDT diagnostic specificity against negative control group with a sampling date before 2018
   (n=97) is shown in Table 1. IgG/IgM RDT revealed concordant results in 90 of 97 samples. Seven

   discordant results showed positive results for IgM line only, while being negative (collection date before
   the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak) (false-positives). These resulted in an IgG/IgM RDT specificity
   (SP) of 93% (95% CI: 85-97%). When considering only IgG line results, the specificity was 100% (95%
   CI: 95-100%).
   Sensitivity of IgG/IgM RDT against RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 samples
   IgG/IgM RDT diagnostic sensitivity against RT-PCR confirmed samples (n=35) is shown in Table 1.
   All RT-PCR confirmed samples were positive either for IgG or IgM or both. These resulted in an
   IgG/IgM RDT sensitivity (SE) of 100% (95% CI: 88-100%), while the PPV was 83% (95% CI: 68-
   92%) and the NPV 100% (95% CI: 95-100), in this unmatched case-control study, compared to RT-
   PCR confirmed samples. Two samples with days post symptoms (DPS) of respectively 170 and 180
   days were still positive for IgG and/or IgM (Supl. Material).

   The table 2 compares the results obtained with total Ig ECLIA and the developed rapid test (RDT). A
   positive ECLIA result is characterized by a Cut-off index value (COI) of > 1.10. The analytical
   sensitivity of the rapid test is similar to the ECLIA, with low positive samples (COI = 1.19) the rapid
   test is positive for IgM only, indicating a probable early infection (DPS = 10).
   Discussion
   The key finding of the present evaluation study, using an unmatched case-control design including
   73.5% of negative control samples, is that the diagnostic accuracy of IgG/IgM RDT on plasma samples
   when compared to RT-PCR or ECLIA is the same and displayed a SE of 100%, a SP of 93% and a NPV
   of 100%. When compared to ECLIA, positive predictive value is of 61% and 83% when compared to
   RT-PCR due to prevalence.
   No false-negatives result was obtained with this RDT, compared to ECLIA values, indicating that even
   with borderline samples (Cut-of index of 1.19), the test is positive. ECLIA Manufacturer defined
   positive samples when Cut-of index (COI) value is ≥ 1.0. This finding indicates that the analytical
   sensitivity of this newly developed RDT is similar than the ECLIA Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total
   Ig (Roche, Switzerland), even if the ECLIA is targeting the immune response against full-length N
   protein of SARS-CoV-2 and our RDT the immune response against RBD of spike protein.
   Such performances indicate that this RDT could be fit for purpose in clinical settings where a high
   prevalence of COVID-19 prevails, especially in situations where ECLIA are not available, or cannot be
   reliably used. Diagnostic performances in low prevalence populations still needs to be determined and
   larger populations need to be tested. In addition, it is clear that serological assay for SARS-CoV-2
   antibodies need to be performed at least 10 to 15 days after symptoms onset7,8. Finally, here we used
   plasma and the test was performed in a laboratory environment; we may expect different results in real-
   life at patients’ bed and using capillary blood.
   The second notable finding of this study lies in the fact that IgG and IgM seropositivity is still present
   180 days after symptoms onset even with normal antibody decline9. To our knowledge, it is the first
   time that SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM seropositivity is demonstrated with RDT 180 DPS. This study
   indicates also that SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM are present constantly and with enough concentration to be
   detectable with RDT, from 15 days to at least 180 days post symptoms. This finding applies to the this
   RDT only and must not be applied to other RDTs currently available. It is also necessary to
   quantitatively determine the level of IgG/IgM 180 days after symptoms onset to confirm this finding
   obtained with a qualitative assay.

   In addition, the test provided clear results, without indeterminate or invalid results (no Control line).
   There are several limitations to this study. First, we present here the results of a method evaluation study
   and not a seroprevalence study. Therefore, the PPV obtained here (based on a 26.5% proportion of cases
   defined as laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR) will probably be lower in a low prevalence
   setting. Nevertheless, our results also showed that when targeting a population 10 days after symptoms
   onset, sensitivity and NPV reach high diagnostic performances (100%). Although not fully established
   here, we observed that the RDT results were consistent with the other automated serological test
   (ECLIA) with similar analytical sensitivity. Another limitation of this validation study lies in its limited
   sample size leading to broad 95% confidence intervals, requiring confirmation of these data at a larger
   scale. Finally, our present conclusions only apply to this RDT, and must not be applied to any other
   RDTs currently available.
   In conclusion, this RDT is not meant to replace a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR diagnostic test in the first week
   of the disease, but could be a reliable option for assessing the SARS-CoV-2 serology in moderate to
   high COVID-19 prevalence settings, especially in situations where automated ECLIA or ELISA are not
   available, with samples collected at least 10 days after symptoms onset and up to 180 days after the
   onset of symptoms. Further investigations in low prevalence situations and using capillary blood are
   necessary.
