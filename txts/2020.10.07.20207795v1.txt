  High seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among people living in precarious situations in Ile de France, Oct 2020
  care in several of these locations in Paris and in Seine-Saint-Denis, one of its suburbs, between March
  and June 2020. A seroprevalence survey was conducted to assess the level of exposure to COVID-19
  among the population living in the sites. To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of the impact
  of the pandemic on populations living in insecure conditions in Europe.
  Methods
  We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in the food distribution sites, emergency
  shelters and workers residences supported by MSF in Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis, to determine the
  extent of COVID-19 exposure as determined by SARS-CoV2 antibody seropositivity. The detection of
  SARS-COV2 antibodies in serum was performed at the Institut Pasteur of Paris using two LuLISA
  (Luciferase-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) assays and a Pseudo Neutralization Test. A questionnaire
  covering sociodemographic characteristics, living conditions, adherence to sanitary recommendations
  and symptom manifestations was also completed. We describe here the seroprevalence site by site
  and identify the risk factors for seropositivity using a multivariable logistic regression model with site
  random effects. We also investigated associations between seropositivity and symptoms eventually
  reported.
  Findings
  Overall, 426/818 individuals tested positive in the 14 sites investigated. Seroprevalence varied
  significantly with the type of site (chi² p<0.001). It was highest at 88.7% (95%CI 81.8-93.2) among
  individuals living in workers’ residences, followed by 50.5% (95%CI 46.3-54.7) in emergency shelters
  and 27.8 % (95%CI 20.8-35.7) among individuals recruited from the food distribution sites.
  Seroprevalence also varied significantly between sites of the same type. Among other risk factors, the
  odds for seropositivity were higher among individuals living in crowded sites (medium: adj. OR 2.7,
  95%CI 1.5-5.1, p=0.001; high: adj. OR 3.4, 95%CI 1.7-6.9, p<0.001) compared with individuals from low
  crowding sites and among those who reported transit accommodation in a gymnasium before the
  lockdown (adj. OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.2-8.1, p=0.023). More than two-thirds of the seropositive individuals
  (68.3%; 95%CI 64.2-72.2) did not report any symptoms during the recall period.
  Interpretation
  The results demonstrate rather high exposure to SARS-COV-2 with important variations between study
  sites. Living in crowded conditions was identified as the most important explanatory factor for
  differences in levels of exposure. This study describes the key factors which determine the risk of
  exposure and illustrates the importance of identifying populations at high risk of exposure in order to
  orient and adapt prevention and control strategies to their specific needs.

  High seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among people living in precarious situations in Ile de France, Oct 2020
  Introduction
  A novel coronavirus causing a severe respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), emerged at the end of 2019 in Hubei province, China and then spread
  worldwide (1). Following this, Europe became the major hotspot of the global pandemic (1) and the
  first confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were detected in France by 24
  January 2020 (2). As a response to an exponential transmission rate, with hospitalizations and deaths
  doubling every two to three days, a nationwide lockdown was implemented on the 17th of March
  2020. Although the lockdown applied to the entire country, important differences were observed
  between regions in terms of number of confirmed cases reported and deaths. Although the final
  number of infections is yet to be established in France, a model-based study estimated a nationwide
  infection rate of 6% in France during the first wave, ranging from 1.5% infected in Nouvelle Aquitaine
  to 12% in Ile-de-France (IDF) (3). A recent seroprevalence study reported similar estimates: 10% in IDF
  and 3.1% in Nouvelle Aquitaine.(4)
  Heterogeneity in the risk of exposure to COVID-19 likely exists among different subpopulations.
  Specific subgroups such as health care professionals or nursing home employees and residents have
  already been identified as groups at higher risk of exposure than the general population (5-8). It is likely
  that other populations have suffered higher exposure risks to COVID-19 because of their working (9,10)
  or living conditions (i.e.: shared housing). In France, an estimated 900,000 people lack a permanent
  housing, with an estimated 250,000 people experiencing recurrent homelessness, including up to
  50,000 in Ile-de-France. It has been estimated that at least 3,500 people are homeless on the streets
  of Paris and close to 7,000 in the Ile-de-France (11,12). People experiencing homelessness or otherwise
  living in precarious conditions may be particularly vulnerable to exposure to COVID-19. Shared
  housing, including shelters and encampments, and poor sanitary conditions are factors that can
  potentially expedite virus transmission. Many of the recommended COVID-19 prevention measures,
  such as social-distancing and self-isolation if symptomatic, may be challenging or not feasible for a
  population living under these circumstances. In addition, people experiencing homelessness include
  older adults who may have underlying medical conditions with higher risks of developing severe
  COVID-related illness (13,14).
  During the nationwide lockdown in France, known as “confinement”, French authorities relocated
  people experiencing homelessness into emergency shelters, including hotels and large venues, such as
  gymnasiums. Non-governmental organisations and associations filled several resulting gaps in this
  relocation, including medical care. Between March and June 2020, the non-profit medical
  humanitarian organization Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) provided medical care and hygiene
                                                                                                                                3

  High seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among people living in precarious situations in Ile de France, Oct 2020
  promotion to populations living in workers’ residences and emergency shelters, in Ile-de-France (IDF).
  Mobile clinic activities included clinical management of non-COVID cases, with hospital referrals when
  needed, COVID screening, and referrals to COVID isolation centres when necessary. The MSF mobile
  clinics performed some sample collection for PCR-based COVID assays but many individuals with mild
  symptoms compatible with COVID were never tested and the actual rate of infection among the
  homeless population in France remains unknown.
  Given the variable access to testing, and potentially the substantial proportion of asymptomatic cases
  who did not seek such tests, the number of confirmed cases of positive PCR assays does not reflect the
  true impact of the pandemic. Serological-based assays can accurately identify the number of people
  exposed to the virus (16) but although several serological/seroprevalence studies have been
  undertaken nation-wide, few have focused on populations experiencing homelessness (3,14,15).
  Recommendations from the National Health Authority (Haute Autorité de Santé) have underscored
  the need for more serological surveys in specific populations, including among vulnerable groups, to
  evaluate the overall exposure to the virus, raise awareness and improve preparation for the rebound
  in COVID-19 cases (16), currently observed (17). This survey was conducted to assess the level of
  exposure to COVID-19 among the population living in sites served by MSF in IDF. To our knowledge,
  this is the first survey to assess the pandemic’s impact on vulnerable populations in Europe.
  Methods
  Survey design and sampling strategy
  We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in sites supported by MSF in Paris and Seine-
  Saint-Denis, two urban departments of Ile de France region, to determine the extent of COVID-19
  infection among the population residing in or frequenting these sites, as determined by SARS-CoV2
  antibody seropositivity.
  A target sample size of 791 individuals was based on the hypothesis that the seroprevalence of anti-
  SARS-COV2 antibodies among populations living in insecure conditions served by MSF would be two
  to three fold higher than the modelled estimate for the general population in IDF of 12% (3).
  Recruitment sites were identified among the 39 MSF intervention sites based on feasibility of
  conducting the survey, i.e. whether the sites were still open at the time of survey, security constraints
  and the sites managers’ agreement. The number of people per site was calculated in proportion to
  each of the expected site’s population. Training of surveyors and translators was conducted for two
  days before the initiation of the study. Individuals were randomly selected for participation at each
  site, using simple random sampling when a listing of residents existed and systematic random sampling
                                                                                                                                4

  otherwise. To increase participation of those initially selected to participate, sites were visited several
  times at different times of the day, including on weekends and evenings. In case of refusal or absence,
  the initially selected person was replaced by the next person in line or another adult sharing the room.
  After obtaining written informed consent from the participant, a questionnaire was completed face-
  to-face by a trained interviewer in the participant's language (for French, English, Arabic, Farsi, Spanish
  and Portuguese interviews were conducted in person and other languages using a translator by
  telephone).
  Responses were recorded electronically via a Kobo Collect form on a cell phone or tablet. The data
  were analysed using Stata V.15 software (StataCorp. 2017. College Station, TX) and R (R 3.6.2).
  Blood samples were collected on site from each participant, transported and processed within 24
  hours for testing.
  Laboratory Procedures
  The serology assays for the detection of SARS-COV2 antibodies were performed using the LuLISA
  (Luciferase-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) technology designed by Institut Pasteur, Paris (18). The
  LuLISA uses the nucleoproteins (N) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or the Spike (S) protein as target antigens
  for the detection of specific IgG antibodies in human serum using a variable domain of the IgG single
  heavy chain from immunized alpaca, specific for human IgG constant domain, expressed as a tandem
  with a luciferase, NanoKAZ (19). In the presence of luciferase substrate, hikarazine-Q108, the
  luminescence intensity (relative light unit/s) yielded by luciferase catalytic activity is related to the
  number of target-bound IgG (19, 20). In addition to LuLISA (N), and LuLISA (S), a Pseudo Neutralization
  Test (PNT) was performed to confirm the presence of antibodies and to assess their potential to
  neutralise and protect against the SARS-COV-2 virus.
  The LuLISA technique can be used to assess the incidence of all the antibodies involved in a viral
  infection response (IgA, IgM and, as used here, IgG) and is considered highly sensitive. The incidence
  of IgG in patients with a COVID-19 positive PCR test sampled 15 days after onset of symptoms is 100%
  (21). The specificity of the LuLISA varied between 97 and 100% in another recent evaluation (21).
  The LuLISA and PNT results are expressed in relative light units per second (RLU/s) because they are
  bioluminescence-based. Positivity for LULISA assays is defined by a cut-off eliminating at least 98% of
  pre-pandemic samples (10,291 RLU/s). The pseudo-neutralisation positivity threshold is defined by a
  cut-off corresponding to 3 times the standard deviation measured with the same technique on pre-
  pandemic sera (28,532 RLU/s). We considered an individual seropositive if at least one of the 3 tests
  (LuLISA N, LuLISA S or PNT) gave a positive result.
                                                                                                                                5

  High seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among people living in precarious situations in Ile de France, Oct 2020
  Statistical Analysis
  We describe the study participants using summary measures and estimated the seroprevalence and
  95% confidence intervals (95%CI) by site, type of site, and characteristics of participants using the
  Clopper–Pearson method. A sensitivity analysis of seroprevalence estimates by type of sites, taking
  into account assumptions about diagnostic test performances, is presented in the supplementary
  material.
  To investigate seropositivity risk factors, we first performed univariable logistic regression analysis by
  type of site and for all sites combined. We subsequently constructed a multivariable logistic regression
  model with random intercepts for specific sites of recruitment to account for clustering of individuals.
  In the multivariable model selection, we included variables with the potential to epidemiologically
  explain the differences in seropositivity incidence. We first grouped variables into four categories: (i)
  sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, working before lockdown, language barrier), (ii) frequency
  of leaving the place of residence during the lockdown (for work, cultural activities, use of public
  transport, time spent outside), (iii) crowding in the place of residence (number sharing room, number
  sharing sanitary facilities, number sharing kitchen, and number of contacts inside place of residence
  per day), and (iv) adhering to hygiene recommendations (hand washing, wearing masks, distancing,
  cleaning, and following recommendations in general).
  For sociodemographic characteristics and adherence to hygiene recommendations, we selected
  variables from each category that were most strongly associated with seropositivity. To investigate
  associations of seropositivity with population density in a residence, we created a cumulative crowding
  indicator, based on the sum of the levels of each of the 4 questions summarizing the crowding
  information for sharing (i) the bedroom, (ii) the shower, (iii) the kitchen, and (iv) the number of close
  contacts (>15 minutes per day closer than 1 meter). This made it possible to categorize low, medium,
  and high levels of crowding (see Supplementary material for more details on how the composite
  crowding indicator was calculated).
  We also constructed a similar score for the frequency of leaving place of residence, combining the
  answers to the questions 'Gone out to go to work', 'Gone out to go to a distribution/association/church
  site...' and 'Took public transport' into 3 categories: those who never went out, those who
  rarely/sometimes went out, and those who went out frequently (every day).
  Other variables investigated were: tobacco use, awareness of close contact with a COVID case(s),
  transit through a gymnasium at the beginning of the confinement (as an indicator for exposure to
  crowding before moving to a specific site), and the type of site. We then performed backwards variable
                                                                                                                                6

  Ethical considerations
  This protocol was approved by the MSF ethics review board on 18 June 2020, reference number 2044)
  and by the Comité de Protection des Personnes (CPP), Ile de France, Paris XI, approved 19 June 2020
  (reference number 20050-62628).
  Results
  Between 23 June and 2 July 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study among 829
  people living in 14 facilities: 2 food distribution sites, 2 workers' residences and 10 emergency shelters.
  Depending on the site, between 1 in 10 and one third of participants randomly selected for
  participation were replaced with another participant from the same site, due to absence or refusal.
  After cleaning the data and consolidating the results, 818 people were included in all the sites and
  received their serological results for these SARS-COV-2 assays.
  Characteristics of study participants
  Overall, 79.6% (95%CI 76.7-82.3) of study participants were male with an overall sex ratio of 3.9. There
  were no females present in the workers’ residences. The mean age of participants was 39 years, with
  49.0% (95%CI 45.5-52.5) of the population younger than 35 years; the population recruited from food
  distribution sites was older on average than the one living in shelters (mean age=31.8 vs 49.0; p=0.001).
  Comorbidities were reported for 20.8% (95%CI% 18.1-23.7) of participants; the most commonly
  reported health problems were hypertension (8.3%; 95%CI 6.5-10.4) and diabetes (5.6%; 95%CI 4.1-
  7.4). More than half of the surveyed population reported never smoking (54.1%; 50.6-57.6).
  Participants recruited from food distribution sites resided in different types of housing: 18.2% (95%CI
  6.4-41.8) in their own residence, 40.9% (95%CI 21.6-63.5) in shelters (emergency or other) and 36.3%
  (95%CI 18.2-59.4) in the streets or in a camp.
  The majority of participants (90.7%, 95%CI 88.5-92.6) were not born in France, and almost a quarter
  of all participants (22.7%; 95%CI 19.9-25.8) had been residing in France for less than a year. Two-thirds
  (68.1%; 95%CI 64.8-71.3) of participants reported having medical coverage (French national social
  security or French state medical aid); 64.3% (95%CI 60.9-67.6) reported an education level up to middle
  school. Overall, most participants were not working before the lockdown (77.5 % [74.4-80.3]), with the
  exception of participants from the workers’ residences, 59.7 % (9%CI 50.5-68.4] of whom reported a
  professional activity before the lockdown.

  Living conditions varied by site type. Workers’ residences were more crowded than the other types,
  where one third (33.6%, 95%CI 25.3-42.7) of participants reported sharing a room with 2-5 other
  individuals and 21.3% (95%CI 14.4-29.6) with more than five individuals. Among participants from
  emergency shelters, 59.3% (95%CI 55.0-63.6) shared a room with one other person but rarely with
  more than five individuals (4%, 95%CI 2.5-6.1), while nearly half (47.8%, 95%CI 39.2-56.5) of
  participants recruited from food distribution sites did not share accommodation with anyone.
  Seroprevalence
  Overall, 426/818 individuals tested positive by any serological test. Seroprevalence varied significantly
  by type of site (chi² p<0.001) (Figure 1). It was highest at 88.7% (95%CI 81.8-93.2) among individuals
  living in the two workers’ residences, followed by 50.5 % (95%CI 46.3-54.7) in the 10 emergency
  shelters and 27.8 % (95%CI 20.8-35.7) among individuals recruited from the two food distribution sites.
  Seroprevalence also varied between facilities of the same type: 23-62% in emergency shelters, 18-35%
  in food distribution sites and 82-94% in workers’ residences.
  The pseudo-neutralization test was positive for 303 out of the 818 individuals. This assay suggests that
  the seropositive population could therefore be protected against COVID-19 infection, at least at the
  time of the sample survey (supplementary materials, Table S1).
  Correlations and concordance between the three serology techniques were found to be strong
  (supplementary materials Figure S2-3 and Table S1).
  Risk factors
  In univariable analysis, the most strongly associated risk factors of seropositivity were those linked to
  crowded living conditions. The odds of seropositivity was 4.3 times (95%CI 2.2-8.4, p<0.001) higher
  among individuals sharing a room with more than five individuals compared to those not sharing a
  room; and 3.1 (95%CI 2.0-5.0, p<0.001) times higher among individuals sharing sanitary facilities with
  more than five individuals compared to those not sharing facilities (Table 1). The odds of seropositivity
  increased with the level of crowding with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.6 (95%CI 2.0-6.3; p<0.001) for medium
  and an OR of 6.7 (95%CI 3.6-12.5; p<0.001) for high crowding compared to individuals with a low
  crowding composite indicator.
  The odds of seropositivity were higher among participants who reported transiting in a gymnasium
  during the lockdown compared to those who did not (OR 2.8; 95%CI 1.1-7.2; p=0.03). There was no
  significant difference in seropositivity between individuals who were aware of COVID cases among
  their close contacts and those who were not aware (OR 1.2; 95%CI 0.8-1.8, p=0.41). The main factor
  associated with a reduction of exposure to the virus was the frequency of leaving the place of
                                                                                                                                8

  residence: the odds of seropositivity were significantly lower among individuals who left the residence
  sometimes (OR 0.6, 95%CI 0.4-0.8, p=0.001) or who left the residence nearly every day (OR 0.4, 95%CI
  0.2-0.6, p<0.001) compared to those who reported never leaving the residence during the lockdown
  period. The odds of seropositivity were also lower among individuals who reported regular
  consumption of tobacco compared to those who reported to have never smoked (OR 0.5, 95%CI 0.3-
  0.6). However, individuals who reported having adhered to hygiene recommendations most of the
  time did not have lower odds of seropositivity compared to those who reported not following the
  recommendations (OR 1.3; 95%CI 0.8-2.1, p=0.27).
  In multivariable analysis, the odds of seropositivity remained higher among individuals who lived in
  more crowded sites (medium: adj. OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.5-5.1, p=0.002; high: adj. OR 3.4, 95%CI 1.7-6.9,
  p<0.001; compared to individuals with low crowding composite indicators) and those who reported
  transit through a gymnasium during the lockdown (adj. OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.2-8.1, p<0.001) (Table 2). The
  association with site type also remained significant, where the odds of seropositivity was 12.0 (adj. OR,
  95%CI 5.6-25.6, p<0.001) times higher among individuals from workers’ residences, and 1.7 (adj. OR,
  95%CI 1.1-2.7, p=0.025) times higher among individuals from emergency shelters compared to those
  recruited from food distribution sites. The odds of seropositivity decreased with frequency of leaving
  the place of residence (left sometimes: adj. OR 0.6, 95%CI 0.4-0.8, p=0.003; left nearly every day: adj.
  OR 0.4, 95%CI 0.2-0.7, p<0.001; compared to those reporting never leaving the place of residence).
  Moreover, the odds of seropositivity was lower among regular smokers compared to those who never
  smoked (adj. OR 0.4, 95%CI 0.3-0.7, p<0.001) and among female than male participants (adj. OR 0.5,
  95%CI 0.4-0.8, p=0.01).
  Symptoms
  More than two-thirds of seropositive individuals (68.3%; 95%CI 64.2-72.2) did not report any
  symptoms during the recall period since 1 March (implying a high proportion of asymptomatic
  infections). In contrast, 50.2% (95%CI 46.0-54.3) of individuals who did not report symptoms were
  found to be seropositive. While not statistically significant, there was a trend in association between
  the report of symptoms associated with COVID and seropositivity: people who were seropositive had
  a 30% higher odds of reporting symptoms than those who were not (OR 1.3, 95%CI 1.0-1.8, p=0.09).
  Among the investigated symptoms, six of the twelve reported symptoms were found significantly
  associated with seropositivity when comparing individuals with severe versus mild or no symptoms
  (Figure 2), including loss of taste (OR 6.6, 95%CI 2.3-18.9, p<0.001), fever (OR 4.3, 95%CI 2.3-7.8,
  p<0.001), loss of smell (OR 4.0, 95%CI 1.6-9.9, p=0.003), shivering (OR 3.2, 95%CI 1.5-7.2, p=0.004),
  fatigue (OR 2.3, 95%CI 1.3-4.2, p=0.007) and cough (OR 2, 95%CI 1.1-3.6, p=0.03). Twenty-five of 238

  High seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among people living in precarious situations in Ile de France, Oct 2020
  participants with symptoms (10.5%) reported being tested for COVID previously, of which nine had a
  positive result and seven were admitted to COVID treatment centres.
  Discussion
  This study is the first in Europe to evaluate the exposure to SARS-COV-2 virus of populations who lived
  in precarious situations during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show overall a
  high exposure to SARS-COV-2 with important variations between sites. This study also identifies
  overcrowding as the most important factor to explain the variability in exposure rather than reported
  adherence to the recommended preventive measures. The results further suggest living conditions
  within the place of residence as the most important risk factor related to exposure, as frequently
  leaving the place of residence was associated with a lower risk of being seropositive. Coherent with
  other studies (22,23) evaluating the spectrum of COVID-19 disease, there was a high proportion of
  asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic infections (up to 68%) in a population that is younger on average
  than the general European population. Combined with the high proportion of exposed individuals, the
  high proportion of asymptomatic cases puts into question the pertinence of epidemic surveillance
  strategies solely based on the identification of symptomatic cases and their contacts.
  Our study has several limitations. First, due to the cross-sectional study design, it is not possible to
  determine when participants became seropositive. In relation to the sampling strategy, the selection
  of the study sites was not random: the locations were determined by MSF’s operational activities
  during the first wave of the pandemic in Ile-de-France and other considerations including security
  constraints and agreement of the sites to give the survey team access. Therefore, our results cannot
  be extrapolated to other populations living in similarly precarious situations in France or elsewhere.
  The selection of participants within the study sites could be potentially subject to bias despite the
  efforts made by the study team to obtain a representative sample; depending on the site, up to one
  third of those originally selected for inclusion were replaced by another participant. If those replacing
  the initially selected individuals had a higher risk of exposure, due to, for example, spending more t
  more time within the place of residence, this could have led to an overestimate of prevalence in the
  study population. Conversely, refusal to participate could have been higher among those who had
  previously tested positive, which would bias the seroprevalence estimate in the opposite direction. In
  addition to possible selection bias, information bias may have affected the measurement of other self-
  reported exposures,, including living conditions before and during confinement, COVID symptoms and
  onset period, and adherence to prevention measures. We also cannot exclude social desirability bias,
  particularly related to compliance with containment and prevention measures, that potentially
  underestimates exposure. Our efforts to mitigate information bias included the use of standardized
                                                                                                                              10

  interviews.
  Previous evaluation of the LuLISA tests have shown very high sensitivity and specificity. These
  estimates may, however, be revised in the future when results of other evaluation studies become
  available. Although we cannot exclude misclassification of some tested samples, our sensitivity analysis
  showed that even assuming a diagnostic test sensitivity or specificity as low as 70%, seroprevalence
  estimates by type of sites remain high (82.4-95.0% for workers’ residences, 34.7-62.0% for emergency
  shelters, and 16.2-38.5% for food distribution sites) (Supplementary material).
  While several definitions of overcrowding exist, in Europe and North America it is defined as more than
  one single person or couple per habitable room (24). In this adult study population, only 23.4% [20.4-
  26.5] overall reported having a single occupancy room; additionally, only 14.9% [12.6-17.6] had their
  own bathroom and 23.7% [20.8-26.8] their own kitchen. A recent computer-based study of the
  homeless population in England also emphasized the importance of single-room accommodation,
  combined with heightened infection prevention methods, in preventing COVID-19 deaths (25).
  Congregate housing conditions, whether long term or as temporary emergency measures, carry risks
  during an infectious disease outbreak that should be weighed against the risks in remaining
  unsheltered. The extent to which these risks can be mitigated, using masks and hand hygiene in
  crowded living environments and or situations with high seroprevalence as seen in our study, remains
  uncertain. It may be that the good reported adherence to hygiene measures and frequently reported
  mask wearing contributed to the high proportion of asymptomatic infections seen in this study (26).
  Lack of housing is a known risk factor for poor physical and mental health, and overcrowding for
  infectious diseases (27,28). This poses a complex dilemma for public health policy makers who aim to
  balance individual health risks and public health in the face of a global pandemic. While ours is the first
  study to identify overcrowding specifically as a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among an
  already vulnerable population in IDF, , large household size has been identified as a risk factor for
  COVID-19 in a recent study in the general population of France (4) as well as in a study focusing on a
  cohort of pregnant women tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in New York City(29). Many others have shown
  that the COVID-19 pandemic highlights existing socioeconomic and racial inequalities and inequities
  (30–32).
  In conclusion, the results presented here highlight a high level of exposure to SARS-COV-2 virus, with
  substantial variability among our sampled population. This underscores the importance of identifying
  populations at high risk of exposure, understanding the factors that determine this risk to orient
  prevention and control strategies, and adaptation according to the needs of the affected population.

  High seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among people living in precarious situations in Ile de France, Oct 2020
  Relocations of individuals living in insecure conditions, particularly those at highest risk of severe
  disease (i.e. elderly individuals and/ or individuals with certain comorbidities), should be implemented;
  this process should limit the number of people per room and ensure access to hygienic shared spaces.
  Based on a high seroprevalence, older average age and other risk factors, adapted strategies for the
  workers’ residence should be prioritized.
  Finally, considering the lack of existing data globally, further epidemiological studies in populations
  experiencing similar vulnerable conditions should be considered, including qualitative studies, in order
  to properly protect at-risk populations.

  1.     Further details – serological test results
  Figure S1 shows a density plot of observed relative light units per second (RLU/S) among study
  participants. Positivity for LULISA assays was defined by a cut-off of 10,291 RLU/s; however as the
  distribution of RLU/s is continuous (and not bimodal); misclassification of participants may occur at
  values close to the used cut-off. While the main peak in density occurs at RLU/s values lower than the
  cut-off, q second small peak in density occurs at higher values (50,000-75,000 RLU/s) potentially
  reflecting individuals with multiple exposures.
  Figure S1. Distribution of LuLISA IgG-N and LuLISA IgG-S RLU/S among study participants. The dashed
  value indicates the threshold used to define seropositivity (10,291 RLU/s).
  The test results by serology technique (LuLISA IgG-N, LuLISA IgG-S, PNT) are summarized in Table S1.
  PNT can be considered more specific than LuLISA; seroprevalence estimates obtained by PNT can
  therefore be considered as conservative estimates of seroprevalence. Misclassification based on
  LuLISA may be related to the transmission setting, where in low prevalence settings seroprevalence
  estimates by LuLISA may be more strongly overestimated than in high prevalence settings, which is
  reflected by a higher relative prevalence of LuLISA compared to PNT. This tendency is also visible in
  the relative prevalences of LuLISA compared to PNT by recruitment sites (Figure S2). Overall,
  concordance between the techniques was pretty strong (Figure S3).

  2. Composite crowding indicator
  We first categorized number of people sharing the room (0, 1, 2-5, and >5 people), sharing a sanitary
  facility (0, 1-5, and >5 people), sharing a kitchen (0, 1-5, and >5 people), and number of close contacts
  per day (0, 1-4, 5-10, >10 people). We then created a composite indicator of the sum of levels of the
  categorical variable and created categories as low (values ≤5), medium (values 6-9), and high (values
  ≥10). For example, an individual sharing the room with no other person (level 1), the kitchen and
  sanitary facilities with 1 other person (each of level 2), and who reported on average 1 close contact
  per day (level 2) would be assigned an indicator value of seven – representing the medium crowding
  category.
  3. Sensitivity analysis – seroprevalence estimates by type of sites
  We performed a sensitivity analysis of seroprevalence estimates taking uncertainty about diagnostic
  test performances into account as described in “Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in
  Geneva, Switzerland (SEROCoV-POP): a population-based study. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-
  6736(20)31304-0”. To estimate seroprevalence and 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) of site types we
  used a Bayesian logistic regression model including the type of site as fixed effect, integrated with a
  binomial model of assumed diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity.
  We then made several assumptions about diagnostic test sensitivities as evaluated:
  35 true positive samples out of 35 positive controls (Sens 35/35) and 32 true negative samples out of
  32 negative controls (Spec 32/32) (as reported in “Sensitivity in Detection of Antibodies to
  Nucleocapsid and Spike Proteins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Patients With
  Coronavirus Disease 2019. https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa273”)
        (i)      70 true positive samples out of 100 positive controls (Sens 70/100) and 70 true negative
                 samples out of 100 negative controls (Spec 70/100)
        (ii)     100 true positive samples out of 100 positive controls (Sens 100/100) and 70 true negative
                 samples out of 100 negative controls (Spec 70/100)
        (iii)    70 true positive samples out of 100 positive controls (Sens 70/100) and 100 true negative
                 samples out of 100 negative controls (Spec 100/100)
  The estimated seroprevalence for emergency shelters ranged from 34.7-62.0% (compared to the main
  estimate of 50.5%); for food distribution sites it ranged from 16.2-38.5% (compared to the main
  estimate of 27.8%); and for workers’ residences it ranged from 82.4-95.0% (compared to the main
  estimate of 88.7%).

      Here we present results of a sensitivity analysis of the multivariable analysis of risk factors for
      seropositivity. In addition to the main model which had the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
      of 938- we additionally tested models without site random effects, without adjusting for the type of
      site, or with number of people sharing the room as alternative crowding indicator.
