  25      Abstract
  26      Introduction
  27      The novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe global health threat since its
  28      emergence. Overcoming the virus is partly dependent on the holistic wellbeing of frontline
  29      health workers. Implications of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa could
  30      be substantial given the limited resources and logistics. This scoping review maps available
  31      literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa.
  32      Materials and methods
  33      Literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa were
  34      searched in six databases namely Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar,
  35      Africa Journals Online (AJOL) and CINAHL. Further search was done across websites of the
  36      ministries of health of West African countries and notable organisations. We conducted a
  37      narrative synthesis of the findings taking cognisance of the overarching purpose of the study
  38      and the research question.
  39      Results
  40      Of the 67 studies identified, 19 were included in the final synthesis. Three main themes
  41      emerged and these are impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers, drivers of
  42      susceptibility to COVID-19 and government/donor support. A greater number of the studies
  43      originated from Nigeria. Each study reported at least one impact of COVID-19 on frontline
  44      health workers in West Africa. The impacts included death, fear, unwillingness to attend to
  45      COVID-19 patients and stigmatisation. Some health workers were not adhering to the safety
                                                                       2

  46      protocols coupled with periodic shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and thereby
  47      had an increased susceptibility.
  48      Conclusion
  49      Being the first scoping review on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in
  50      West Africa, the study has illustrated the urgent need for West African governments to enact
  51      laws/rules that would compel all frontline health workers to adhere to all the COVID-19
  52      protocols at the workplace. To end intermittent shortage or issue of inadequate PPEs,
  53      governments ought to liaise with local industries by empowering them, providing financial
  54      support and creating a conducive atmosphere for them to produce cost effective PPEs using
  55      available local resources.

  67      Introduction
  68      The novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe global health threat since its
  69      emergence [1]. As of 5:15pm CEST, 1 October 2020, there were 33,842,281 cases of
  70      COVID-19 with 1,010,634 deaths globally [2]. The pandemic has affected both low and
  71      middle-income countries as well as high income countries. The role of frontline healthcare
  72      providers is therefore indispensable in the combat against COVID-19. These health workers
  73      are expected to have a close exposure to COVID-19 infected persons at varying stages of the
  74      infection thereby increasing their susceptibility and tendency of further spread [3]. In spite of
  75      the fact that COVID-19 has impacted the global community, the virulence level and impact
  76      vary across environmental, demographic, socio-economic and demographic spheres [4].
  77      Admittedly, healthcare providers have been impacted by the COVID-19 in high income
  78      countries such as the UK and USA [3]. However, the impact for frontline health workers in
  79      low and middle income countries such as those in West Africa may be substantial owing to a
  80      number of factors. For instance, in addition to the fact that health indices in West African
  81      countries are the lowest in the world, the pandemic can easily overwhelm the ailing health
  82      systems across West Africa, which are operated by inadequate health personnel [5]. In
  83      addition, implications of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa could be
  84      substantial given the limited resources and logistics [6]. All countries in West Africa are in
  85      either low or middle income category with little budget allocation to the health sector, thus
  86      ranging between 0.6% and 3.4% [5]. The sparse distribution and rural nature of some
  87      locations could pose difficulty in sending an infected health worker from a rural setting to a
  88      tertiary or secondary level health facilities which are predominantly in urban locations [7].
  89      Consequently, the ability of countries in the sub-region to finance and implement the
                                                                       4

  90      requisite measures needed to protect frontline health workers and boost the health systems to
  91      rise to the pandemic may be compromised.
  92      Overcoming the novel COVID-19 is partly dependent on the holistic wellbeing of frontline
  93      health workers [7]. Even though protection of frontline health workers against COVID-19 is a
  94      priority global concern [8, 9], no scoping review have been executed to collate the magnitude
  95      of impact on frontline health workers, the specific factors that increase susceptibility and
  96      measures instituted to protect frontline health workers from the impacts of the virus in West
  97      Africa. COVID-19 has been confirmed in all sixteen (16) West African countries [10]. By
  98      September 22nd 2020, a total of 172,594 cases and 2,580 deaths had been recorded in the sub-
  99      region [11].
 100      The WHO reports that COVID-19 infections among frontline health workers usually occur at
 101      the work place [12]. This underscores the need to explore the situation in West Africa to
 102      unravel the documeted impact of the virus on frontline health workers. Previous studies on
 103      COVID-19 in West Africa are predominantly reviews focusing on specific countries [13-17].
 104      This is therefore the first scoping review to collate evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on
 105      frontline health workers in West Africa guided by the question: “How has COVID-19
 106      impacted frontline healthcare providers in West Africa?” Outcome of the study would not
 107      only inform governments and policy makers on the specific socio-culturally sensitive policies
 108      required to safeguard the wellbeing of the limited frontline health workers but would as well
 109      prompt frontline health workers on what they could do at the personal level to mitigate their
 110      susceptibility to the virus whilst taking care of COVID-19 and other patients.
 111      Materials and methods
 112      We conducted a scoping review between July and October 2020 with respect to the
 113      guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute’s Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
                                                                       5

 115      study was guided by a protocol registered with the Open Science Framework (DOI
 116      10.17605/OSF.IO/B9NXZ).
 117      Population of interest
 118      The review focused on frontline health workers in West Africa. Frontline health worker
 119      included any category of healthcare provider who has been providing healthcare and have
 120      been directly interacting with patients from 2019 to August 2020.
 121      Eligibility criteria and study selection
 122      Citations of all published articles were first exported to EndNote and subsequently to the
 123      Covidence online systematic review platform. Three key steps were followed to screen the
 124      studies; (a) deduplication, (b) title and abstract screening and, (c) full text screening. In the
 125      case of the grey literature, selection for inclusion was strictly based on the assessment
 126      outcome as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. Included studies satisfied the
 127      following: (i) conducted in West Africa, (ii) reports about frontline health workers, (iii)
 128      focuses on any impact of COVID-19, (iv) employed experimental/quasi-experimental,
 129      observational, quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods, (v) reports/editorials/commentaries,
 130      (vi) in English, French or Spanish (vii) and published between December 2019 and August
 131      2020. Out of the total studies, 19 were included in the final synthesis (see Figure 1).
 132      Sources of data and search strategy
 133      We conducted an electronic search for both peer-reviewed articles and grey literature. Six
 134      databases were searched for published articles: Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE,
 135      Google Scholar, Africa Journals Online (AJOL) and CINAHL. We searched for grey
 136      literature (e.g. reports, press periodic briefings) from the websites of ministries of health of
                                                                       6

  139               Prevention (Africa CDC), and WHO Regional Office for Africa. Our search followed four
  140               cardinal steps: (1) use of search terms for articles in the six aforesaid databases; (2) search for
  141               grey literature from websites of key organisations and ministries of health of each West
  142               African country; (3) manual search for commentaries/editorials/opinions and; (4) manual
  143               search of reference lists of included article. A complete search strategy and key words used
  144               for PubMed have been provided (S1).

 159      Quality assessment
 160      The quality assessment was conducted independently by one author (EKA) and verified by
 161      another author (KAP). This was done with the McMaster Critical review                                    [19]. The
 162      Authority, Accuracy, Coverage, Objectivity, Date, and Significance (AACODS) Checklist
 163      was used to assess the quality of the non-peer reviewed studies [20].
 164
 165      Data charting
 166      We developed a data charting form and this was used to extract important data required to
 167      address the overarching review question. The form constituted the following components: (a)
 168      author(s) and year of publication, (b) country/scope of study, (c) title, (d) study type, (e)
 169      study design, (f) theme and; (g) key findings.
 170
 171      Synthesis and reporting of findings
 172      We carried out a thematic analysis of the findings from the included studies. Thematic
 173      analysis is “a method for identifying, analyzing and reporting patterns within data.” [21].
 174      Three principal themes emerged and the findings were categorised according to these themes.
 175      Subsequently, we interpreted and conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings taking
 176      cognisance of the overarching purpose of the study and the research question.

 189      Narrative synthesis
 190      Three principal themes emerged from the included studies: (a) impact of COVID-19 on
 191      frontline health            workers; (b) drivers             of susceptibility to COVID-19                and; (c)
 192      government/donor support. All the records associated with each theme and sub-theme are
 193      summarised in Table 2.
 194      Theme 1: impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers
 195      Almost all included studies reported at least one impact of COVID-19 on frontline health
 196      workers. The dominant impact was COVID-19 infection among frontline health workers such
 197      as doctors and nurses as reported by fourteen studies [13, 14, 16, 17, 23-32]. Some health
 198      care providers expressed fear of being at risk of contracting COVID-19 and subsequent death
 199      [17, 22, 28, 33] as well as expression of worry and sadness [34]. COVID-19 had also reduced
 200      the passion or willingness to work in Nigeria [22], and also brought about stigmatisation and
 201      separation from families [29].
 202      Theme 2: drivers of susceptibility to COVID-19
                                                                       12

 203      Three dominant factors were noted to increase frontline health workers’ susceptibility to
 204      COVID-19 in West Africa. The commonly reported was inadequate infrastructure/equipment
 205      predominantly from Nigeria [15, 16, 28, 33, 35], Ghana [17] and Guinea-Bissau [13]. In the
 206      case of Ghana [34] and Liberia [26], non-adherence to the COVID-19 safety protocols among
 207      frontline health workers was reported whilst insecure work environment [22] was recounted
 208      as factor that enhances susceptibility of frontline health workers to COVID-19 in Nigeria
 209      [22].
 210      Theme 3: Government/Donor support
 211      To alleviate the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers, governments have adopted
 212      varied interventions and strategies. A number of non-governmental and international
 213      organisations have also supported. For instance, the United Nations International Children’s
 214      Emergency Fund (UNICEF) appeared to have assisted in diverse ways. Specific approaches
 215      for combating the COVID-19 among frontline healthcare providers include training as
 216      evidenced in Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria [23, 35] as well as acquisition and distribution of
 217      personal protective and other essential equipment as reported from The Gambia [14], and
 218      Nigeria [16, 35]. The support have also manifested in physical infrastructure [24] and
 219      provision of social services (e.g. encouraging preventive actions in communities through risk
 220      communications) [35] in Ghana and Nigeria respectively.

 223      Discussion
 224      This review is the first to synthesise evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health
 225      workers in West Africa. The review has illustrated the peculiar implications of COVID-19 on
 226      frontline health workers in West Africa, factors that increase their susceptibility and ongoing
 227      support/commitment by governments and donor organisations.
 228      A key theme from the review is that COVID-19 has affected and continues to affect frontline
 229      health workers in diverse ways with infection among frontline health workers emerging as
 230      the dominant impact. Others were death, fear of being at risk, worry, attenuated preparedness
 231      to work, stigmatisation and insecure workplace. This indicates that West Africa contributes to
 232      the globally estimated 30,000 deaths among frontline health workers [36]. Due to these
 233      implications, some health workers are reluctant to attend to COVID-19 patients even if
 234      adequately compensated [22]. Similar reports have emerged from other countries outside
 235      West Africa such as Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan where death, worry and mental
 236      health issues were noted among frontline health workers [37-39]. The findings indicate the
 237      need for extra care and support for West African based frontline health workers especially
 238      during pandemics because the overwhelmed health systems further present challenging times
 239      for health workers [40]. To this end, putting in place sustainable insurance policy [22],
 240      ensuring safe, decent work conditions and intermittent psychological services for frontline
 241      health workers may be required to mitigate these implications in West Africa [40]. These can
                                                                       15

 242      be achieved through inter-sectoral collaboration between governments, employers and
 243      workers’ organisations. More importantly, stakeholders’ ability to contexualise protective
 244      measures in line with local resources and inter-country nuances might be prudent.
 245      The review identified three factors that incline frontline health workers to COVID-19 in West
 246      Africa; insecure workplace environment, non-adherence to COVID-19 safety protocols or
 247      carelessness and inadequate infrastructure and equipment including Personal Protective
 248      Equipment (PPE). These reflect both systemic gaps and negligence on the part of frontline
 249      health workers. In as much as West African governments and their partners are obliged to
 250      ensure safety and holistic wellbeing of frontline health workers amidst the COVID-19, the
 251      frontline health workers also have an essential role to play in order to ameliorate the situation.
 252      Some level of discipline is required by the frontline health workers to ensure their own safety
 253      because non-use of PPEs or non-adherence of the COVID-19 protocols is as perilous
 254      government’s refusal to purchase and distribute such lifesaving resources or equipment.
 255      More workshops on COVID-19 protocols, constant reminders (e.g. through text messaging,
 256      audio-visuals) and sanctioning of frontline health workers who ignore the protocols may help
 257      to ensure that the all frontline health workers in West Africa are committed to ensuring their
 258      own safety. Further, frontline health workers who are sensitive to the COVID-19 protocols
 259      and those who fully observe the protocols may be incentivised to motivate others to do same.
 260      Government and partner organisations, however, may have to intervene to ensure safe
 261      workplace for the frontline health workers by expanding infrastructure and ensuring
 262      consistent supply of PPEs. Regular training of health workers in emergency preparedness can
 263      make them conscious and responsive the pandemic and subsequent disease outbreaks.
 264      The study revealed that the support offered to frontline health workers by West African
 265      governments and donor organisations manifest in training, acquisition and distribution of
                                                                       16

 266      equipment, physical infrastructure and social services. These illustrate that governments of
 267      various West African countries and some donor partners have instituted some measures with
 268      respect to infrastructure and equipment with the aim of boosting the health systems to
 269      overcome the novel COVID-19. In Gambia, for instance, the government has expended $12
 270      million on equipment to support the country’s health by acquiring ventilators, ambulances
 271      and PPEs since March 2020 to support the overwhelmed health system and expedite the
 272      combat against COVID-19 [14]. A number of West African countries such as Ghana and
 273      Nigeria have done same through the assistance of partner organisations such as the WHO [41,
 274      42]. West African countries can also establish health emergency funds to cushion the health
 275      systems during disease outbreaks.
 276      However, our evidence support previous findings on the inadequacy and intermittent shortage
 277      of essential PPEs among frontline health workers [43, 44]. Most of these PPEs are imported
 278      [45] and could possibly account for the intermittent shortages. It is therefore imperative for
 279      West African countries to ulitise local resources to develop domestic PPEs whenever possible
 280      in order not to be over reliant on international trade. This is essentially critical considering
 281      that the pandemic compelled most countries to close their borders, a situation that do not
 282      permit international transfer of PPEs.
 283      Strengths and limitations
 284      Most of the included studies were not peer-reviewed. This is due to the recency of COVID-19
 285      and its late entry into West Africa compared to other sub-regions. The review focused on
 286      only frontline health workers and hence could not account for the impact of COVID-19 on
 287      other category of health workers within West Africa.
 288      Conclusion
                                                                       17

 289      Being the first scoping review on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in
 290      West Africa, the review has highlighted the specific impacts, as well as essential systemic
 291      and health personnel gaps reinforcing the impact. The review has also revealed ongoing
 292      support and commitment by governments and partner organisations. There is an urgent need
 293      for West African governments to enact laws/rules that would compel all frontline health
 294      workers to adhere to all the COVID-19 protocols at the workplace. Effective supervision may
 295      be essential for achieving full implementation of such laws/rules. To end intermittent
 296      shortage or issue of inadequate PPEs, governments ought to liaise with local industries by
 297      empowering them, providing financial support and creating a conducive atmosphere for them
 298      to produce cost effective PPEs using available local resources. More empirical studies are
 299      required to better understand the country specific and contextual factors associated with the
 300      impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers across the sixteen West African countries.
