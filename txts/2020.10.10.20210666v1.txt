             Abstract
             Background: Many previous studies have analyzed the status of retracted publications
             from different perspectives, but so far no study has focused on systematic reviews (SRs).
             The purpose of this study is to analyze the retraction status and reasons of
             non-Cochrane SRs in the field of medicine.
             Methods: We searched MEDLINE and Embase from their inception to April 18, 2020,
             as well as Retraction Watch Database and Google Scholar with no language restriction
             to find non-Cochrane SRs that were retracted for any reason. Two reviewers
             independently screened and extracted data. We describe the characteristic and reasons of
             retraction and the duration from publication to retraction.
             Results: We identified 150 non-Cochrane SRs in medicine retracted between 2004 and
             2020. The majority of retracted SRs were led by authors from China and affiliated with
             hospitals. Most SRs were published in journals with an impact factor ≤3, and in journal
             ranked in the third quarter. The largest proportion of retraction notices were issued by
             the publisher and editor(s) jointly; seven did not report this information. Fraudulent
             peer-review was the most common reason for retraction, followed by unreliable data
             meaning errors in study selection or data analysis. The median time between publication
             and retraction was 14.0 months. SRs retracted due to research misconduct took longer to
             retract than SRs retracted because of honest error.
             Conclusions: The situation with retracted SRs is critical globally, and in particular in
             China. The most common reasons for retraction are fraudulent peer-review and
             unreliable data, and in most cases the study is retracted more than a year after
             publication. Efforts should be made to improve the process of peer review and
             adherence to the COPE retraction guidance, while at the same time authors should
             strengthen their skills in SR methodology.
             Keywords: Retraction; Systematic review; non-Cochrane; Research ethics.

             Background
                       Retractions of published articles are sometimes needed to maintain the integrity
             of the scientific literature and to alert the reader of potential serious problems identified
                                          [1,2]
             within the article                 . The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) published
             retraction guidance in 2009. Reasons for retraction include unreliable data, redundant
             publication, plagiarism, and failure to disclose conflict of interest. Unreliable data may
             result from honest error (such as mis-calculation or experimental error) or from research
             misconduct (such as data fabrication) [2]. A study published in 2011 found that in the
             past decade, the number of retraction notices has shot up 10-fold, even as the literature
                                                          [3]
             has expanded by only 44%                         . Another study published in 2019 showed that of the
             21,859,178 publications indexed in the Web of science between 1978 and 2017, 2,859
             were retracted, of which, the United States has the most retractions, but China has the
                                              [4]
             highest retraction rate              . Retractions involved papers led by researchers from over 50
                                            [5]
             countries worldwide                . Having a paper retracted does not only affect the academic
             status and reputation of individual authors, leading possibly to administrative, civil, and
             criminal sanctions, but also correlates with decreased productivity, funding and
                             [5-7]
             resources             . Retractions of publications in the field of biomedicine also propose a
             great threat to public health [8].
                     Systematic Reviews (SR), which are being widely used in the domain of medicine,
             have had a revolutionary impact in many fields of science, helping to establish
                                                  [9,10]
             evidence-based practice                     . Scientifically rigorous SRs, carried out following formal
             protocols, have long been considered at the top of the hierarchy of evidence-based
             medicine studies. SRs integrate information, address well-defined questions and lead to
             new insights, but also provide a robust overview of a problem or field of research, and
             serve as important evidence for development of clinical practice guidelines. Therefore,
             SRs are an essential part of clinical decision-making and research [11,12]. To avoid waste
                                                                                                                           [13]
             of research, no new studies should be done without a SR of existing evidence                                       .

             However, while the number of published and registered SRs has increased substantially
             over the past 20 years, the extent to which their implications are correctly understood is
                                                                                                                       [14-18]
             poor. The majority of produced SRs are unnecessary, misleading, or conflicted                                     ,
             and this is a particular problem among non-Cochrane SRs used less rigorous methods
             than Cochrane reviews [19]. In recent years, there is a growing call to reduce the number
             of articles that need to be later retracted.
                     To the best of our knowledge, no research has yet specifically aimed to describe
             the main features of retracted SRs. Therefore, on behalf of PRESS (Publication Science
             of Retracted Studies) working group, present study aims to perform an in-depth analysis
             of the status and reasons of retracted non-Cochrane SRs and meta-analyses in the field
             of medicine.
             Methods
             Search strategy
                     Two reviewers (Qianling Shi and Zijun Wang) comprehensively searched
             MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Embase from their inception through April 18th, 2020.
             No language restriction was applied. We conducted the search by combining the MeSH
             and free words including “Retraction”, “Withdraw”, “Remove”, “Meta-analysis”,
             “Systematic Review” and their derivatives. The search strategy was also peer reviewed
             by an external specialist. Details of the search can be found in the Supplementary
             Material I. We also retrieved data from the Retraction Watch Database (RWdb,
             www.retractionwatch.com) and Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.nl/) for relevant
             studies that met the inclusion criteria. RWdb is a public platform for retractions of
             scientific papers, it is considered as the largest and most comprehensive database of
             retracted articles [20].
             Inclusion and exclusion criteria
                     We included all non-Cochrane SRs published in the field of medicine that were

                                                                                                                               5
             retracted. The corresponding retraction notices were also extracted for analysis. Studies
             were excluded if they were: 1) duplicates; 2) use of the words “retraction” or “retracted”
             but with a different meaning from the one considered by the present review; 3) topic
             unrelated to the field of medicine; 4) topic related to the field of medicine in animals; 5)
             retracted Cochrane SRs; and 6) retracted SRs that were republished.
             Study selection
                     Two reviewers (Qianling Shi and Zijun Wang) independently screened first the
             titles and abstracts after eliminating duplicates, and then the full-texts for potentially
             relevant articles, using pre-defined criteria. The specific bibliographic software
             EndNote X9 was used. Discrepancies were discussed, if necessary with a third
             researcher (Qi Zhou). The process of study selection was documented using a flow
             diagram.
             Data extraction
                     Two reviewers (Qianling Shi and Zijun Wang) independently extracted the
             following data with a standardized data collection form: 1) basic information (title of
             retracted article, country and affiliation of the first author, year and month of online
             publication and retraction); 2) journal information (journal name, impact factor [IF] of
             2018 according to ISI Web of Knowledge, quartile in Journal Citations Reports (JCR) of
             Thomson Reuters of 2018); 3) retraction characteristics (who retracted the article [the
             decision to retract a paper can be made by editors, authors or the author's employer,
             publisher or others], reasons for retraction, availability of retraction notice).
                   After considering classifications of retractions in previous studies, retraction reasons
             for SRs were classified into the following categories, and definitions are as follows
             [1,2,5,21]
                        .
                  1) Repetitive research: the content of the retracted article is the same as that of a
                         previously published paper;

                                                                                                                               6
                  2) Data falsification: data has been manipulated or made up;
                  3) Duplicate publication: the paper had been published more than once or there was
                        significant overlap between manuscripts (usually as a result of author
                        misconduct);
                  4) Authorship issues: not all authors aware of manuscript submission;
                  5) Plagiarism: duplication of text from previously published articles;
                  6) Unreliable data: data has error due to miscalculation or experimental error; in the
                        case of SRs, this can be an error in study selection, data collection, data analysis,
                        result interpretation, etc.
                  7) Fraudulent peer-review: it can arise when editors rely on authors’ recommended
                        reviewers. The names are often genuine but have a false e-mail address that
                        enables the authors to write a favourable review of their own paper, thereby
                        facilitating acceptance.
                  8) Others: reasons that cannot be divided into the above categories.
                  All reasons were classified by one reviewer (Qianling Shi) and checked for
             agreement by another reviewer (Zijun Wang) using the information given in the
             retraction notice, any discrepancies were settled by discussion. If we were unable to
             retrieve the notice, we searched the RWdb to find information about the reasons and
             characteristics of retraction. When multiple reasons for the retraction were given, all
             were described and noted.
             Statistical analysis
                     Descriptive statistics of the retraction characteristic, reasons for retraction, and
             time to retraction (defined as the time from original publication date to retraction date
             and) of articles were calculated. Two independent reviewers (Qianling Shi and Zijun
             Wang) analysed all datasets with SPSS 18 Software. Comparisons of the causes for
             retraction among sub-groups (IF, journal rank in JCR) were performed using the Chi
             square test or variance analysis, and t test was used to compare the time from

             publication to retraction. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Categorical data
             were reported using frequencies and/or percentages. Continuous variables were
             described using median with range (minimum to maximum) or interquartile range (IQR).
             We also analyzed the adherence to COPE guidance on retraction in all respects (which
             suggest that retractions be linked to the retracted article, be clearly identified as a
             retraction, published promptly and freely available to all readers. Retractions should
             also state who is retracting the article, reason(s) for retraction and avoid statements that
             are potentially defamatory or libellous, of which, issuers can be author(s), journal editor
             or journal’s owner such as a learned society or publisher) [2].
             Results
             Search results
                     Electronic and additional search resulted in a total of 1,945 records (1,453 in
             MEDLINE, 430 in Embase and 62 in RWdb). Of these records, 945 were excluded as
             duplicates. After screening the titles, abstract and full texts, a total of 150 non-Cochrane
             SRs in the field of medicine retracted between 2004 and 2020 were included. The

             Study characteristic
                     The characteristics of the 150 included studies are displayed in Table 1. As shown
             in Figure 2, with the total number of published SRs is large and growing over the past
             decade (from 2011 to 2020), the total number of retracted SRs is small but increased as
             well. The first SR, published in 2003, was retracted in 2004, and the highest retraction
             rate was in 2015 (n=43, 28.7%). The first authors of retracted SRs were from 18
             countries, most from Asia (n=126, 84.0%). China was the leading country of origin for
             the total number of retracted publications (n=113, 75.3%), followed by the United

             2.7%). The most frequent type of organization of the first author was hospital (n=106,
             70.7%), followed by university (n=41, 27.3%).
                     A total of 79 journals were involved. Tumor Biology retracted the most (n=23,
             15.3%), followed by Molecular Biology Reports (n=13, 8.7%), Medicine (n=9, 6.0%)
             and Molecular Neurobiology (n=9, 6.0%). All included SRs were written in English
             (except one that was published in Chinese. Most articles (n=120, 80.0%) were published
             in journals listed in the Science Citation Index (SCI). Most retracted SRs (n=85, 56.7%)
             were published in low impact (≤3) journals, and most were from journal ranked in the
             third highest quarter (n=39, 26.0%), followed by journals in the second highest quarter
             (n=35, 23.3%).
                     Not all retraction notices were clearly labelled and linked to the retracted articles.
             For a total of 148 (98.7%) studies a retraction notice was published, of which the first in
             2004. For two (1.3%) studies no retraction notice was issued, but the study was
             presented with a watermark to identify the article was retracted. For these studies, we
             determined the issuer of the retraction notice as unclear.

                        We categorized the entities that retracted the 150 SRs into nine groups (Table 2).
             The largest proportion of retraction notices were issued by the publisher and editor(s)
             jointly (n=60, 40.0%), followed by the editor alone (n=27, 18.0%) and author alone

             issued the retraction notice. Of the eight notices, two were from the author(s) and/or
             editor, one was from publisher or journal, three used the words as “we”, one used the
             words as “they”, and for two no notice was issued. Although most retraction notices
             declared who retracted the article, 7 (4.7%) did not explicitly state this information.

             Reasons of retraction
                    A total of 161 reasons for retraction were mentioned for the included 150 SRs
             (Table 3). We divided the retraction reasons into three categories: honest error
             (unreliable data), misconduct (data fabrication, plagiarism, duplicate publication,
             authorship issues, compromised peer review), and unclear (not possible to distinguish
             “honest error” from “misconduct”). The vast majority of retracted SRs (n=100, 66.7%)
             were due to some form of research misconduct.
                     The most common reason for retraction was fraudulent peer-review (n=61, 37.9%),
             followed by unreliable data (n=41, 25.5%) and plagiarism (n=30, 18.6%). Most reasons
             classified as unreliable data were due to error in either the selection of included studies,
             or in data analysis (Table 4). Other reasons included duplicate publication (n=9, 5.6%),
             authorship issues (n=8, 5.0%) and only one (0.6%) was retracted due to data fabrication.
             No articles were retracted due to repetitive research. For some retraction statements,
             which appeared to use deliberately ambiguous wording that made it difficult to

             distinguish honest errors from suspected (or proven) misconduct, we assigned into
             others (n=7, 4.4%). No reason was provided for four (2.5%) retractions. Figure 3 shows
             the growth and variation in reasons for retractions over time.
                     In 11 (7.3%) studies two reasons for retraction were given. Among the 11 retracted
             SRs, four were retracted due to fraudulent peer-review and plagiarism, two were
             retracted due to plagiarism and authorship issues, two were retracted due to fraudulent
             peer-review and authorship issues, one was retracted due to plagiarism and authorship
             issues, one due to plagiarism and unreliable data, and one due to unreliable data and
             concerns about third party involvement in editing submitted files.
                     In addition to this, causes for retraction also varied according to journal IF
             (P=0.000) and journal rank in JCR (P=0.000): retractions due to unreliable data was
             most frequent from journals with a high IF (equal or more than 5) or high journal rank
             (Q1 and Q2), while a faked review process was the main cause of retraction from
             journals with a low IF (less than 5), low journal rank (Q3 and Q4) and journals with no
             citation index. In-depth analysis showed that the most common reason for retraction in
             hospital and university was fraudulent peer-review and unreliable data, respectively.

             Reliability of retracted SRs
                     Retracted SRs have the potential to mislead current practice and future research
             through citations that occur before the publication of the retraction note, and erroneous
             citations that are made after the retraction. It is therefore important for researchers and
             readers to understand how much influence retracted SR can have on other studies. Our
             research group divided the reliability of retracted SRs into three categories:
                    1) High risk: The findings or conclusions of retracted SRs will be changed due to
                          retraction so that citations will be severely affected (including unreliable data,

                          data falsification).
                    2) Low risk: The findings or conclusions of retracted SRs will not be changed due
                          to retractions so that citations will not be affected (including repetitive research,
                          duplicate publication and authorship issues).
                    3) Unclear: we are uncertainty about whether the findings or conclusions of
                          retracted SRs will be changed or whether citations will be affected (including
                          compromised peer review and plagiarism)
                   The results in our study showed that 42 (28.0%) retracted SRs were considered as
             “high risk”, and only 12 (8.0%) as “low risk”.
             Discussion
                     Our study identified a total of 150 retracted non-Cochrane SRs in the field of
             medicine by 18 April 2020. The number of retractions steadily increased starting in
             2004. The most common reasons were fraudulent peer-review and unreliable data. More
             than 75% were from China. Detailed analysis of the retraction notices revealed that
             COPE guidelines on retraction were not adhered to in all respects. In general, the mean
             number of months from publication to retraction was more than one year, and articles
             involving apparent misconduct took longer to retract than honest error.
                  The results from our study suggested that faked peer review was the most common
             reason for retraction. The number of retracted SRs reached the highest in 2015, it may
             be related to the large-scale retractions of academia happened in this year. The publisher
             Springer Nature retracted 64 articles in ten of its journals on the basis of fake peer
             review in August 18, 2015 [22]. The retractions came only months after BioMed Central
                                                                     [23]
             retracted 43 articles on similar grounds                     . Two years later, Springer retracted another
             107 papers published in Tumor Biology [24]. Data from the wake of large-scale retraction
             scandals and recent studies in other fields showed that most of the retractions were from
             China, and majority of SRs were from hospitals and published in journals with low IF.
             Tumor Biology and Molecular Biology Reports retracted the largest number of studies,

             the results were similar to those identified in other studies                                     . SRs involving
             research misconduct (especially authorship issues and fraudulent peer-review) took
             longer to retract than honest error, which was also observed in previous studies
             [22-24,30-33]
                           .
                                                                                                                           [34]
                     Just as commented by Alison McCook on the Retraction Watch blog                                            ,
             retractions due to fabricated peer reviews are becoming a trend. With the current global
             research output with 20,000 journals publishing more than 2 million articles per year
             and thousands of scientists publish a paper every five days [35-36], researchers worldwide
             are under great pressure to publish papers indexed by SCI for graduation, promotion,
             and acquisition of research funds. The need to publish has grown beyond the capacity of
             the scientists [37-38]. Peer review aims to ensure that articles are “open and honest”, but it
             can be compromised when editors rely on authors' recommended reviewers. This form
             of misconduct is particularly intense in China, but it would be a mistake to look at this
             as a Chinese or Asian problem. In this case, it is of paramount importance to understand
             that incentives really work, but the problem is that the perverse incentive systems in
             scientific publishing exists almost everywhere and may increase the risk of scientific
             misconduct.
                     We also found that unreliable data was one of the important reasons for the
             retraction, involving more than one fourth of the studies, and some SRs included
             retracted primary studies [39-41]. SRs have the potential to provide sufficient sample size
             and generalizable population information to make more powerful evidence-based
             conclusions. Thus, great care must be used in the data analysis and determination of
             eligible studies. The methodology for conducting SRs has advanced enormously in the
             recent 30 years, authors should strengthen the study, and journals should refuse to
             publish SR not meeting rigorous standards [42-44]. It is recommended to use the Preferred
             Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and
             A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool for the design,
                                                            [45-47]
             reporting and evaluation of SRs                        . More importantly, previous studies have shown

                                                                                                                             19
             that retracted literature continues to be cited as valid and legitimate work in many
             scientific disciplines, even after flagged as retracted [48]. SRs are cornerstones of clinical
             practice guidelines in the medical field, and if retracted SRs are cited, the
             recommendations will be affected. Especially for SRs related to critical conditions, this
                                                                              [49]
             will pose a great threat to medical care                              . Therefore, appropriate production,
             publication and citation of high-quality studies is essential for clinical decision-making
             and research.
                     In addition, our analyses suggested that COPE guidelines on retraction were not
             adhered to all respects. We found that not all retracted SRs had a correspondence notice
             or “retracted” label, and some retraction notices did not explicitly state the retraction
             reasons and who issued the retraction. In addition, we classified issuers into editor,
             author, published and journal as notice reported, but it maybe difficult to distinguish
             many of these, because the editor represents the journal that is owned by the publisher,
             therefore, these are basically the same entity. Publication of a clear and unambiguous
             retraction notice is an important part of the retraction, and the notice should be clearly
             identifiable, freely available, published promptly and linked to the original article that is
             retracted (which also should be clearly labeled as retracted) [50].
             Further suggestions
                   Regardless of the reasons for retraction, retracted SRs sometimes continue to be
             cited, so retracting such papers alone is not enough. It is important to recognize the
             dangers related to citing retracted literature and have clear guidance about how to
             address this issue. We propose the following interim recommendations:
                     Authors should strengthen and refine the learning of methodology, and strictly
             follow the relevant guidelines and PRISMA statement to improve the quality of
             conducting SRs from determining the clinical question until the reporting of the results.
                                                                                                                           [51]
             We recommend open registration of all SRs to reduce the risk for duplicate work                                    .
             We emphasize the need to adhere to the principles of “5 dont’s of academic publishing”:
             ghostwriting, ghost submission, ghost revision, fake peer review, and falsified

             authorship. And it should be standard practice in all SRs to double-check the final list of
                                                                                         [52]
             included studies against the list of retracted articles                          . On the other hand, more
             detailed guidance on the inclusion/exclusion of retracted articles in SRs is needed,
             especially when the reason for retraction is not directly associated with a risk of
             inaccurate data, which are unlikely to affect the SR results [53].
                     For journal editors and publishers, the quality of peer review should be improved
             by shortening the period and make changes. It could be possible to do a bit more
             background check when selecting reviewers (even if first follow the recommendations),
             and probably combine with artificial intelligence. Experienced librarian, information
             specialist, or other search strategy experts can also be invited as methodological peer
                             [54]
             reviewers           . Data should be strictly screened and checked before the manuscript is
             published to prevent publishing plagiarized studies, or studies with erroneous or
             falsified data, and most importantly, systematic and organized publication process

             manipulation should be altered and tackled                         . We recommend to follow or adopt a
             checklist (such as COPE guidelines) and templates to provide adequate information
             related to the retractions, so that readers can know who retracted the article and why the
             findings are considered unreliable. On the other hand, if an included study gets retracted
             after the SR was published, issuing a correction should be considered and giving the
             authors chance to update their SR.
                     For national and other academic institutions, the key to stemming the flow of
             poor-quality misleading research requires a unified and standardization criterion and a
             change in academic culture. First, national academic committees should strengthen the
             development of a credibility system, and put in place relevant laws and regulations.
             Second, for studies with serious academic misconduct (such as data falsification and
             faked peer review), an effective system of precautions and penalties should be
             implemented. National academic committees and research institutes might consider
             revoking research funding for such authors and demoting them. Third, academic
             institutions including but not limited to universities and hospitals should provide

             scientific ethics and academic integrity training to students, teachers, clinicians and
             other researchers, clarify the purpose of scientific research and reform unreasonable
             incentive mechanisms (for example, changing the way research success is measured and
             changing the way journal and article quality is measured, although in this study we used
             IF which maybe widely criticized).
                     For evidence users including health professionals and other stakeholders,
             especially guideline developers, methodological experts should always be included in
             the formulation of recommendations to rigorously review the cited SRs in terms of
             quality and make the decision whether to directly adopt, update or reproduce the review,
             and ensure the quality of evidence and that recommendations are not affected by the
                                             [55-56]
             retracted publications                  . Clinicians, public health officials and other investigators
             can use AMSTAR tool to assess the methodological quality [47].
             Strengths and limitations
                     This study is to our knowledge the first to characterize the retraction status and
             reasons among non-Cochrane SRs in the field of medicine. We divided the risk of
             citation of retracted SRs into three categories according to the influence they can have
             on other studies. However, our study had also some limitations. First, we only searched
             the major international databases and websites, and did not search for example locally
             or regionally databases for research in other languages. Second, with so many SRs and
             rapid reviews to be published, especially in the recent setting of COVID-19, some of the
             studies may still become retracted so that the status and reasons may be changed.
             Conclusions
                     An increasing number of non-Cochrane SRs in the medical field are faced with the
             risk of retractions. China is the leading country of origin for retracted articles. The most
             common reasons for retraction are fraudulent peer-review and unreliable data. The
             average time from publication to retraction was 14 months, but some SRs were retracted
             even as much as nine years after publishing. Adherence to the COPE guidelines needs

             retraction process, and authors should strengthen their knowledge in methodology.
