 Abstract
 Objective: To study blood anti-Aβ antibodies in the context of spontaneous inflammatory or
 hemorrhagic CAA manifestations, which are similar to complications occurring after monoclonal
 anti-Aβ antibody immunotherapies.
 Methods: In this case-control study, serum anti-Aβ antibody isotype, concentration, avidity, and
 reactivity toward soluble or fibrillary Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 isoforms were assessed using an ELISA-
 based multiplex analysis. Anti-Aβ serologic patterns were defined in CAA and CAA subgroups using
 multivariable logistic regression analyses.
 Results: Fourty-one healthy aged controls and 64 CAA patients were recruited: 46 with hemorrhagic
 features (CAA-he) and 18 with CAA-related inflammation (CAA-ri). As compared to controls, the
 most striking features of CAA-related serological profiles were the following: i) both CAA-he and
 CAA-ri patients displayed lower binding diversity of anti-soluble Aβ1-40 IgM; ii) CAA-he patients
 displayed higher anti-soluble Aβ1-40 / fibrillary Aβ1-42 IgG4 concentrations ratio and higher anti-
 soluble Aβ1-42 IgG4 and IgA avidity; iii) CAA-ri patients displayed higher binding diversity of anti-
 soluble Aβ1-40 IgG3 and higher anti-fibrillary/soluble Aβ1-42 IgG4 dilution curve steepness ratio.
 Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study revealed anti-Aβ antibody variations in CAA patients, some
 of which were associated to CAA clinical phenotypes, unveiling pathophysiological insights
 regarding CAA-hemorrhagic and inflammatory related events.

 Introduction
 Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) relates to cortical and leptomeningeal vessel microangiopathy
 with accumulation of vascular amyloid fibrils made of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ).1 CAA is frequent in
 both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and non-AD aged participants. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)
 related to CAA (CAA-he) is a major health concern.2 CAA-related inflammation (CAA-ri) is a rare
 but treatable Aβ-related CNS vasculitis.3
 Dose-dependent adverse events similar to CAA-he and CAA-ri were observed upon anti-Aβ
 immunotherapy in AD,4 suggesting a role of anti-Aβ antibodies in CAA manifestations. Subsequent
 investigations revealed elevated CSF levels of anti-Aβ IgG during CAA-ri.5,6 However, it was shown
 experimentally that blood-borne more than CSF-borne anti-Aβ antibodies can aggravate CAA
 manifestations in mouse models.7,8
 As well as other auto-antibodies involved in neurodegenerative disorders, including anti-Tau protein9
 and anti-alpha synuclein antibodies,10 anti-Aβ antibodies belonging to the “natural” auto-antibody
 repertoire: they are present in both diseased and healthy individuals, displaying low-avidity and
 multi-reactivity, and circulating mostly as immune complexes.11 These complexes require
 dissociation prior to analysis, in order to reveal serological specificities in AD.11,12 These features
 have likely hindered consistent analyses regarding anti-Aβ antibodies, which was also the case for
 anti-alpha synuclein antibodies.10 In AD, anti-Aβ antibodies measurement led to inconsistent
 conclusions.11-14 Circulating anti-Aβ antibodies were scarcely studied in CAA.
 Our working hypothesis was that CAA and related clinical manifestations would relate to particular
 characteristics of serum anti-Aβ antibodies, including concentration, avidity, specific reactivity
 towards Aβ isoforms, and class and subclass diversity.

 Materials and methods
 Study design and participants
 This case-control study enrolled participants from Jan. 2013 to Jun. 2019, through nine French
 medical centers: CAA patients, and healthy aged controls lacking clinical and MRI features of CAA.
 Patients with CAA were classified into: CAA-he inpatients with probable or definite CAA according
 to the modified Boston criteria;15,16 CAA-ri inpatients fulfilling the criteria for non-invasive diagnosis
 of CAA-ri.17 Demographics, medical history, and cerebral MRI were recorded at admission.
 For the control group, inclusion criteria were: age > 55 years; recent MRI with normal diffusion
 sequences (transient ischemic stroke, functional neurological symptoms, or symptoms of peripheral
 origin); exclusion criteria were: cognitive decline (short Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive
 Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE-R) > 3.4); MRI-proven lobar ICH, recent ischemic stroke, or
 Fazekas grading ≥ 2 for white matter hyperintensities.
 All eligible patients who gave their consent to participate in the study were included. All serum
 aliquots were kept at -20°C until use, with a median storage duration of 19 (3–42), 16 (3–50), and 27
 (4–55) months (range) for the control, CAA-he, and CAA-ri groups, respectively.
 Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents
 The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee “Paris Ile de France V”. All participants
 representative were provided oral and written information, and gave oral or written consent to
 participate.

 Diagnoses were adjudicated by one board-certified neurologist (JC) specialized in stroke, blind to
 biological information. Cerebral lobar microhemorrhages were defined as small round foci of hypo-
 intense signal in T2*-GRE-weighted images, 10 mm or less in brain parenchyma and rated according
 to the microhemorrhages anatomical rating scale.18 Cortical superficial siderosis (cSS) was assessed
 according to the cSS multifocality scale.19
 Aβ preparations
 Synthetic (>95%) Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 peptides (Proteogenix, Schiltigheim, France) were dissolved in
 hexafluoroisopropanol, and 450 µg aliquots were evaporated in low retention tubes and stored at -20
 °C until use. Before use, lyophilized Aβ was dissolved in 10µL dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO),
 sonicated for 3 min at 300 Watts. For soluble preparations, aliquots were then mixed with 90 µL
 30mM HEPES 10eq Cu2+ pH 7.4 buffer with 10mM or 160mM NaCl for Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40,
 respectively. For fibril preparations, aliquots were then mixed with 90 µL 0.01N HCl or Aβ1-40
 coating buffer, incubated at 37°C during 72h or 15 days, for Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40, respectively.
 Multiplex ELISA for anti-Aβ antibody analyses
 Freshly prepared soluble or fibrillar Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 (hereafter termed s-Aβ40, s-Aβ42, f-Aβ40 or f-
 Aβ42) were diluted to 15 µg/mL in coating buffer (30mM HEPES 160mM or 10mM NaCl (for Aβ1–40
 and Aβ1–42, respectively) 10eq Cu2+ (for monomers) pH 7.4), distributed at 100 µL per well into
 ELISA plates (Greiner BioOne) and incubated 16 hours at 4°C. Serial dilutions of serum samples at
 1:50 to 1:12800 in 0.1M Glycine-HCl buffer pH 3.0, were left 40 minutes at 20°C for dissociation of
 immune complexes, neutralized to pH 7.4 by adding the same volume of 2xPBS 4% BSA 0.02N
 NaOH, then 100µL were immediately deposited into s-Aβ40, s-Aβ42, f-Aβ40 or f-Aβ42-coated ELISA
 plates and incubated 1h at 20°C. After eight washes with PBS 0.05% Tween-20, bound antibodies of
 each IgG subclass were detected by 16h incubation at 4°C of monoclonal anti-human IgG1, IgG2,
                                                                                                                                           6

 IgG3, or IgG4 antibodies (clones NL16, GOM2, ZG4 and RJ4, respectively). After eight washes with
 PBS 0.05% Tween-20, antibodies belonging to IgG, IgA and IgM classes and IgG subclasses were
 revealed after 1h incubation at 20°C with peroxidase-conjugated antisera (anti-mouse IgG for IgG
 subclasses, or anti-human IgG, IgA, and IgM, 1:5000 in washing buffer, Jackson ImmunoResearch
 Inc.). Washed plates were revealed with H2O2/o-phenylene-diamine substrate in 0.15 M urea buffer
 pH 5.0, the reaction stopped with 2N H2SO4, and optical densities (OD) measured at 492 nm. Non-
 specific signals obtained in uncoated wells were subtracted from overall signals retain OD relating to
 specific anti-Aβ binding. Of note, IgG2 antibodies yielded low binding to Aβ and unusable dilution
 curves as previously found in 33 AD and controls.12
 Quality management of multiplex ELISA
 Samples were randomized and analyzed blindly to minimize bias due to manipulator and inter-assay
 variability. Randomization was stratified in order to include samples from all clinical groups, so any
 experimental bias would affect all groups comparably. Pools of human sera were used as internal
 standard for inter-experiment normalization, and internal control to assess inter-assay variability.
 Results over 2.5 standard deviation (sd) for one curve parameter were considered invalid.
 Determination of dilution curve parameters
 Serum serial dilution curves follow a sigmoid-shaped signal in semi-logarithmic units, as illustrated
 on Fig 1A.20 The best fitting sigmoid curve parameters were determined by non-linear least square
 approach, following the equation:
                                                         
                                                                                  .  .
 The values of a, b, and c directly relate to sigmoid curve parameters, hence to antibody properties.
 Maximum (a) signal obtained in antibody excess relate to the number of antigen binding sites, hence
                                                                                                                                           7

 on the diversity of epitope recognition by polyclonal anti-Aβ antibodies. Titer (ln(b)/c) reflects the x-
 axis position of the curve, and depends on both concentration and avidity of the antibodies. The
 Steepness or Slope of the curve at the inflexion point (–c/4a) can vary with cooperativity phenomena
 occurring between distinct antibody binding sites. The apparent Avidity constant was calculated
 through a linearization procedure of the sigmoid curve (Fig 1B).21 In order to ensure appropriate
 goodness-of-fit of experimental data, only curves with R > 0.9 were taken into account.
 Statistical analysis
 For each individual, 96 serological variables were analyzed (Maximum, Titer, Steepness and Avidity
 for anti-soluble and fibrillar Aβ40 and Aβ42 IgG, IgA, IgM, IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4). In order to limit
 multiple comparison bias, we chose not to perform univariate analysis. Multiple logistic regression
 models were computed using stepwise variable selection. The criteria for retaining a variable into the
 model were that all variables were significantly associated with the risk of belonging to the diseased
 group (tested by the Wald’s test; p<0.05) and that introducing this variable allowed a significant
 improvement of the model against the (k-1) model, as measured by a significant drop of the residual
 variance (tested by a Likelihood Ratio test; p-value < 0.05). Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) were
 computed for each final model to ensure the absence of collinearity between variables. A VIF value
 of 1 is obtained when there is no collinearity between variables, while a VIF value > 5 witnesses high
 multicollinearity in the model. Wilcoxon’s test was used to compare the predicted response of the
 models between clinical groups. All statistical analyses were done with R version 3.6.1. The MASS
 package was used for model selection, and the beeswarm package for plots.

 Results
 Patient demographics and clinico-radiological data
 The study enrolled 105 participants: 41 healthy aged controls, 46 CAA-he patients, and 18 CAA-ri
 patients. Of note, eight patients from the CAA-he group had cSS but no ICH ; their symptoms were :
 isolated cognitive decline in 3, transient focal episodes in 4 (2 with acute subarachnoidal
 hemorrhage); asymptomatic in one. Median (range) ages were 72 (55–89), 79 (59–90), 75 (64–87)
 years old in the control, CAA-he and CAA-ri groups, respectively. Male/Female ratios were 22/18,
 24/21, and 8/9 in the control, CAA-he and CAA-ri groups, respectively. The main clinical and
 imaging findings in CAA-he and CAA-ri patients are presented in Table I.
 Quality assessment of the multiplex ELISA
 The sigmoid modeling of experimental dilution curves showed excellent overall goodness-of-fit
 (mean R² = 0.97; range stratified by antigen isoform: [0.97–0.98]; range stratified by antibody
 isotype: [0.95–0.99]). This confirmed that experimental dilution curves are appropriately described
 by the sigmoid model. Internal control mean coefficients of variation (CV) were inferior to 20% for
 all four parameters of all antibody isotypes and all Aβ isoforms (mean CV: 16%, 7%, 16%, and 12%,
 for maxima, titer, steepness, and avidity, respectively). This validated the multiplex ELISA as a
 reliable and reproducible method for assessing anti-Aβ antibody features.
 Serum anti-Aβ antibody patterns associated with CAA
 Table II presents the anti-Aβ serologic parameters associated with CAA against controls. These
 parameters are those included in the multivariable logistic regression model after stepwise variable
 selection. Fig 2A presents the predicted response resulting from this CAA-model applied to each
 individual. This predicted response is associated with the probability of presenting CAA or not, and

 is modeled using the individual anti-Aβ profile regarding parameters presented in Table 2. In this
 complex profile, a higher diversity and concentration of anti-s-Aβ40 IgG3, a higher avidity of anti-s-
 Aβ40 IgG4 and a higher steepness of anti-f-Aβ42 IgG4 were associated with an increased probability
 of belonging to the CAA group. A lower diversity of anti-s-Aβ40 IgM, a lower avidity of anti-s-Aβ42
 IgA, and a lower concentration of anti-f-Aβ42 IgG1 were also associated with an increased
 probability of belonging to the CAA group. All these variables, contributed independently to the
 model, without multicollinearity (all Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) < 1.8).
 The serological anti-Aβ antibody profile associated with CAA-he as compared to healthy aged
 controls (Table 2 and Fig 2B) also included lower diversity of anti-s-Aβ40 IgM and lower avidity of
 anti-s-Aβ42 IgA. Regarding the IgG4 isotype, CAA-he patients displayed higher concentrations of
 anti-s-Aβ40 IgG4, and lower concentrations and avidity of anti-Aβ42 IgG4, respectively. CAA-he
 patients also displayed lower avidity of anti-f-Aβ42 IgG1 as compared with healthy aged controls. Of
 note, excluding the 8 CAA-he patients that presented cSS without ICH did not change variables
 present in this model. All these variables and independently contributed to the model, without
 multicollinearity (all VIFs < 1.3).
 As found in the CAA model, CAA-ri patients (Table 2 and Fig 2C) displayed lower diversity of anti-
 s-Aβ40 IgM, as also found for CAA-he patients, but also a higher diversity of anti- s-Aβ40 IgG3, and a
 higher steepness of anti-fibrillar Aβ42 IgG4 dilution curve. Conversely, CAA-ri patients displayed a
 lower steepness of anti- s-Aβ42 IgG4 and anti-s-Aβ40 IgA. All these variables contributed
 independently to the model, without multicollinearity (all VIFs < 1.4).
 Discussion
 Analyses of blood anti-Aβ antibodies demonstrate complex serological profiles in CAA, displaying
 distinctive features in CAA-he and CAA-ri patients. This proof-of-concept study suggests: i)

 evidence of a link between anti-Aβ antibody responses and CAA; ii) existence of defined circulating
 anti-Aβ antibody species associated with distinct pathological phenotypes. In brief, clinical
 manifestations of CAA appear to relate, at least in part, to a biased natural antibody repertoire or
 abnormal responses to pathological Aβ peptide. However, at this stage, these serological profiles may
 not be used as biomarkers.
 The causal relevance of these observations remains to be elucidated. Different naturally occurring
 anti-Aβ repertoires could be susceptibility factors for developing CAA, possibly by interfering with
 the clearance of cerebral Aβ. Cerebrovascular Aβ deposits may also induce anti-Aβ auto-immune
 responses emerging from the natural antibody repertoire. Finally, such induced anti-Aβ antibody
 species might enhance CAA and/or trigger hemorrhagic or inflammatory manifestations, as
 suggested in experimental mouse models.7,8
 Although this multivariable modeling approach does not allow pathophysiological conclusions about
 the role of given anti-Aβ species in CAA, it suggests hypotheses and drives attention towards
 potentially relevant anti-Aβ features. With the notable exception of anti-fibrillar Aβ1-42 IgG4, all
 serologic parameters relating to Aβ1-42 were lower in CAA. Regarding antibodies reacting with Aβ1-
 40, our results show preferential developments of IgG3 and IgG4 antibody responses. Interestingly,
 lower diversity of anti-soluble Aβ1-40 IgM was the only common feature of CAA-he and CAA-ri
 patients. This could indicate an IgM response preferentially directed toward some particular
 pathogenic Aβ1-40 epitopes in response to Aβ1-40 cerebrovascular deposits.
 The role of antibody isotypes in anti-Aβ antibodies related CAA manifestations is elusive. In AD
 patients treated with monoclonal anti-Aβ antibodies, amyloid related imaging abnormalities with
 vasogenic edema (ARIA-E) or with hemorrhagic features (ARIA-H) were initially reported with
 antibodies of IgG1 subclass.22-24 No ARIA-E but ARIA-H were yet reported in patients receiving
                                                                                                                                        11

 anti-Aβ IgG4 (Crenezumab),25 while the existence of both remains uncertain for IgG2
 (Ponezumab)26,27 None of the monoclonal anti-Aβ antibodies used in AD immunotherapy trials was
 of the IgG3 subclass. Like IgG1, IgG3 antibodies display potent effector functions including
 complement classical pathway activation and phagocytic and cytotoxic cell activation. IgG3 were
 thought to be more pathogenic than other IgG subclasses in anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody
 (ANCA)-associated vasculitis.28
 Lobar ICH, MH and cSS were also reported in active immunotherapy trial CAD106, designed for
 eliciting Aβ-specific antibodies without T-cell response. Lobar ICH occurred in a patient without
 anti-Aβ IgG response to CAD106, but his anti-Aβ IgM status was not reported.29 It is worth noting
 that in ANCA-associated vasculitis, the presence of transient but recurrent IgM-ANCA is associated
 with a higher severity mainly due to acute hemorrhagic pulmonary manifestations.30
 The main risks factors for CAA are age, coincidental Alzheimer’s disease, and ApoE genotypes, with
 controversy regarding the respective roles of ε2 and ε4 alleles.31 We accounted for age and cognitive
 decline by selecting aged healthy controls without cognitive decline, and CAA patients with normal
 MMSE. One potential limitation is that, due to unavailable material, ApoE genotypes could not be
 evaluated in this study. However, used diagnostic criteria for CAA-he and CAA-ri are independent of
 the ApoE genotype. Part of the serologic diversity might relate to ApoE genotypes, since both ε232,33
 and ε434 alleles have been linked to more severe CAA, with vasculopathies and hemorrhagic
 phenotypes. This question should be addressed in further studies.
 In previous studies, serum anti-Aβ antibodies were mostly analyzed in the context of Alzheimer’s
 disease, with various results reported by different authors using distinct methods.12-14
 Neuropathological CAA is virtually present in all patients with AD pathology.35 However, lobar
 microbleeds evoking CAA are present in only about 20% AD patients36 while lobar ICH and
                                                                                                                                        12

 spontaneous manifestations similar to CAA-ri are rare in AD. This may be explained by the distinct
 CAA neuropathological phenotypes in AD and in patients with CAA clinical manifestations.37
 Whether AD patients with and without cerebral microbleed would present with different anti-Aβ
 serological signatures as compared to CAA-he and CAA-ri patients is thus likely and will be
 addressed in further studies.
 Anti-Aβ antibodies circulate mostly as immune complexes,11 but whether these complexes include
 circulating Aβ, cross-reactive proteins, and/or anti-idiotype antibodies is not known. As previously
 performed by others,11-12,38 we used acidic dissociation of serum samples followed by
 extemporaneous neutralization to analyze all circulating anti-Aβ antibodies regardless of their free or
 bound state. We used high purity synthetic Aβ preparations and appropriate blank controls to ensure
 binding specificity. Of note, given the low specific signal obtained with non-dissociated samples
 once the background is subtracted, dilution curve analysis could not have been performed on non-
 dissociated samples. That anti-Aβ antibodies circulate mostly as immune complexes also raises
 questions regarding plasma Aβ levels measurements. Contradictory results exist on circulating Aβ
 levels in CAA.39,40 The circulating levels of free Aβ should depend on the concentrations and
 affinities of circulating anti-Aβ antibodies, and it is possible that the experimental conditions in
 which Aβ measurements are performed cannot fully circumvent Aβ masking by circulating anti-Aβ
 antibodies.
 In conclusion, this correlative proof-of-concept study demonstrates distinct serum anti-Aβ antibody
 patterns in CAA and its hemorrhagic and inflammatory manifestations. Larger prospective and
 experimental studies could elucidate the triggering role of anti-Aβ antibodies in spontaneous or
 immunotherapy-induced CAA manifestations, and provide appropriate biomarkers.
