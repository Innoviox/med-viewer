   Abstract
   How significant are school holidays for the Covid-19 crisis? In this ecological study, we
   analyse the association between summer school holidays and the weekly growth rate in
   SARS-CoV-2 infections in 401 German districts. In Germany school holidays are coordinated
   between states and spread out in order to reduce the number and length of traffic jams on
   motorways. We employ a district fixed effects Chow-type structural break model
   specification in which we test whether the holiday season as well as the period of two
   weeks after holidays end result in a statistically significantly higher infection growth rate
   than the period of two weeks before holidays start, our presumed counterfactual. We also
   allow the effect to vary week-by-week and by states. We find that between 30 and 50
   percent of the growth rate in new infections in Germany can be attributed to the holiday
   season. A significant increase in the growth of new infections begins approximately four
   weeks after holidays begin – that is, shortly after the first wave of holiday-makers return.
   The effect becomes stronger the further holidays proceed and does not revert back to
   normal in the two weeks after the end of holidays. States in the West of Germany tend to
   experience stronger effects than those in the East. Part of this finding is explained by
   another result, namely that we find significant interaction effects of school holidays with per
   capita taxable income and the share of foreign residents in a district’s population.

   1. Introduction
   When the first tourist charter flight from Germany since the closure of borders in Europe in
   March arrived in Mallorca on June 16, locals applauded the 189 passengers on board for
   their bravery. Fast forward three months and the applause for the return of tourism has
   been muted across Europe by the re-emergence of high and rising infection numbers in
   tourist destinations and the home countries of returning travellers (McKee 2020). In fact,
   many observers believe that international holiday travels present the root cause of the
   coronavirus pandemic’s growing dynamic. Germany’s Federal minister of health, Jens-Peter
   Spahn, recommended a simple remedy, namely to go on vacation within Germany.1
   Just how significant are holiday-seasons and holiday-related travels for the Covid-crisis?
   According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) roughly 30-40 percent of all new infections can
   potentially be linked to a holiday trip abroad (RKI 2020).2 What the RKI observes is that 30 to
   40 percent of the known new infected people had been abroad shortly before they were
   tested positive for Sars-CoV-2. Of course, the RKI researchers cannot know for sure where
   the infection actually occurred but their presumption may seem plausible given the timing
   of events. This is particularly true for those positively tested individuals that had to
   undertake a test either at the airport itself or within 72 hours after arrival because they
   returned from an area deemed to be a high risk, i.e. virus hotspot, area. However, for the
   same reason one has to keep in mind that the share of infections related to foreign travel is
   likely to be biased upwards because returning travellers from high-risk areas were obliged

   to be tested even if they showed no symptoms, while the people that had stayed in
   Germany were not usually not systematically tested unless they showed symptoms. In other
   words, the share of tested returning travellers was likely to be higher than the share of
   tested non-travellers, and this should bias the number of travel-related cases among all
   positive tests upwards.
   While the debate in Germany focuses on holiday-makers returning from a vacation spent
   abroad, holidays can trigger higher infections even if travellers do not go abroad. Even if all
   holiday travellers had stayed in Germany, the spread of the virus would have been likely to
   accelerate because of the changed social behaviour during holidays (Ewing et al. 2017;
   Eames et al. 2011). Many holiday-makers have more and more intense social interactions,
   often to people that they do not know (Ewing et al. 2017). Mobility also reduces the health
   agencies’ ability to successfully trace contacts of people that are infected with Sars-CoV-2
   (Akian et al. 2020). These additional risks are hardly limited to international travels, it is a
   holiday hazard. In this paper, we thus broaden the perspective and focus on the extent to
   which school holidays have triggered an increase in the growth rate of weekly new
   infections, including but not limited to holiday-related travel abroad.
   To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to estimate the association between
   summer school holidays and new Sars-CoV-2 infections. We employ an ecological analysis of
   variation in infection growth rates across German districts – there are no data at the
   individual level. Keeping the well-known limits of any ecological study in mind, Germany
   provides an excellent case study for the analysis of the association between school holidays
   and the growth in infections. We exploit a particular feature of the system of school
   holidays in Germany, namely that they are not uniform across the Federal Republic but vary
                                                                   3

   in their start and therefore also their end date from state to state in a pre-determined way.3
   This idiosyncratic feature allows us to disentangle the effect that holiday-related travel has
   on new infections in German districts located in states that are or have been on holiday
   from the general upward trend in new infections in Germany. Our research design also
   allows us to capture any increase in infections caused by holiday-related travel within
   Germany, whereas the RKI’s approach only looks at those who went abroad.
   We test three hypotheses. First, the growth rate of infections systematically increases in
   districts with school holidays. Second, the growth rate of new infections increases over time
   as the school holidays proceed and does not revert back down to what it was before the
   start of holidays in the two weeks after holidays end. Third, the effect of summer school
   holidays and the two-week period after the end of holidays on the growth rate in infections
   is larger in districts that are richer and that have a larger share of foreigners amongst its
   resident population since richer people are more likely to go on holiday and more likely to
   go on holiday abroad and foreign citizens are likely to want to visit their home country
   during the holiday season.
   Our estimates suggest that at least 30 percent of the new infections that occurred in
   Germany in all states during their summer school holidays can be attributed to summer
   school holidays on infections, but this effect goes to 50 percent towards the end of the
   holiday seasons and in the more affluent states and districts. We find substantively larger
   than average effects in the Western German states of Lower Saxony, Bavaria, and Baden-

   Württemberg and substantively lower than average effects in the Eastern German states
   Saxony-Anhalt, Thüringen, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The size of the
   effect is thus generally consistent with the RKI calculations.
   Our findings contribute to various strands of the social science literature on Covid-19 and
   similar epidemics. First and most directly, our research is related to the growing number of
   studies interested in the social determinants of Sars-CoV-2 infections. Of course, as we
   explain in the next section, holidays do not directly cause a transmission of a virus, but they
   facilitate behaviours which are more conducive to transmissions than other behaviours and
   therefore make it easier for a virus to strive and spread (van Bevel et al. 2020, Jarvis et al.
   2020). Second, our findings are consistent with studies that have simulated data to project a
   dampening effect of travel restrictions on the speed with which Sars-CoV-2 spreads
   (Chinazzi et al. 2020; Anzai et al. 2020; Devi 2020). We provide indirect evidence for the
   predictions based on these models using observed infection numbers. Third, our findings
   are broadly in line with analyses of infectious diseases other than Covid-19 (Yu et al. 2012;
   Nichol et al. 2010). Most closely related to our results, Poggensee et al. (2010) estimate that
   during the summer roughly 60 percent of infections with H1N1 influenza were related to
   travel. Like us, Poggensee and co-authors relate the effect of holidays to holiday-related
   travels. We find a somewhat smaller holiday effect, but this could be due to conceptual
   differences: while our data only count individuals tested positive for Sars-CoV-2 infections,
   Poggensee et al. (2010: 2) accept all individuals with “Influenza-like illness (…) defined as
   acute onset of respiratory symptoms, and fever, and cough, and headache or musculo-
   skeletal pain” as H1N1 cases.

   2. Background: School Holidays and the Rise in Sars-CoV-2 Infections
   The most straightforward argument against the hypothesis that holiday travels to foreign
   places increase infections back home is simple: if a holiday-maker travels to a destination
   that has fewer active cases per capita than her home area, the probability of an infection
   declines, all other things equal. Yet, not only did Germany have lower infection rates than
   many foreign holiday destinations. More importantly, all other things are not equal and, for
   at least three reasons, we would expect that holiday-related travels increase infections
   regardless of the relative difference in infection rates between Germany and other
   countries.
   First, the process of travelling may in itself increase the risk of an infection. If the traveller
   journeys to an airport, train or bus station, waits around for boarding and then boards a
   plane, train or bus, a potentially crowded indoor space with imperfect ventilation, the
   probability of transmission through aerosols increases – small exhaled droplets that may
   contain the virus (Moravska and Cao 2020). The evidence on infections during flights and
   train rides is rather mixed. In unpublished work, Hu et al. (2020) report that the probability
   of an infection while sitting within 3 rows and 5 columns from an infected passenger is low
   on average (0.32 percent) but can be as high as 10.3 percent. Likewise, Schwartz et. al.
   (2020: E410) find no contagion on a (single) flight with infected passengers. They suggest
   that “studies of airplane transmission are commonly biased by contacts sharing exposure
   risks before boarding the air-craft.” However, the absence of evidence of an effect is not
   evidence of absence of such an effect. As Gonne and Hubert (2020) argue, travel restrictions
   are surprisingly easy to implement, but unsurprisingly difficult to access. Moreover, though
   very few infections have been demonstrably associated with trains and planes, there is at
                                                                   6

   least some evidence that public transportation has contributed to the spread of the virus in
   early stages of the pandemic (Harris 2020; Fathi-Kazerooni et al. 2020). For example, Harris
   (2020) has compellingly argued that the underground public transportation system
   contributed to the spread of the virus in New York City during the early days of the
   pandemic. All in all, however, we would presume this first factor to be a relatively minor one
   relative to the other two.
   Second, people who go on vacation do not follow the same daily routines as they do at
   home. They are less likely to follow social distancing norms, partly because they follow
   holiday routines and partly because social control from family and friends declines. Migrant
   workers visiting their home countries often ignore rules of social distancing when visiting
   friends and family (Leung et al. 2020; Farias and Pilati 2020). It seems that long-established
   social courtesy norms are often stronger than relatively new and untrained social distancing
   rules, partly because of the misperception that family and friends do not pose a serious
   risk.4 For migrant workers a summer holiday usually implies family visits, exchange of gifts,
   and parties. Likewise, tourists spend more time on leisure activities and visit bars and
   restaurants more often than they would at home. In an interview with the Time magazine,
   Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
   Medicine, told journalist Madelaine Roach that the rise in new infections was “most likely”
   triggered by “tourists in crowded bars, restaurants, and nightclubs.”5 There exists plenty of
   video and photo footage that shows tourists violating social distancing norms. What appears
   4
         The relevance of social capital for adherence to social distancing norms is now well established
         (Borgonovi et al. 2020; Bartscher et al. 2020; Papageorge et al. 2020; see also Pampel et al.
         2010). What is missing, though, are analyses of how a change in the social environment
         influences social distancing behaviour.

   to be lacking, however, is systematic research on the behavioural-related differences of the
   same people at home and during their holidays as it could be that the same people shown
   on the footage also violate social distancing norms back home. In a computational model on
   H1N1 influenza, Shi et al. (2010) find that social gatherings and travels increase infections
   close to the peak of a pandemic, but have little effect when the number of active infections
   per capita is low. While this finding may be plausible for influenza where virtually all
   contagious people show symptoms, it does not need to hold for a virus that can be
   transmitted from asymptomatic infected people as is the case with Sars-CoV-2. We
   therefore find it plausible that holidays reduce the willingness and ability of people to
   adhere to social distancing norms.
   Third, holiday travellers have more social interactions with people that they do not normally
   physically interact with and/or they do not know. Holiday travel inevitably implies
   interacting with more strangers or faintly acquainted individuals than back home. As a
   consequence, infected people will usually not be able to name their recent close contacts
   after they have been diagnosed with the virus. What makes matters worse is that tracing
   apps are incompatible across European countries. Hence, with holiday travel-related
   transmissions, contact tracing becomes prohibitively difficult: travellers are unlikely to
   identify many of their close contacts and technology will also be of little help since contact
   tracing apps do not work across European borders. Thus, even if the behaviour of holiday
   travellers were not to increase the spread of Sars-CoV-2 as such, the declining ability to stop
   the spread through contact tracing measures should eventually lead to an increase in
   infections.
   In sum, holiday-related travels increase infections not necessarily because of the act of
                                                                   8

   travelling itself though this might also contribute. Rather, travelling increases infections
   because tourism and family visits abroad have a profound effect on the number, intensity
   and nature of social interactions and significantly reduce the ability to trace social contacts.
   This logic implies that the odds of catching an infectious disease may increase even if
   travellers vacation in a region of their home country or another country with a lower
   infection rate. Likewise, though, the risk becomes larger the higher the rate of infection in
   the traveller’s destination.
   We use these theoretical considerations to test three hypotheses. First, school holidays
   have a positive effect on the infection growth rate in the home location of travellers.
   Second, given that there is a delay until holiday travellers return home, the later parts of any
   given holiday season should have a larger effect than its earlier parts. Empirical evidence
   suggests (Stiftung für Zukunfsfragen 2020; Gokovali et al. 2007) that the average lengths of
   holiday stay of German tourists is about 12-14 days. Therefore, one should expect that
   infections start to rise roughly 2 to 3 weeks after the beginning of the school holidays. In
   other words, the longer the holidays last, the stronger the increase in the infection growth
   rate. Reinforcing this logic, infections rise in practically all holiday travel destinations, both
   within and outside Germany, thus increasing the risk of catching the virus as the holiday
   season proceeds. Third, school holidays will have a stronger effect on the infection growth
   rate in districts that are richer on average and in which a larger share of the resident
   population are foreigners. Richer people are more likely to go on holiday, more likely to go
   on holiday abroad (where infection rates tend to be higher than in Germany) and foreign
   citizens are likely to return to their home country for family visits (possibly in addition to
   taking other holidays).

   3. Data and Estimation
   Our dependent variable is the weekly percentage growth rate in the number of infections in
   a German district. Infection data by district are sourced from the RKI website (www.rki.de).
   Our sample covers 401 districts with the temporal dimension drawn from the period star-
   ting with the weekly growth rate to Wednesday 10 June (week 23) and terminating with the
   weekly growth rate to Wednesday 23 September (week 38).6 We deliberately define the
   week to end in a Wednesday rather than Sunday or Monday to avoid noise from occasional
   corrections made on Mondays or Tuesdays for underreporting over the weekend. For each
   district, we analyse the period ranging from two weeks prior to the beginning of holidays to
   two weeks after the end of the holidays. Our panel thus has N=401 districts and T=10 weeks
   equals 4010 observations. In Germany, the dates of the summer school holidays are chosen
   by each of the 16 states in close consultation with each other. The intention is to reduce the
   probability and length of traffic jams on Germany’s crowded motorways during the summer
   months. In each state, schools close for roughly six weeks. In 2020, the summer school
   holiday season began on June 22 in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and ended September 9 in
   Baden-Württemberg. Hence, Germany spreads the holiday season over almost 13 weeks.
   The average weekly growth rate of infections in the sample across all German districts is
   2.70 percent with a standard deviation of 3.48 percent. For an average district, the
   incidence rate would double roughly every 26 weeks. In Germany as a whole, the number of
   new infections had been stable at around 500 per day until the end of July. In August, the
   number of daily infections begun to rise reaching approximately 1,500 new daily infections

         twelve districts of Berlin are aggregated to one single city state district.

   at the end of August and about 2,000 daily new infections at the end of September.
   The upward trajectory in infections in Germany coincides with the summer school holiday
   seasons. It is unlikely, however, that the return of rising infection numbers has been
   determined by school holidays alone. To isolate the predicted effects from other influences,
   we include a lagged dependent variable in the model that accounts for the common trend in
   the data (Engle and Kozicki 1993; Vahin and Engle 1993; Plümper et al. 2005; Ding and Li
   2019).7 This is a conservative research strategy since part of this trend was most likely
   caused by returning holiday-makers. However, it is impossible to provide a precise estimate
   of the influence of holidays on the trend because holiday travel was allowed in all states and
   all districts at all times, not just during school holidays. In fact, it is a limitation of our
   research design that we can only capture holiday-related travel triggered by school holidays.
   Families with children of school-age in particular are dependent on school holidays for their
   holiday travel and the same holds for the employees of firms that close down for company
   holidays over the summer. Thus, the majority of holiday travels will take place during school
   holidays but certainly not all of it, which potentially biases downwards our estimate of the
   effect of holiday-related travel on Sars-CoV-2 infection.
   We include district fixed effects (Allison 2009) to absorb any variation across districts that is
   time-invariant such as demographic, geographic and socio-economic factors that render
   some districts more generally exposed to the pandemic than others. Since potential control
   variables come from annual data, they are time-invariant for the panel structure we have.
   These time-invariant variables are perfectly collinear with the district unit effects and we

         Results are similar if we use an alternative approach for taking out the common trend, such as
         an autoregressive model.

   therefore cannot simultaneously include control variables and estimate a district fixed
   effects model. We cluster standard errors on districts. If we additionally apply two-way
   clustering of standard errors also by states results are hardly affected (results not reported).
   In table 1 we report results on a dummy variable that is set to 1 if a district is located in a
   state in which schools are on summer holidays in that week as well as a dummy variable for
   the two-week period after the holidays. This model can be interpreted as a Chow-type
   model (Chow 1962; Dufour 1982) in which the dummy variables estimates whether there is
   a structural break between the period before holidays and the holiday period as well as the
   period before holidays and the period of two weeks after the holidays. We find that summer
   school holiday weeks are on average predicted to increase the infection growth rate by 0.72
   percentage points relative to the period before holidays, consistent with our first
   hypothesis. This equates to 27.3 percent of the weekly growth rate in Germany during the
   entire holiday season.
   We also find that the growth rate in infections in the two-week period after the holiday
   season ends is statistically significantly higher than either the pre-holiday period but also the
   holiday period (p<0.01). This is caused by late returners from holidays, the incubation time
   which is estimated to be 2 weeks for some cases, time it takes from infection to being
   counted as infected by the RKI and by the further spread of travel-related infections in
   Germany by those returnees who infect others either unwittingly (in the case of
   asymptomatic individuals) or before their self-isolation. This suggests that we should see
   holiday effects from roughly week 3 of the holidays to at least 2 weeks after the holiday
   ends, but of course it is highly likely that holidays have a persistent and lingering effect on
   infection rates that last much longer than the holidays. Moreover, our findings suggest that,
                                                                   12

   as expected, the holiday effect is not constant over the period of holidays so that the effect
   reported in model 1, which pools all holiday weeks together, masks that the effect is likely
   to vary across the holiday period and increase over time as holidays proceed. To test our
   second hypothesis, model 2 therefore allows the effect of holidays and the 2-week period
   thereafter to differ week-by-week. As expected, we find that the effect increases in later
   weeks of the school holidays.

   The effect is essentially zero in the first two week not least because of the lag caused the
   incubation period. The effect turns positive in week three and becomes statistically
   significant from week four onwards and then increases to 1.91 percentage points in week 6.
   The coefficients of the first and the second week after school holidays finish show that the
   increases in infection growth brought about by the school holidays do not disappear but
   essentially remain constant.
   In model 3, reported in table 2, we revert back to the simple Chow-type structural break
   model with two dummy variables but allow the structural breaks to vary state-by-state. We
   exclude the two states of Hamburg and Berlin since both are counted as consisting of only
   one district in our data, which would result in unreliable estimates. Table 2, in which we sort
   states by the point estimate of the holiday period dummy variable, shows large variation in
   the holiday effect on infection growth rates across districts in different German states.
   Overall, we find that richer states are more likely to show relatively large effects, and we
   find that the increase in infections associated with the holiday season is larger in the
   Western German states than in the Eastern German states. Looking state by state, we find a
   statistically significant effect of either the holiday period or the two-week period after the
   end of holidays or of both in 12 of the 16 states.
   Only Thüringen, Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg, all located in the East, and North Rhine-
   Westphalia show no statistically significant effects. The three Eastern German states have
   low and slowly but linearly rising growth rates in Infection numbers and therefore no
   significant holiday effect.

   In contrast, North Rhine-Westphalia had high infection rates and growth rates above 4
   percent already before the holidays begun due to super-spreader events in a
   slaughterhouse of the Tönnies company in the districts of Gütersloh and Warendorf with no
   further acceleration during the holiday period. These events have reduced the estimate of
   holiday-related growth in infections for this state because the strong decline of infections in
   these two districts after containment measures were put in place locally compensates for

   the holiday-related increase in the growth rate of infections in all other districts of North
   Rhine-Westphalia. In fact, if we drop the two districts of Gütersloh and Warendorf from the
   estimations then both coefficients of the holiday and post-holiday periods become
   significantly positive for this state.
   Figure 1a and 1b show cumulative infection numbers and the growth rate in infections for
   the states of Bavaria, the richest German state bar the two city states of Bremen and
   Hamburg, and Saxony-Anhalt, the state with the lowest average per capita income. As
   Model 3 has shown, the holiday season was associated with a significant increase in
   infections in Bavaria, while we did not find a significant increase in infections relative to the
   trend in Saxony-Anhalt. Figures 1a and 1b support these findings from our regression
   analysis. The vertical lines depict the first and the last day of school holidays, the blue line
   represents the cumulative number of known infections (left scale) and the bars display the
   weekly growth rate of these infections calculated for each day with respect to the past
   seven days. Even without econometric controls for the trend in the data, one can see a
   structural break in Bavaria’s infection dynamics and the absence of such a structural break
   in Saxony-Anhalt’s infection rates.
   Bavaria’s growth rate in infections is slowly increasing from about 0.4 percent on day 167 to
   about 1 percent on the day its summer holidays started. Two weeks later, when holiday-
   makers began to return, the growth rate still stood at 1.06 percent (day 226), but quickly
   rose to 3.87 percent on day 237. We find so such effect for Summer-Anhalt. This state had a
   short outbreak of infections in mid-June, with the infection growth rate then falling to below
   1 percent and then starting to climb almost linearly over the summer, with no obvious
   structural break triggered by the beginning of the school holidays.

   Saxony-Anhalt and Bavaria differ in many respects. Bavaria is richer, more industrial, more
   urbanized, and it also hosts a larger share of foreign residents. In table 3, we allow the effect
   of summer school holidays and the two-week period after holidays to be conditioned by one
   or both of two variables, namely by average taxable income in a district as well as by the
   share of foreigners amongst a district’s residents. We have selected these variables because
   they are likely to determine the number of holiday-related travels. Richer people are more
   likely to go on vacation and go on vacation abroad and foreign residents will be keen to visit

   database of the German statistical office.8 These variables are time-invariant for our sample,
   therefore we cannot estimate coefficients for these variables as such in a model with district
   fixed effects. However, we can estimate the conditioning effect of these variables on the
   time-varying holiday variables.

   conditioning variables are correlated at r = 0.44 with each other. In model 6 we include
   interaction effects with both taxable income per capita and the share of foreigners amongst
   a district’s residents. The conditioning effects are rather similar in model 6 as they were in
   models 4 and 5, except the one between the post-holiday dummy variable and taxable
   income per capita is no longer statistically significant.
   4. Conclusion
   Many believe that holiday-related travels, particularly to foreign places, have been at the
   root of rising infection numbers in Germany. We have analysed the association between
   summer school holidays and the weekly growth rate of Sars-CoV-2 infections in German
   districts. Our findings lend support to the widely shared belief: We find a statistically
   significant and substantively important increase in the growth rate of infections due to the
   holiday season and the two-week period thereafter. Disaggregating the effect week-by-
   week, we find that the effect increases over the holiday period, becoming statistically
   significant from week 4 onwards and not reverting back to the growth rate from before the
   holiday period in the two weeks after holidays end.
   While infection numbers would probably have gone up in the counterfactual case of no
   summer holidays because large parts of the population have become tired of anti-
   coronavirus policies and social distancing, this article has provided evidence that about 30
   percent of new infections were associated with school holidays. For example, model 1
   predicts that the average summer school holiday week increases the growth rate in
   infections by 0.72 percentage points relative to the period before holidays. This equates to
   27.3 percent of the average growth rate in Germany during the entirely holiday season. Yet,
                                                                   19

   this is an average across time and across space. As Model 2 suggests, in week 6 of the
   holidays the growth rate in infections is predicted to be 1.91 percentage points higher than
   it was during the two weeks before holidays begun. This translates to approximately 50
   percent of the average growth rate in infections.
   Our findings also go beyond simply confirming the widely held belief that holidays increased
   infections. We have explored how the effect differs across German states and have shown
   that the average effect also holds for most of the German states, if to varying degrees.
   There are statistically significant structural breaks in the growth rate of infections in at least
   10 of the 14 German states9 with more than one district in our dataset. The stronger effects
   take place in the Western German states. In fact, those without a statistically significant
   structural break are all located in Eastern Germany with the exception of North Rhine-
   Westphalia which is however an outlier due to a very large local outbreak before the holiday
   season though spreading of course beyond the two districts immediately affected. Two
   main reasons for this heterogeneity across German states are that the states with a stronger
   effect consist of districts that tend to be both richer and have a larger share of foreign
   residents amongst their population, both of which spurs holiday-related travel.
   Corroborating this, we have shown that the higher is per capita income and the higher the
   share of foreigners in a district, the larger the increases in the growth rate of infections. This
   would result in higher than average effects for Hamburg, Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria and
   Hesse, all of which are dominated by districts with above average income and an above
   average resident share of foreigners, and lower than average effects for each single state in

         If we account for the superspreading event in two slaughterhouses in Westphalia in 11 out of 14 districts.

   East Germany with the exception of Berlin, which are all relatively poor (by German
   standards) and have a low share of foreigners amongst their residents.
   These holiday effects are not just substantial, they were also predictable. Of course, it would
   not have been realistic for either the German federal government or state governments to
   implement let alone enforce prohibitions on holiday-related travel. However, neither
   Germany as a whole nor the states systematically kept reminding travellers of the
   importance of maintaining social distancing and keeping track of close contacts. Doing so
   may have been futile anyway but they did not prepare to deal with the predictable rapid
   increase in infections either. What they could and arguably should have done was to
   significantly drive up testing facilities to compensate for the increase in infections and the
   reduced contract tracing capabilities. Eventually, Germany did drive up testing capacities,
   but this came too late to prevent a significant increase in the growth rate of infections. We
   contend that this in a second wave of infections starting earlier with higher growth rates in
   infections than would have otherwise happened.
