       Abstract
                  This study uses mobility statistics—a relatively novel data source consisting of smartphone
       location data—combined with business census data for the eight Japanese prefectures with the highest
       COVID-19 infection rates to study the effect of lockdown measures on the effective transmission rate
       of the virus. Based on data for the first wave of infections in Japan, we found that reductions targeting
       the hospitality industry were more effective than restrictions on general business activities.
       Specifically, we found that to fully converge the pandemic (that is, to reduce the effective reproduction
       number to one or less for all the days), a 40-67% reduction in weekly mobility is required, depending
       on the region. A lesser goal, 80% of days with one or less observed transmission, a 14-61% reduction
       in weekly mobility is needed.
       Introduction
                  Many countries have suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic and have experienced severe
       economic impacts due to the restrictions on socio-economic activities. GDP losses have been
       significant (e.g., -7.9% in Japan during the second quarter of 2020 [1]), and unemployment numbers
       are increasing. Several countries have managed to restart socio-economic activities close to pre-
       pandemic levels, but most have suffered a second wave of the pandemic.

                  The conditions of first, second, and higher-round waves can differ because individual or
       organizational countermeasures (e.g., masks, hand washing, antiseptic solutions, and partitioning)
       have advanced. However, analyzing the infection risks and degree of lockdown/voluntary restriction
       of socio-economic activities in the first wave, the currently available data, is meaningful for creating
       better activity restriction policies.
                  In this sense, mobility statistics, which have become recently available through smartphone
       devices, are a powerful tool for understanding regional overviews of socio-economic activities. For
       example, Google Mobility Report [2] provides population statistics for retail and recreation, grocery
       and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential areas all over the world. Engle et al.
       [3] used GPS locational data for 94,116 observations in 3,142 U.S. counties from 2/24/2020 to
       3/25/2020 and found that a rise in local infection rate from 0% to 0.003% is associated with a 2.31%
       reduction in mobility. Yabe et al. [4] employed 200,000 anonymized mobile phone users in Tokyo and
       concluded that by April 15th (one week into the state of emergency), human mobility behavior
       decreased by approximately 50%.
                  Our approach also utilizes mobility data (hourly and 500m grid scale populations all over
       Japan) considering its powerful ability to capture the conditions of staying home during the pandemic
       crisis. The focus of the study is two major exploratory data analyses. First, we focus on the question,
       what types of mobility-restriction measures are correlated with infection risks? For this purpose, recent
       business census data at a 500m grid scale is combined with mobility statistics and the effective
       reproduction number (how many people are infected by one infected person, denoted by R(t)). The
       second focus question is, to what degree do we need to restrict our (daily) travel to reduce the pandemic
       crisis?
       Data set and approach
                  In this study, three different types of statistics are utilized: the number of infected people [5],
       mobility statistics [6], and business census data from Japan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs and
       Communications (MIC) [7]. The number of infected people is recorded on the date that the infections
       are confirmed by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW). Here, we focused on the
       eight prefectures where the number of infections was more than 500 people by May 31, 2020. We then
       prepared the associated data sets for these eight prefectures.
                  Fig 1 illustrates the time series of the number of infected people in the eight target
       prefectures. Tokyo had the most infected people, and the second largest city, Osaka, follows.
       Explosions of infections can be seen from the end of March. It is assumed that people reduced their
       restriction levels during the holidays before this large wave came. April 7th is the day the emergency
       statement was issued by the Japanese Government, after which the first wave of the pandemic

       gradually abated. The effective reproduction number can be calculated from this data and the serial
       interval distribution (time between successive infections from one person to another). We employed
       Cori et al. [8] to estimate the effective reproduction number based on the serial interval distribution
       provided by Nishiura et al. [9].

                  NTT docomo is one of the largest carriers in Japan, and it holds 37.4 % of all mobile phone
       contracts in Japan [10]. Populations of people ages 15 to 79 are counted with the following rule for
       target hourly duration: If a person stays within the grid for 15 minutes during a target hour, then 1/4 is
       added to the population. Every 15 minutes of stay, this rule is applied. Based on the duration of each
       person’s stay in a grid, either 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, or 1 is added to the population of the grid. The mobility
       data are not raw data, but are magnified based on the carrier’s, NTT docomo, share in each region.
                  Fig 2 depicts the two different timings for the mobility statistics in Tokyo: from 15:00-16:00
       on March 13 (Friday), a relatively dense population is observed, while in the same time period on Apr
       23 (Friday), the population became smaller in the center of Tokyo. The total number of people
       observed in the grids during the time period in March is 12,943,780 people1, while 12,128,864 people
       were counted in April. Reductions are seen in inflows from other prefectures and abroad as well as in
       inflows from residential areas to the center of the prefecture.

                   The last statistic introduced is the 2016 economic census for businesses by the MIC [7].
       The statistics include the number of employees in over 100 business sectors, and it is aggregated in a
       500m grid scale. By using the mobility statistics and business census, we use the following criterion
       as a measure of potential contacts in the business and commercial districts. This criterion should have
       a strong (negative) correlation to the level of stay home activity. The measure of potential contacts at
       the business and commercial districts is defined as
                                                       ∑   ∈  ∑   ∈                    ,

       time t. If people are crowded in business and commercial areas, where the number of employees is
       large, the value of the measure becomes large. In the analysis, we investigate two cases:                          as
       the total employees in all business sectors and as the total employees in all hospitality sectors
       (wholesale and retail, hotel and restaurant, living related and personal services, amusement, education,
       and medical and healthcare sectors).
       Results and discussion
                   First, the value of the parameter for Equation (1) is determined by maximizing the
       correlation between the PC index and R(t) for two cases of                            . R(t) is estimated as a weekly
       average before t (i.e., R(t) represents the number from day t-6 to t). Because the estimates of R(t) in
       the first few weeks have a wide confidence interval due to the small number of incidences, we set the
       target period to the days from March 15 to May 31, 2020.
                   Fig 3 describes the Peasron correlation coefficients between PC and R(t) at different
       parameter scales         . PC is also estimated as a weekly average because it shows generally high
       correlation with R(t). The correlation indices are estimated for each prefecture first and then averaged
       among the eight prefectures. From this figure, the correlation coefficients are generally better when
       employees in the hospitality sector are selected as the weight of PC. This indicates that infections tend
       to occur in the hospitality sector. In the case in which the hospitality sector is used for Equation (1),
         =8 performs the best. The reason behind this needs to be investigated further, but the parameter
       values may represent the frequency and time duration of contacts among people in a grid.

       measure of potential contacts in the business and commercial district at different power scales,

                   Fig 4 plots the daily time series of the measure of potential contacts and R(t) in the eight
       prefectures. In the figure for Hokkaido, the target days after March 15th are highlighted for a reference.
       In many prefectures, the potential contacts decrease considerably during April and the beginning of
       May, but gradually start to return to pre-pandemic conditions at the end of May. The state of
       emergency declared by the central government ended on May 16th in Hokkaido and on May 31st in all
       the other prefectures, but people gradually restarted their activities probably because the atmosphere
       of emergency was alleviated after many of the other prefectures ended emergency actions.

        Fig 4. Effective reproduction number and measure of potential contact in the eight prefectures
                   Based on the estimates of PC and R(t) described in Fig 4, the required mobility restriction
       levels can be calculated for converging the pandemic. That is, the threshold value of PC can achieve
       R(t)     1. If the threshold value of PC is set as PC’, then PC′ /PC gives the relative ratio of the
       weighted geometric mean of N’(s,t) and N(s,t), where N’(s,t) is the required population at grid s at
       time t and one of the solutions to achieve the threshold value, assuming N(s,t) is population at normal
       period. Our study adopts average N(s,t) in February, 2020. Fig 5 shows the estimated population
       (mobility) restriction levels (N’(s,t)/N(s,t)) to ensure achievement of R(t)                   1 in each prefecture.
       Because this is the geometric mean scale weighted by employees in the hospitality sector, PC’ can be
       more easily achieved if the rate of people is reduced more in places where the hospitality sector is
       agglomerated.
                   From the figure, Osaka requires the largest reduction (67%), followed by Tokyo. This result
       can be naturally interpreted as these prefectures are the largest in Japan, and the population in the
       hospitality sector tends to be large. As shown in Fig 4, the scale of potential contacts in these
       prefectures is more than 10 times larger than the scale in other prefectures. Kanagawa, Hyogo, and
       Fukuoka also require high restriction levels on visits to the hospitality sector. Among these prefectures,
       Hyogo is a less populated prefecture, and the index of PC is low. Population characteristics are
       generally reflected in the low value of R(t) in Hyogo, but a large restriction on visits to the hospitality
       sector is required to guarantee R(t)            1. Another index, such as R(t)           1 with an 80% chance, may
       be appropriate to capture the relationships between PC and an average low value of R(t). Hokkaido,
       Saitama, and Chiba may be classified into the third group, where the required restrictions are not so
       strict. In these prefectures, Chiba maintained relatively high values of R(t) at the end of March, but
       effectively reduced it through small population reductions in hospitality sector areas.

                   Based on the discussion above, in order to better understand the case of Hyogo, another

       index “R(t)        1 for 80% of days” is introduced to capture the relationships between PC and an
       average low value of R(t) in Fig 6. This provides a slightly different view from Fig 5. The required
       reduction level becomes much lower, especially in Saitama, Chiba, Osaka, Hyogo, and Fukuoka,
       where generally low R(t)s are observed. On the other hand, Hokkaido, Tokyo, and Kanagawa still
       require a large reduction in number of visits to the hospitality sector. In these prefectures, a large
       number of infections were observed from an early stage, and the introduction of countermeasures (e.g.,
       the number of people wearing masks and social distancing at local spots within a 500m grid) might
       have been preventative.
         Fig 6. Necessary reduction level of visits to hospitality sectors to achieve R(t)<1 for “80% of
                                                                 days”
                  The above result is based on the case in which an 80% reliability level is arbitrarily
       determined, but more discussions may need to determine the reliability level that we can accept to
       determine the mobility reduction. A better discussion would be to determine the relationships
       between the mobility reduction levels at different reliability levels for R(t)<1 and estimate the
       economic impacts of different policies. However, this is beyond the scope of this study.
                  Another necessary discussion point lies in the difference between the first wave treated in
       this study and the second wave (after the end of June). Considering that the countermeasures have
       advanced, less restrictions on mobility may achieve R(t)<1. Continuous monitoring is necessary to
       understand when we will establish a new life with COVID-19.
       Conclusions
                  This study utilized mobility statistics and a business frame census on a fine spatial scale to
       capture the effective reproduction number of COVID-19, which is an important indicator in
       epidemiology. The measure of potential contacts in the hospitality sector/total business sector was
       defined, and the values of its parameters were estimated by maximizing the correlation between the
       measures and the effective reproduction number in eight Japanese prefectures, where the incidence is
       large. One of the major conclusions in this study is that the measure of potential contacts in the
       hospitality sector has a fair correlation with the effective reproduction number.
                  From this measure, the necessary population reduction level to converge the pandemic can
       be derived. Our analysis indicated 0.40-0.67 reductions are required to achieve R(t)<1 for all the days,
       depending on the conditions of the prefectures, but 0.14-0.61 are enough to achieve R(t)<1 for 80%
       of the days. Because of the regional variety in values, and high sensitivity to the required reliability to
       achieve R(t)<1, these relationships should be carefully checked in each prefecture to determine

       mobility restriction policies. An analysis of the relationships between mobility reduction and economic
       impacts would also assist in this kind of policy making.
                  For additional future studies on Japanese conditions, a comparative study between the first
       and second waves will be important to identify the progress of countermeasures. A similar analysis in
       other countries would also help to understand what level of mobility restrictions and local
       countermeasures would contribute to a low infection risk.
