21       Abstract

22       A growing number of studies provide insight into how SARS-CoV-2 spreads1-7. Yet, many

23       factors that characterize its transmissibility remain unclear, including mechanistic correlates of

24       overdispersion, viral kinetics, the extent to which respiratory droplets and aerosols carry viable

25       virus and the infectiousness of asymptomatic, presymptomatic and pediatric cases7. Here, we

26       developed a comprehensive dataset of respiratory viral loads (rVLs) via systematic review and

27       investigated these factors using meta-analyses and modeling. By comparing cases of COVID-19,

28       SARS and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, we found that heterogeneity in rVL was associated with

29       overdispersion and facilitated the distinctions in individual variation in infectiousness among

30       these emergent diseases. For COVID-19, case heterogeneity was broad throughout the infectious

31       period, although rVL tended to peak at 1 day from symptom onset (DFSO) and be elevated for 1-

32       5 DFSO. While most cases presented minimal risk, highly infectious ones could spread SARS-

33       CoV-2 by talking, singing or breathing, which shed virions at comparable rates via droplets and

34       aerosols. Coughing shed considerable quantities of virions, predominantly via droplets, and

35       greatly increased the contagiousness of many symptomatic cases relative to asymptomatic ones.

36       Asymptomatic and symptomatic infections showed similar likelihoods of expelling aerosols with

37       SARS-CoV-2, as did adult and pediatric cases. Children tended to be less contagious by droplet

38       spread than adults based on tendencies of symptomatology rather than rVL. Our findings address

39       longstanding questions on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and present pertinent considerations for

40       disease control.

41       Main body

42       The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally, causing the coronavirus disease 2019

43       (COVID-19) pandemic with more than 38.0 million infections and 1.0 million deaths (as of 13

44       October 2020)8. While the basic reproductive number has been estimated to be 2-3.61,2,

45       transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is highly overdispersed, with numerous instances of

46       superspreading9-11 and few cases (10-20%) causing many secondary infections (80%)4-6.

47       Estimates indicate 40-87% of cases are asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, which facilitates

48       transmission2,3,12. Infectiousness begins around -3 to -2 DFSO and has been estimated to last 8-

49       10 DFSO13-15. Hence, the temporal infectiousness profile of COVID-19 resembles that of

50       influenza16, whereas its overdispersion is similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome

51       (SARS)17.

52             For respiratory virus transmission, airway epithelial cells shed virions to the extracellular

53       fluid before atomization (from breathing, talking, singing, coughing and aerosol-generating

54       procedures) partitions them into a polydisperse mixture of droplets (>5 μm) and aerosols (≤5

55       μm) that are expelled to the ambient environment7. Based on mass, droplets tend to settle

56       gravitationally, whereas aerosols remain suspended and travel based on airflow profiles.

57       Although proximity has been associated with infection risk for COVID-1918, studies have also

58       suggested that long-range aerosol spread occurs conditionally9-11.

59             Despite these analyses, key factors that characterize the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2

60       remain unclear. To investigate many of these factors, we synthesized evidence by systematic

61       review, compared SARS-CoV-2 rVLs among subgroups, associated overdispersion, analyzed

62       viral kinetics and modeled the likelihood of shedding viable virus via droplets and aerosols

63       across respiratory activities, DFSO, case heterogeneity and subgroups. For inference on




                                                                           3

64       transmissibility, we compared these analyses with those of SARS-CoV-1 (the most closely

65       related human coronavirus) and A(H1N1)pdm09 (the most recent pandemic influenza virus),

66       which spread by contact, droplets and aerosols19,20.

67

68       Systematic review

69       To develop the comprehensive dataset, we conducted a systematic review on quantitative VL

70       measurements for respiratory specimens taken during the infectious periods of SARS-CoV-2 (-3

71       to 10 DFSO)13-15, SARS-CoV-1 (0-20 DFSO)21 and A(H1N1)pdm09 (-2 to 9 DFSO)16

72       (Methods). The systematic search (Supplementary Tables 1-5) identified 4,274 results. After

73       screening and full-text review, 63 studies met the inclusion criteria and were used for analysis

74       (Fig. 1) (n=9,692 total specimens), which included adult (n=5,124) and pediatric (n=1,593) cases

75       and measurements for asymptomatic (n=2,378), presymptomatic (n=28) and symptomatic

76       (n=7,231) infections. According to a hybrid Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist,

77       risk of bias was low to moderate for included studies (Extended Data Table 1).

78

79       Meta-analysis and subgroup analyses of rVL

80       For each study in the systematic dataset, we used specimen concentrations to estimate rVLs

81       (Methods). We then performed a random-effects meta-analysis (Extended Data Fig. 1), which

82       showed that, during the infectious periods, the expected rVL of SARS-CoV-2 was comparable to

83       that of SARS-CoV-1 (p=0.148, two-sided Welch’s t-test) but lesser than that of A(H1N1)pdm09

84       (p<0.0001). We also performed random-effects subgroup analyses for COVID-19 (Fig. 2), which

85       showed that expected SARS-CoV-2 rVLs were consistent between pediatric and adult cases

86       (p=0.861) and between symptomatic/presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections (p=0.951).




                                                                           4

 87

 88       Association of heterogeneity in rVL with overdispersion

 89       Since few cases drive the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (dispersion parameter k, 0.10-0.58)4-6

 90       and SARS-CoV-1 (k, 0.16-0.17)17 whereas A(H1N1)pdm09 (k, 7.4-14.4)22,23 spreads more

 91       homogeneously, we sought to find a mechanistic association for overdispersion. As an empirical

 92       estimate, k depends on myriad extrinsic (behavioral, environmental and invention) and host (host

 93       defenses) factors. However, since dispersion is similar across distinct outbreaks of a virus17, we

 94       hypothesized that an intrinsic virological factor mediates k for these emergent respiratory

 95       infections.

 96             We assessed heterogeneity in rVL. For all three viruses, rVLs best conformed to Weibull

 97       distributions (Extended Data Fig. 2), and we fitted the entirety of individual sample data for each

 98       virus in the systematic dataset (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 2n). While COVID-19 and SARS

 99       cases tended to shed lesser virus than those with A(H1N1)pdm09 (Extended Data Fig. 1), broad

100       heterogeneity in rVL inverted this relationship for highly infectious individuals (Extended Data

101       Fig. 3a-c). At the 90th case percentile (cp), the estimated rVL was 8.91 (8.82-9.00, 95%

102       confidence interval [CI]) log10 copies/ml for SARS-CoV-2, whereas it was 8.62 (8.47-8.76) log10

103       copies/ml for A(H1N1)pdm09. Moreover, heterogeneity in rVL was similar among adult,

104       pediatric, symptomatic/presymptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases (Extended Data Fig.

105       3d-g), with standard deviations (SDs) of 2.01-2.06 log10 copies/ml (Extended Data Table 2).

106             To investigate the relationship between k and heterogeneity in rVL, we performed a meta-

107       regression using each included study (Fig. 3b). The analysis showed a negative association

108       (p=0.031, meta-regression slope t-test), indicating that heterogeneity in rVL intrinsically

109       facilitated the distinctions in overdispersion among the emergent infections.

110

111       Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 rVL

112       To investigate dynamics, we delineated SARS-CoV-2 rVLs by DFSO and fitted the mean

113       estimates to a mechanistic epithelial cell-limited model for viral kinetics (Fig. 3c, Methods). The

114       outputs indicated that, on average, each productively infected cell in the airway epithelium shed

115       SARS-CoV-2 at 1.11 (0.51-1.71, 95% CI) copies/ml day-1 and infected up to 10.6 susceptible

116       cells (Extended Data Table 3). The turnover rate for infected epithelial cells was 0.55 (0.23-0.87)

117       days-1, while the half-life of SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract was 4.35 (2.23-97.8) hours. By

118       extrapolating the model to an initial rVL of 0-1 log10 copies/ml, the estimated incubation period

119       was 5.38-4.52 days, which agrees with epidemiological findings1. Conversely, the expected

120       duration of shedding was 26.8 DFSO. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 replicated exponentially in the

121       respiratory tract based on a mean rate constant of 4.02×10-7 (3.01×10-7-5.03×10-7) (copies/ml)-1

122       day-1 after infection. Around 1 DFSO, rVL peaked, as the number of infected epithelial cells

123       reached equilibrium, and then diminished exponentially.

124             As SARS-CoV-2 rVLs showed widespread heterogeneity across the infectious period, we

125       fitted distributions for each DFSO (Fig. 3d), which showed that high rVLs also increased from

126       the presymptomatic period before decreasing towards the end of the first week of illness. At the

127       90th cp, SARS-CoV-2 rVL peaked at 1 DFSO at 9.83 (9.12-10.61) log10 copies/ml, an order of

128       magnitude greater than the overall 90th-cp estimate (Extended Data Table 2). The estimate

129       remained ≥9.33 log10 copies/ml between 1-5 DFSO. At -1 DFSO, the 90th-cp rVL was 8.30

130       (6.88-10.02) log10 copies/ml, while it was 7.92 (7.34-8.55) log10 copies/ml at 10 DFSO

131       (Extended Data Fig. 3h-s).

133       Likelihood of droplets and aerosols containing virions

134       Since rVL is an intensive quantity, the volume fraction of virions is low and viral partitioning

135       coincides with atomization, we used Poisson statistics to model likelihood profiles. To calculate

136       an unbiased estimator of partitioning (the expected number of viable copies per particle), our

137       method multiplied rVL estimates with the volumes of atomized particles and an assumed

138       viability proportion of 0.1% after dehydration (Methods).

139             When expelled by the mean COVID-19 case across the infectious period, respiratory

140       particles showed minimal likelihoods of carrying viable SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4a,b). Aerosols

141       (dehydrated aerodynamic diameter [da]≤5 µm) were <0.001% likely to contain a virion. Droplets

142       also had low likelihoods: at da=40 µm, they were ≤0.4% likely to contain a virion.

143             COVID-19 cases with high rVLs, however, expelled particles with considerably greater

144       likelihoods of carrying viable copies (Fig. 4a,b). For the 98th cp at 1 DFSO, 18.2% (8.8-27.6%)

145       of aerosols (da=5 µm) contained at least one SARS-CoV-2 virion. For da>14.4 µm, droplets were

146       >99% likely to contain virions, with large ones carrying tens to hundreds.

147

148       Shedding SARS-CoV-2 via respiratory activities

149       Using the partitioning estimates in conjunction with published profiles of the particles expelled

150       by respiratory activities (Extended Data Fig. 4), we modeled the rates at which talking, singing,

151       breathing and coughing shed viable SARS-CoV-2 across da (Fig. 4c-f). Among the non-

152       presenting activities, singing emitted virions most rapidly followed by talking and then

153       breathing, although talking loudly was similar to singing (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). These

154       activities produced more aerosols than droplets, but particle size correlated with the likelihood of

155       containing virions. Thus, talking, singing and breathing shed SARS-CoV-2 at similar rates via




                                                                            7

156       aerosols and droplets: aerosols mediated 25.2-43.4% of the virions expelled by the non-

157       presenting activities (Fig. 4g). In comparison, coughing shed far greater quantities of virions

158       (Fig. 4f), of which >99.9% were carried by droplets.

159             We further examined the influences of case heterogeneity and disease course on expelling

160       SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4h, Extended Data Fig. 5). The estimated total shedding rates (over all

161       particle sizes) for a respiratory activity spanned ≥8.55 orders of magnitude on each DFSO;

162       cumulatively from -1 to 10 DFSO, they spanned 11.2 orders of magnitude. Hence, most cases

163       expelled a negligible number of SARS-CoV-2 virions by talking, singing or breathing. Shedding

164       occurred most rapidly at 1 DFSO: for the 98th cp, singing discharged 31.5 (3.26-379, 95% CI)

165       virions/min to the ambient environment, while talking emitted 4.67 (0.48-56.1) virions/min and

166       breathing exhaled 1.27 (0.13-15.2) virions/min; these estimates were two orders of magnitude

167       greater than those for the 86th cp. For the 98th cp at -1 DFSO, singing shed 1.31 (0.01-406)

168       virions/min and breathing exhaled 5.24×10-2 (5.28×10-4-16.3) virions/min. The estimates at 7-10

169       DFSO were comparable to these presymptomatic ones (Fig. 4h, Extended Data Fig. 5).

170             At 1 DFSO, coughing expelled 2.13×106 (2.20×105-2.56×107) virions/cough for the 98th cp,

171       90.4 (24.6-372) virions/cough for the 50th cp and 2.66 (0.65-13.1) virions/cough for the 25th cp

172       (Extended Data Fig. 5c). At -1 and 10 DFSO, these estimates were reduced by ~2 orders of

173       magnitude. Thus, most symptomatic cases shed considerable quantities of SARS-CoV-2 by

174       coughing; a single cough accounted for the virions emitted by weeks of singing for a case.

175             As indicated by similar mean rVLs (Fig. 2) and heterogeneities in rVL (Extended Data

176       Table 2), asymptomatic, symptomatic/presymptomatic, adult and pediatric COVID-19 cases

177       showed similar profiles for total shedding rates (Extended Fig. 6a-d). The estimates showed that

178       the top 6.1%, 2.4% and 1.1% of pediatric cases shed ≥1 virion/min by singing, talking and




                                                                            8

179       breathing, respectively, while 62.5% expelled ≥10 virions/cough. In general, highly infectious

180       COVID-19 cases expelled virions more rapidly than did ones with A(H1N1)pdm09 (Extended

181       Data Fig. 6f).

183       Discussion

184       This study provided comprehensive, systematic analyses of several factors characterizing the

185       transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. First, we evaluated the influence of heterogeneity in rVL. Our

186       findings show that broad heterogeneity in rVL facilitates greater variation in individual

187       infectiousness in the COVID-19 pandemic than was found in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. For each

188       respiratory activity, SARS-CoV-2 shedding rates span >11 orders of magnitude throughout the

189       infectious period. While most COVID-19 cases present minimal transmission risk by talking,

190       singing or breathing, highly infectious ones, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic

191       infections, can spread SARS-CoV-2 through these activities. Our model estimates, when

192       corrected to copies rather than virions, align with recent clinical findings for exhalation rates of

193       SARS-CoV-224. Moreover, the findings suggest that heterogeneity in rVL may be a virological

194       factor generally associated with overdispersion for respiratory infections. In this case, rVL

195       distribution may serve as an early correlate for transmission patterns, including superspreading,

196       during outbreaks of novel respiratory viruses, providing insight for disease control before large-

197       scale epidemiological analyses empirically characterize k.

198             Second, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 kinetics during respiratory infection. While

199       heterogeneity remains broad throughout the infectious period, the systematic dataset indicates

200       that rVL tends to peak at 1 DFSO and be elevated for 1-5 DFSO, coinciding with the period of

201       highest attack rates observed among close contacts25. These results indicate that transmission risk




                                                                            9

202       tends to be greatest soon after illness rather than in the presymptomatic period, which concurs

203       with large tracing studies (6.4-12.6% of secondary infections from presymptomatic

204       transmission)26,27 rather than early temporal models (~44%)14. Furthermore, our kinetic analysis

205       suggests that, on average, SARS-CoV-2 reaches diagnostic concentrations 1.60-3.22 days after

206       respiratory infection (-3.78 to -2.16 DFSO), assuming assay detection limits of 1-3 log10

207       copies/ml, respectively, for nasopharyngeal swabs immersed in 1 ml of transport media.

208             Third, we modeled the likelihood of shedding SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols. Talking, singing

209       and breathing shed SARS-CoV-2 at comparable rates through droplets and aerosols (up to tens to

210       hundreds of virions/min). As airborne spread is recognized as a key mode of transmission for

211       A(H1N1)pdm0920, our model estimates and comparative analyses support, particularly for highly

212       infectious cases, airborne spread as a transmission mode for SARS-CoV-2. While our models

213       delineated aerosols from droplets at the classical threshold (da=5 µm), recent reports show that,

214       based on emission vectors and environmental conditions, respiratory particles larger than 5 µm

215       can also travel >2 m in air28,29, further supporting the plausibility of the airborne transmission of

216       SARS-CoV-2. However, with short durations of stay in well-ventilated areas, the concentration,

217       and exposure risk, of aerosols remains correlated with proximity to infectious cases18,28.

218             Fourth, we assessed the relative infectiousness of COVID-19 subgroups. Since rVL

219       distributions are similar among subgroups and the predominant source of aerosols is the non-

220       presenting respiratory activities (talking, singing and breathing), symptomatic and asymptomatic

221       infections present similar risks for aerosol spread, as do adult and pediatric cases. However, most

222       cases shed considerable numbers of virions via large droplets by coughing, a common symptom

223       of COVID-1930. Thus, symptomatic infections tend to be significantly more contagious than

224       asymptomatic ones, providing a reason as to why asymptomatic cases transmit SARS-CoV-2 at




                                                                           10

225       lower relative rates3, especially in close contact31, despite similar rVLs and increased contact

226       patterns. Accordingly, children (48-54% of symptomatic cases present with cough)32,33 tend to be

227       less contagious by droplet spread than adults (68-80%)30,33 based on tendencies of

228       symptomatology rather than rVL.

229             Our study has limitations. The systematic search found a limited number of studies reporting

230       quantitative specimen measurements from the presymptomatic period, meaning these estimates

231       may be sensitive to sampling bias. Although additional studies have reported semiquantitative

232       metrics (cycle thresholds), these data were excluded because they cannot be compared on an

233       absolute scale due to batch effects34, limiting use in compound analyses. Furthermore, our

234       analyses considered population-level estimates of the infectious periods and viability

235       proportions, which omit individual variation in the dynamics of virus viability. Some patients

236       shed SARS-CoV-2 with diminishing viability soon after symptom onset13, while others produce

237       replication-competent virus for weeks35. It remains unelucidated how case characteristics and

238       environmental factors affect the viability dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.

239             Taken together, our findings provide a potential path forward for disease control. They

240       highlight the disproportionate role of high-risk cases, settings and circumstances in propelling

241       the COVID-19 pandemic. Since highly infectious cases, regardless of age or symptomatology,

242       can rapidly shed SARS-CoV-2 via both droplets and aerosols, airborne spread should also be

243       recognized as a transmission risk, including for superspreading. Strategies to abate infection

244       should limit crowd numbers and duration of stay while reinforcing distancing and then

245       widespread mask usage; well-ventilated settings can be recognized as lower risk venues.

246       Coughing sheds considerable quantities of virions for most infections, while rVL tends to peak at

247       1 DFSO and can be high throughout the infectious period. Thus, immediate, sustained self-




                                                                           11

248       isolation upon symptom presentation is crucial to curb transmission from symptomatic cases.

249       While diagnosing COVID-19, qRT-PCR can also help to triage contact tracing, prioritizing

250       patients with higher specimen measurements: for nasopharyngeal swabs immersed in 1 ml of

251       transport media, ≥7.14 (7.07-7.22, 95% CI) log10 copies/ml corresponds to ≥80th cp. Doing so

252       may identify asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases more efficiently, a key step towards

253       mitigation as the pandemic continues.

388       Methods

389       Search strategy, selection criteria and data collection

390       We undertook a systematic review and prospectively submitted the systematic review protocol

391       for registration on PROSPERO (registration number, CRD42020204637). Other than the title of

392       this study, we have followed PRISMA reporting guidelines36. The systematic review was

393       conducted according to Cochrane methods guidance37.

394             The search included papers that (i) reported positive, quantitative measurements (copies/ml

395       or an equivalent metric) of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 or A(H1N1)pdm09 in human

396       respiratory specimens (ETA, NPA, NPS, OPS, POS and Spu) from COVID-19, SARS or

397       A(H1N1)pdm09 cases; (ii) reported data that could be extracted from the infectious periods of

398       SARS-CoV-2 (defined as -3 to +10 DFSO for symptomatic cases and 0 to +10 days from the day

399       of laboratory diagnosis for asymptomatic cases), SARS-CoV-1 (defined as 0 to +20 DFSO or the

400       equivalent asymptomatic period) or A(H1N1)pdm09 (defined as -2 to +9 DFSO for symptomatic

401       cases and 0 days to +9 days from the day of laboratory diagnosis for asymptomatic cases); and

402       (iii) reported data for two or more cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, SARS or

403       A(H1N1)pdm09. Quantitative specimen measurements were considered after RNA extraction for

404       diagnostic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 (Ofr1b, N, RdRp and E genes), SARS-CoV-1 (Ofr1b, N

405       and RdRp genes) and A(H1N1)pdm09 (HA and M genes).

406             Studies were excluded, in the following order, if they (i) studied an ineligible disease; (ii)

407       had an ineligible study design, including those that were reviews of evidence (e.g., scoping,

408       systematic, narrative), did not include primary clinical human data, reported data for less than

409       two cases due to an increased risk of selection bias, were incomplete (e.g., ongoing clinical

410       trials), did not report an RNA extraction step before measurement or were studies measuring




                                                                           23

411       environmental samples; (iii) reported an ineligible metric for specimen concentration (e.g.,

412       qualitative RT-PCR or cycle threshold [Ct] values without calibration included in the study); (iv)

413       reported quantitative measurements from an ineligible specimen type (e.g., blood specimens,

414       pooled specimens or self-collected POS or Spu patient specimens in the absence of a healthcare

415       professional); (v) reported an ineligible sampling period (consisted entirely of data that could not

416       be extracted from within the infectious period); or (vi) were duplicates of an included study (e.g.,

417       preprinted version of published paper or duplicates not identified by Covidence). We included

418       data from control groups receiving standard of care in interventional studies but excluded data

419       from the intervention group. Patients in the intervention group are, by definition, systematically

420       different from general case populations because they receive therapies not being widely used for

421       treatment, which may influence virus concentrations. Interventional studies examining the

422       comparative effectiveness of two or more treatments were excluded for the same reason. Studies

423       exclusively reporting semiquantitative measurements (e.g., Ct values) of specimen concentration

424       were excluded, as these measurements are sensitive to batch inconsistencies and, without proper

425       calibration, cannot be compared on an absolute scale across studies34.

426             We searched, without the use of filters or language restrictions, the following sources:

427       MEDLINE (via Ovid, 1946 to 7 August 2020), EMBASE (via Ovid, 1974 to 7 August 2020,

434       (both searched through Google Scholar via the Publish or Perish program, to 7 August 2020).

435       We also gathered studies by searching through the reference lists of review articles identified by

436       the database search, by searching through the reference lists of included articles, through expert

437       recommendation (by Epic J. Topol, Akiko Iwasaki and A. Marm Kilpatrick on Twitter) and by

438       hand-searching through journals (Nature, Nat. Med., Science, NEJM, Lancet, Lancet Infect. Dis.,

439       JAMA, JAMA Intern. Med. and BMJ). A comprehensive search was developed by a librarian,

440       which included subject headings and keywords. The search strategy had 3 main concepts

441       (disease, specimen type and outcome), and each concept was combined using the appropriate

442       Boolean operators. The search was tested against a sample set of known articles that were pre-

443       identified. The line-by-line search strategies for all databases are included in Supplementary

444       Tables 1-5. The search results were exported from each database and uploaded to the Covidence

445       online system for deduplication and screening.

446             Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, reviewed full texts, collected data

447       and assessed risk of bias via Covidence and a hybrid critical appraisal checklist based on the

448       Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tools for case series, analytical cross-sectional studies and

449       prevalence studies38-40. To evaluate the sample size in a study, we used the following calculation:

                                                                             #"$
450                                                                  !∗ =        ,                                                        (1)
                                                                             %"

451       where !∗ is the sample size threshold, # is the z-score for the level of confidence (95%), $ is the

452       standard deviation (assumed to be 3 log10 copies/ml, one quarter of the full range of rVLs) and %

453       is the marginal error (assumed to be 1 log10 copies/ml, based on the minimum detection limit for

454       qRT-PCR across studies)41. The hybrid JBI critical appraisal checklist is shown in the

455       Supplementary Notes. Inconsistencies were resolved by discussion and consensus.

456             The search found 27 studies for COVID-1913,35,42-66, 9 studies for SARS67-75 and 27 studies

457       for A(H1N1)pdm0976-102. Quantitative specimen measurements were collected directly if

458       reported numerically or using WebPlotDigitizer 4.3 (https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/) if reported

459       graphically. For included studies, we also collected the relevant numbers of cases, types of cases,

460       volumes of transport media, pharmacotherapies, DFSO (for symptomatic cases) or day relative to

461       initial laboratory diagnosis (for asymptomatic cases) on which each specimen was taken and

462       numbers of tested specimens. Hospitalized cases were defined as those being tested in a hospital

463       setting and then admitted. Non-admitted cases were defined as those being testing in a hospital

464       setting but not admitted. Community cases were defined as those being tested in a community

465       setting. Symptomatic, presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections were defined as in the study.

466       Based on rare description in the included studies, paucisymptomatic infections, when defined in

467       a study, were included with symptomatic ones. Pediatric cases were defined as those of 18 years

468       of age or lower or as defined in the study. Adult cases were defined as those above 18 years of

469       age or as defined in the study.

471       Meta-analysis of rVLs

472             Based on the search design and composition of included studies, the meta-analysis overall

473       estimates were the expected SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and A(H1N1)pdm09 rVL when

474       encountering a COVID-19, SARS or A(H1N1)pdm09 case, respectively, during their infectious

475       period. To determine rVLs, data collected on positive, quantitative specimen measurements were

476       converted to the RNA concentration in the respiratory tract. Viral concentrations in respiratory

477       specimens were denoted as specimen measurements, whereas viral concentrations in the

478       respiratory tract were denoted as rVLs. For example, measurements from swabbed specimens

479       (NPS and OPS) typically report the RNA concentration in viral transport media. Based on the

480       expected uptake volume for swabs (0.128 ± 0.031 ml, mean ± SD)103 or reported collection

481       volume for expulsed fluid in each study (e.g., 0.5 to 1 ml) along with the reported volume of

482       transport media in each study (e.g., 1 ml), we calculated the dilution factor for each respiratory

483       specimen to estimate the rVLs. If the diluent volume was not reported, then the dilution factor

484       was calculated assuming a volume of 1 ml (NPS and OPS), 2 ml (POS and ETA) or 3 ml (NPA)

485       of transport media43,45,71. Unless dilution was reported for Spu specimens, we used the specimen

486       measurement as the rVL13. The non-reporting of diluent volume was noted as an element

487       increasing risk of bias in the hybrid JBI critical appraisal checklist. Viral load estimates (based

488       on instrumentation, calibration, procedures and reagents) are not standardized. While the above

489       procedures (including only quantitative measurements after extraction, collecting assay detection

490       limits, correcting for specimen dilution) have considered many of these factors, non-

491       standardization is an inherent limitation in interpreting specimen measurements across studies.

492             Pooled estimates and 95% CIs for the expected rVL of each virus across their infectious

493       period were calculated using a random-effects meta-analysis. The estimates for rVL assumed

494       that each viral copy was extracted and quantified from the tested specimen aliquot. For studies

495       reporting summary statistics in medians and interquartile or total ranges, we derived estimates of

496       the mean and variance and calculated the 95% CIs104. All calculations were performed in units of

497       log10 copies/ml. Between-study heterogeneity in meta-analysis was assessed using the I2 and τ2

498       statistics. The weighting for each study in its virus group was calculated as the reciprocal of the

499       rVL variance.

502       Subgroup analyses were conducted to compare the expected rVLs of SARS-CoV-2 in adult,

503       pediatric, symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, as previously defined, during the

504       infectious period. The overall estimate for each subgroup was the expected rVL when

505       encountering a case of that subgroup during the infectious period. Studies reporting data

506       exclusively from a subgroup of interest were included in the analysis without modification. For

507       studies in which data for these subgroups constituted only part of its dataset, rVLs from the

508       subgroup were collected to calculate the mean, variance and 95% CIs. All calculations were

509       performed in units of log10 copies/ml. In the analysis, we excluded studies with only a single case

510       in our subgroups of interest. Pooled estimates and 95% CIs for each subgroup were calculated

511       using a random-effects meta-analysis, in which between-study heterogeneity was assessed using

512       the I2 and τ2 statistics. The weighting for each study in its subgroup was calculated as the

513       reciprocal of the rVL variance.

514

515       Distribution of rVL

516       To analyze heterogeneity in rVLs, we pooled the entirety of individual sample data (reported as

517       individual specimen measurements rather through descriptive statistics) in the systematic dataset

518       by disease, COVID-19 subgroups and DFSO. For analyses of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics across

519       DFSO, we included estimated rVLs from negative qRT-PCR measurements of respiratory

520       specimens (n=3, 3, 6, 8, 12, 15, 13, 17 and 14 negative specimens for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10

521       DFSO, respectively) for cases that had previously been quantitatively confirmed to have

522       COVID-19. These rVLs were estimated based on the reported assay detection limit in the

523       respective study. Probability plots and modified Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were used to

524       determine the suitability of normal, lognormal, gamma and Weibull distributions to describe the

526       data best conformed to Weibull distributions, which is described by the probability density

529       where , is the shape factor, - is the scale factor and + is rVL (+ ≥ 0 log10 copies/ml). In this

530       distribution, the value of the rVL at the 4 th percentile was determined using the quantile function,

531                                                        ++ = -[− ln(1 − 4)]%/# .                                                       (3)

532       For cp curves, we used eq. (3) to determine rVLs from the 1st cp to the 99th cp (step size, 1%).

533       Curve fitting to eq. (2) and calculation of eq. (3) and its 95% CI was performed using the

534       Distribution Fitter application in Matlab R2019b (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts,

535       USA).

536

537       Meta-regression of k and heterogeneity in rVL

538       To assess the relationship between k and heterogeneity in rVL, we performed a univariate meta-

539       regression (log > = ?(@A) + C, where ? is the slope for association and C is the intercept)

540       between pooled estimates of k (based on studies describing community transmission) for

541       COVID-19 (k=0.409)4-6,105-108, SARS (k=0.165)17 and A(H1N1)pdm09 (k=8.155)22,23 and the SD

542       of the rVLs in each study. Since the negative binomial distribution, from which k is derived17, is

543       analogous to a compound Poisson distribution in which each random variable is Log(>)-

544       distributed, the meta-regression was performed with log >. Based on negligible between-study

545       heterogeneity, we used a fixed-effects model. This analysis assumes that the SD of rVLs in each

546       study estimates SD of rVL for the disease. Thus, for weighting in the meta-regression, we used

547       the proportion of rVL samples for each study relative to the entire systematic dataset (E, =

549       presented along with the p-value for association (meta-regression slope t-test for ?) between the

550       two variables. The meta-regression assumed that the viability proportion (for viruses exiting the

551       respiratory tract) was similar across cases for a given respiratory infection; it could be a different

552       value for different diseases. The meta-regression also assumed that the rate profile of particles

553       expelled by respiratory activities (e.g., talking) is similar among the diseases. The limit of

554       detection for qRT-PCR instruments used in the included studies did not significantly affect the

555       analysis of heterogeneity in rVL, as these limits tended to be below the values found for

556       specimens with low virus concentrations.

557

558       Viral kinetics

559       To model the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 rVL, we used a mechanistic epithelial cell-limited model

560       for the respiratory tract109, based on the system of differential equations:

                                                                    %G

564       where G is the number of uninfected target cells, K is the number of productively infected cells, I

565       is the rVL, - is the infection rate constant, N is the rate at which airway epithelial cells shed virus

566       to the extracellular fluid, O is the clearance rate of the virus and L is the clearance rate of

567       productively infected cells. Parameter units are summarized in Extended Data Table 3. Using

578       where T = N-/O, for a form with greater numerical stability. The system of differential equations

579       was fitted on the mean estimates of SARS-CoV-2 rVL between -2 and 10 DFSO using the

580       entirety of individual sample data in units of copies/ml. Numerical analysis was implemented

581       using the Fit ODE app in OriginPro 2019b (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton,

582       Massachusetts, USA) via the Runge-Kutta method and initial parameters I1 , K1 and G1 of 4

583       copies/ml, 0 cells and 5×107 cells, respectively, for the range -5 to 10 DFSO. The analysis was

584       first performed with eqs. (8)-(9). These output parameters were then used to initialize final

585       analysis using eqs. (4)-(6), where the estimates for - and L were input as fixed and variable

586       parameters, respectively. The fitted line and its coefficient of determination (r2) were presented.

587             To estimate the average incubation period, we extrapolated the kinetic model to 0 and 1

588       log10 copies/ml pre-symptom onset. To estimate the average duration of shedding, we

589       extrapolated the model to 0 log10 copies/ml post-symptom onset. Unlike experimental estimates,

590       this estimate for duration of shedding was not defined by assay detection limits. These analyses

591       had limitations. To estimate the average DFSO on which SARS-CoV-2 concentration reached

593       log10 copies/ml in specimen concentration (chosen as example assay detection limits), as

594       described by the dilution factor estimation above. The average time from respiratory infection to

595       reach diagnostic levels was then calculated by subtracting these values from the incubation

596       period for 0 log10 copies/ml. However, the extrapolated time for SARS-CoV-2 to reach

597       diagnostic concentrations in the respiratory tract should be validated in tracing studies, in which

598       contacts are prospectively subjected to daily sampling.

600       Considerations for particle dehydration

601       The desiccation time of a particle in air was described H456 = C $% (%7" − %456
                                                                                      "
                                                                                          ), where C is

602       prefactor for dehydration rate which depends on the environmental conditions, %7 is the initial

603       hydrated diameter and %456 is particle diameter after desiccation111. After desiccation, the

604       remaining non-volatile matter (ions, molecules, viruses and cells) governs particle size, which is

605       approximately 0.44 times the initial size of particles atomized in the respiratory tract112.

606       Dehydrated aerodynamic diameter was calculated by %9 = %: (V/V1 )%/" , where %: is the

607       dehydrated particle size, V is the material density of the respiratory particle and V1 is the

608       reference material density (1 g/cm3). For conservative estimates, the value of b was taken to be

609       64.9 µm2/s113 based on conditions of room temperature and a relative humidity of 59% (near the

610       upper limit of 60% for healthcare and typical indoor specifications)114. The equation for

611       desiccation time indicated that respiratory particles begin to dehydrate immediately upon release

612       to the ambient environment. Desiccation occurred rapidly, as the equation estimated that an 11.4-

613       µm particle desiccated to 5 µm in 1.6 s within the model conditions, and this value was an upper

614       limit for the desiccation times of aerosols (H456 ≤ 1.6 s).

616       Likelihood of respiratory particles containing virions

617       To calculate an unbiased estimator for viral partitioning (the expected number of viable copies in

618       an expelled particle at a given size), we multiplied rVLs with the volume equation for spherical

619       particles during atomization and the estimated viability proportion:
                                                                       YVZ: [+ ;

                                                                         6

621       where X is the expectation value, V is the material density of the respiratory particle (997 g/m3),

622       Z: is the volumetric conversion factor (1 ml/g), [ is the viability proportion, + is the rVL and % is

623       the hydrated diameter of the particle during atomization. The model assumed [ was 0.1% for the

624       viruses. For influenza, approximately 0.1% of copies in particles expelled from the respiratory

625       tract represent viable virus115, which is equivalent to one in 3 log10 copies/ml for rVL or, after

626       dilution in transport media, roughly one in 4 log10 copies/ml for specimen concentration. Recent

627       reports have detected culture-positive respiratory specimens with SARS-CoV-2 concentrations

628       down to 4 log10 copies/ml13, including from pediatric patients62 and in the presymptomatic

629       period15, suggesting the assumption was also suitable for SARS-CoV-2.

640             Based on the relative relationship between the residence time of expelled particles before

641       assessment (~5 s)116 in the referenced study115 and the estimated dehydration rates of expelled

642       particles, we took the viability proportion (0.1%) to be for dehydrated particles. The model

643       calculated partitioning of copies using the hydrated volume and then applied the viability

644       proportion for number of virions in particles after emission and dehydration. Thus, we compared

645       likelihoods among expelled, dehydrated particles. In Fig. 4, the comparison between hydrated

646       and dehydrated diameters showed only the relationship in particle size and not the relationship in

647       likelihood of containing viable virus. Based on the scope of the study, the model did not account

648       for the virion half-life as particles deposit onto surfaces or remain suspended in air117.

649

650       Rate profiles of particles expelled by respiratory activities

651       For the rate profiles of particles expelled during respiratory activities, we used distributions from

652       the literature. For coughing, we considered the rate (particles/cough) of expelling particles at

653       different sizes, as determined by Loudon and Roberts118, by calculating the mean number of

654       respiratory particles expelled per cough based on subject tests RI, RII, LI, LII and EI (EII was

655       presumed to be an outlier based on the relative rate when compared to EI). These particles were

656       taken to be dehydrated based on the deposition time in the experiment relative to estimated

657       dehydration rates. We compared this rate profile to that of Duguid119, which were taken to be

658       hydrated particles based on experimental design. For talking, singing and breathing, we obtained

659       data from Morawaska et al120. Rate profiles (particles/min) were calculated by converting the


                                                                           34

660       normalized concentration (particles/cm3) at each particle size based on normalization (32

661       channels per decade) for the aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) used, unit conversion (cm3 to L)

662       and the sample flow rate (1 L/min). Rate profiles of talking and singing were isolated from

663       breathing by subtracting the contribution of breathing to the combined data. Particles were taken

664       to be dehydrated based on the minimum particle age in the measurements. Based on the APS

665       used, the analyzed range for da was 0.3-20 μm. While larger droplets may potentially be expelled

666       by the respiratory activities, the data suggested that their emission rates were minimal, and there

667       was a limited bias associated with instrumentation. We compared these data for talking with rate

668       profiles of talking loudly and talking quietly from Asadi et al121. For data reported in a size

669       channel, we took the particle size to be the median value. Curves based on discrete particle

670       measurements were connected using the nonparametric Akima spline function.

671

672       Shedding virions via respiratory droplets and aerosols

673       To determine the respiratory shedding rate across particle size, rVL estimates and the hydrated

674       diameters of particles expelled by a respiratory activity were input into eq. (10), and the output

675       was then multiplied by the rate profile of the activity (talking, singing, breathing or coughing).

676       Dehydration and viability considerations were continued from the likelihood models. The model

677       used particle profiles from (coughing) Loudon and Roberts118 or (talking, singing and breathing)

678       Morawaska et al120.

679             To determine the total respiratory shedding rate for a given respiratory activity across cp, we

680       determined the cumulative hydrated volumetric rate (by summing the hydrated volumetric rates

681       across particle sizes for that respiratory activity) and input it into eq. (10). Using rVLs as




                                                                           35

682       determined by the Weibull quantile functions, we then calculated the Poisson means and their

683       95% CIs at different cps.

684             To assess the relative contribution of aerosols and droplets to mediating respiratory viral

685       shedding for a given respiratory activity, we calculated the proportion of the cumulative hydrated

686       volumetric rate contributed by aerosols (da≤5 μm) or droplets (da>5 μm) for that respiratory

687       activity. Since the Poisson mean was proportional to cumulative volumetric rate, this estimate of

688       the relative contribution of aerosols and droplets to respiratory viral shedding was consistent

689       among viruses and cps in the model.

690             In this study, the model for shedding virions via droplets and aerosols did not delineate

691       particles generated in the upper respiratory tract from those generated in the lower respiratory

692       tract, as the sites of atomization remain poorly understood. It also did not differentiate cases with

693       significant expectoration from those without it. In addition, it did not account for individual

694       variation in the profiles of expelled particles; superemitters can expel respiratory particles at

695       rates ~3 times above median121.

696

697       Statistical analysis

698       For data collection, statistical analysis, coding and data visualization, we used Excel v16.40

699       (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA), OriginPro 2019b (OriginLab

700       Corporation, Northampton, Massachusetts, USA) and Matlab R2019b (MathWorks, Inc., Natick,

701       Massachusetts, USA). Between-study heterogeneity in the random-effects meta-analyses was

702       assessed using the I2 and τ2 statistics. Probability plots for normal, lognormal, gamma and

703       Weibull distributions of rVLs were scored based on the Blom method. Modified Kolmogorov-

704       Smirnov tests were used to determine the goodness of fits between rVLs (in log10 copies/ml) and




                                                                           36

705       normal, lognormal, gamma or Weibull distributions. By accepting the null hypothesis in the

706       modified Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, the given distribution cannot be rejected to fit the data.

707       Based on fitted Weibull distribution parameters, the Weibull quantile function was used to

708       determine the rVL and its 95% CIs at a given cp. The association between k and rVL was

709       assessed via meta-regression, and the p-value for association was based on the meta-regression

710       slope t-test. Likelihood profiles were determined using the Poisson probability mass function and

711       the unbiased estimator for the expected partitioning of virions at a given particle size. Variance

712       on likelihood estimates was determined via the delta method. Since case variance or sample size

713       may be unequal among the viral infections or subgroups, the two-sided Welch’s t-test was used

714       to compare the difference of expected rVLs in the meta-analysis and subgroup analyses. For all

715       statistical analyses, the significance level (α) was taken to be 0.05.

977       comparing the expected rVLs for COVID-19, SARS and A(H1N1)pdm09 cases during the

978       infectious period. Quantitative specimen measurements were used to estimate rVLs, which refer

979       to virus concentrations in the respiratory tract. Case types: hospitalized (H), not admitted (N),

980       community (C), adult (A), pediatric (P), symptomatic (S), presymptomatic (Ps) and

981       asymptomatic (As). Specimen types: endotracheal aspirate (ETA), nasopharyngeal aspirate

982       (NPA), nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), posterior oropharyngeal saliva

983       (POS) and sputum (Spu). Studies after ref. 35 are listed in Methods. Dashes denote case numbers

1041          †Responses of “no” for pharmacotherapy are based on no pharmacotherapy given to any patients or none reported in the study.

1042          ‡For studies reporting specimen measurements as individual sample data (either in numerical or graphical formats), the sample data was extracted for analysis.

1043          §Specimen measurements were converted to rVLs based on the dilution factor for specimens immersed in transport media.

                For Chu et al., only specimen measurements at 20 DFSO were extracted, as 5-15 DFSO were equivalent specimens as those reported in Peiris et al.

1049   *These two columns summarize the cumulative number of specimens (left) collected from the number of studies (right) for each category in the systematic dataset.
1050   †The mean and sample SD were calculated on the entire set of individual sample data for each category.

1051   ‡The Weibull quantile distributions were used to determine rVLs at the 90th, 95th and 99th cps.

1052   §These categories included only rVL data from positive (above the detection limit) qRT-PCR measurements.

1053   ||Data for earlier DFSO were excluded from distribution fitting based on limited data, and empty cells were marked with “-“.

1054   ¶These categories included negative qRT-PCR measurements (set at the detection limit to estimate rVLs; n = 3, 3, 6, 8, 12, 15, 13, 17 and 14 specimens for 2-10 DFSO, respectively) for cases that tested

1055   positive at an earlier DFSO.
