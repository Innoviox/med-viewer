       Abstract
       Introduction: Hemolytic diseases such as Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) are
       characterized by a natural propensity for both arterial and venous thrombosis.
       Evidence showing that heme can induce tissue factor (TF) expression in
       endothelial cells and TF-dependent coagulation activation in animal models of
       SCD suggest that heme can contribute to hypercoagulability in this condition.
       We recently demonstrated that heme can induce coagulation activation in whole
       blood of healthy volunteers in a TF-dependent fashion. Methods: Herein, we
       aimed to evaluate whether this heme-induced coagulation activity was
       dependent on the expression and/or activation of hematopoietic TF in human
       mononuclear cells. TF mRNA expression was evaluated by qPCR and TF
       procoagulant activity was evaluated using a 2-stage assay based on the
       generation of FXa. Results: Heme was capable of inducing TF expression and
       activation in a TLR4-dependent pathway. This activity was further amplified
       after TNF-α-priming. Conclusion: Our results provide additional evidences on
       the mechanisms by which heme is involved in the pathogenesis of
       hypercoagulability in hemolytic diseases.
       Keywords: Sickle Cell Anemia, heme, tissue factor, hypercoagulability.

       Introduction
       Clinical and experimental data clearly demonstrate that hemolytic anemias such
       as Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), β thalassemia, paroxysmal nocturnal
       hemoglobinuria and autoimmune hemolytic anemia are associated with
                                       1–3
       hypercoagulability                 . Heme is an essential molecule present in almost all
       forms of life. However, evidence gathered in the last two decades show that
       free heme, which can be released from hemoglobin during intravascular
       hemolysis, can be toxic to cells by both direct (via Fenton reaction and reactive
       oxygen         species           generation)         and      indirect     (innate         immunity-mediated)
                             4
       mechanisms              . The effects of heme on several compartments of innate
       immunity have been described over the last two decades, leading to the
       concept that free heme can behave as an erythrocyte danger associated
                                                                                                              5,6
       molecular pattern (DAMP), through the activation of TLR4 receptors                                         . Since
                                                                                                    7,8
       hemostasis is currently regarded as part of innate immunity                                     , heme has also
       been studied as a potential mediator of hypercoagulability.
       In this regard, heme has been shown to induce the expression of tissue factor
       (TF) in cultured endothelial cells 9, and was subsequently characterized as a
       mediator of coagulation activation in vivo in mice models of SCD, in a study that
       also demonstrated that heme was capable to activate TF in human monocytes
       10
         . Moreover, heme has also been shown to induce the formation of neutrophil
       extracellular            traps,         which        facilitate     coagulation             activation      during
                                           11
       thromboinflammation                   . Recently, we demonstrated that incubation of heme in
       whole blood from healthy volunteers triggers coagulation activation in a TF-
                                        12
       dependent fashion                   . Together, these results support the concept that free
       heme could be involved in the initiation and/or maintenance of hypercoagulabity
       in SCD and other hemolytic conditions.
       Yet, the mechanisms by which heme activates hemostasis are not entirely
       clear, and limited evidence is available supporting its effect on TF mRNA
       expression and activation. Here we characterized in more detail the effect of
       heme on TF expression and activation in human peripheral blood mononuclear
       cells (PBMCs), and explored the effects of TNF- and TLR-4 in this process.

       Methods
       Obtention of PBMC from blood donors
       This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and
       approved by the Ethics Committee of University of Campinas (CAAE:
       46853115.4.0000.5404). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were
                                                                                  13,14
       obtained from buffy coats as previously described                                , using de-identified blood
       bags provided after whole blood fractionation from the blood center of University
       of Campinas (Hemocentro). Bags containing residual buffy coats were
       conserved at 4° C overnight and quickly pre-processed the next day. Peripheral
       blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated with 1.077 density of ficoll
       (Ficoll-paque Plus, GE Healthcare) after dilution of the obtained buffy coat with
       PBS 1X (1:3 dilution vol:vol). After separation of PBMCs, cells were seeded in
       culture plates at a quantity equivalent to 5*106 and 2*106 monocytes (based on
       automated cell counts in a hematology analyzer) for quantitative PCR (qPCR)
       and functional coagulation assays, respectively. Cells were then incubated at
       37°C for 4h with heme or vehicle at different concentrations. When necessary,
       cells were primed with 2ng/mL of TNF-α at 37°C for 1h or pre-treated with
       5ng/ml of TLR4 specific inhibitor Tak-242. After incubation, supernatants were
       removed to harvest only adherent cells in order to enrich the monocyte content
                               15–18
       of the sample                   . Cells were washed with PBS and re-suspended in HBSA
       buffer to measure TF pro-coagulant activity (TF PCA) with a two-stage assay
       based on FXa generation, or were lysed with Trizol for TF mRNA expression by
       qPCR. Pre-processed samples were stored at -80°C until total RNA extraction
       or TF PCA analysis.
       Whole blood collection and plasma separation
       Whole blood samples were collected from healthy volunteers by venipuncture in
       vacuum tubes containing 3.2% sodium citrate (BD Vacutainer Coagulation
       Tube, 2.7 ml, 0.109 M buffered sodium citrate). These samples were also
       treated with heme or vehicle. Samples were then incubated at 37°C for 4h.
       Plasma samples were immediately processed to perform one-stage coagulation
       assay.

       Heme (Ref H651-9; Frontier Scientific, USA) was diluted with 100μl of NaOH
       0.1M then adjusted with 900 μl of ultra-filtered water to initial working
       concentration of 5 mM. This solution was filtrated though a 0.22μm filter and
       freshly used according the scenario.
       Gene expression quantification by qPCR
       Total RNA was extracted using Trizol using classical methods. For each
       sample, 1μg of RNA was transcribed using High-capacity cDNA Reverse
       Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems™). TF gene expression was evaluated by
       qPCR and normalized using the geometric mean of two reference transcripts
       EEF2 (ENST00000309311) and MYH9 (ENST00000216181) provided by HT
                                19
       Atlas database               . These transcripts were shown to be among the most stably
       expressed in PBMCs and have been validated in our experiment.
       Two-stage TF PCA assay
       TF PCA of adherent fractions of PBMCs were evaluated by a two-stage
       chromogenic assay based on the kinetics of FXa generation, as previously
       described. Briefly, 30µl of treated cells suspended in HBSA was incubated with
       20µl of HBSA containing 150nM FX, 1nM FVIIa and 3mM CaCl2 for 2 hours at
              20
       37°C      . In these experiments, an IgG control antibody and an anti-TF antibody
       treatment (15 min of incubation at room temperature with 400µg/ml final
       concentration) were used to measure the fraction of Xa generation that is
       dependent on TF. After incubation, FXa generation was stopped by 25 μL of
       EDTA buffer (25 mM) for 10 min, and then 25 μL of 0.3mM FXa substrate
       Pefachrome sFXa (Pefachrome®) was added for absorbance reading at 405
       nm every 30 seconds, for 30 minutes. Absorbance was referred to an Innovin
       (2.5nM-0.02nM) standard curve. Final results were expressed as the equivalent
       of TF (in pg/mL) to the procoagulant activity from IgG treated samples
       subtracted from procoagulant activity in anti-TF treated samples.
       One-stage clotting test
       Heme-induced procoagulant activity of plasma was measured using a one-
       stage clotting test performed using a semi-automated coagulometer (Max Start
       4, Diagnostica Stago) after pre-incubation of heme at 37°C with normal human
                                                                                                               21
       plasma,        followed           by    re-calcification         as   previously          described        .    The

       procoagulant activity was determined using standard curve generated with a
       recombinant human relipidated TF (Innovin, Dade Behring). Results were
       reported in units of TF activity. In 50 µl of test sample, one unit of TF activity
       was arbitrarily defined as the amount of TF which yields a 50 seconds clotting
       time with pooled normal plasma 22.
       Statistical analysis
       Experiments were repeated at least 3 times, and results were expressed as the
       median         of     each         variable.       Statistical      analysis      was        performed       using
       GraphPadPrism 7.0 (GraphPadPrism Software Inc. San Diego, California,
       USA). Wilcoxon two-side or Friedman tests were used to compare quantitative
       parameters obtained from the same samples exposed to vehicle or heme, with
       or without TNF-α. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using
       Dunn`s test. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant.
       Results and discussion
       Heme induces TF gene expression in PBMCs
       Heme has been previously shown to induce procoagulant activity in whole blood
       12                                                                  10
         , and to activate TF activity in monocytes                          . Here we explored whether this
       effect was dependent on hematopoietic TF gene expression. When compared
       to vehicle, heme significantly induced TF gene expression measured by qPCR
       in PBMC after 4h of incubation (Figure 1). The induction was evident with heme
       concentrations above 10μM, suggesting a dose dependent effect.
       Heme triggers TF procoagulant activity
       We next explored the effects of heme on TF activation. Heme 30μM induced a
       significant increase in TF procoagulant activity of PBMCs when compared to
       vehicle, and this effect was enhanced by priming cells with TNF-α prior to heme
       stimulation (Figure 2A). We also demonstrated that heme-induced TF activation
       seems to be dose dependent (Figure 2B). TNF-α alone at a concentration of
       2ng/ml was not able to induce TF procoagulant activity.

       Figure 1: Evaluation of F3 mRNA expression in mononuclear cells by qPCR.
       PBMCs were used to perform qPCR after 4h of incubation with vehicle and
       heme at different concentrations. Results were expressed in arbitrary units (AU)
       as median of normalized F3 expression using two stably expressed reference
       transcripts EEF2 (ENST00000309311) and MYH9 (ENST00000216181).
       Comparisons were made between vehicle and increasing concentrations of
       heme and showed that heme induces TF mRNA expression in a dose response
       fashion.         Friedman test was performed and multiple comparisons were
       corrected using the Dunn`s test; a p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant;
       seven samples were analyzed.

       hypothesized that heme might also be capable of inducing procoagulant activity
       in plasma. Accordingly, using a one-stage coagulometric assay we were able to
       show that heme induces procoagulant activity in plasma separated from whole
       blood after 4 hours of incubation with heme (Figure 2C).

       procoagulant activity through TLR4 by using Tak-242, which was capable to
       revert heme-induced TF PCA (Figure 2D).

       SCD is characterized by increased risk of venous thromboembolism                                          . Heme
       has been implicated as a mediator of hypercoagulability in SCD by indirect
       evidence of its effects on innate immunity, and by a study in an animal model of
                                                                                                                         10
       SCD, which showed that heme effects are mediated by TF activation in mice                                            .
       In order to gain insights into the mechanisms of hypercoagulability in SCD and
       other hemolytic anemias, we explored additional details of heme-induced
       coagulation activation in human mononuclear cells. In this context, the most
       important results of our study were the demonstration that heme is capable of
       inducing both mRNA expression and activation of hematopoietic TF in a dose-
       dependent and TLR-mediated fashion.
       Using a global hemostasis assay, we recently demonstrated that heme was
       capable of coagulation activation in whole blood and that this effect was more
                                                                                          12
       related to the kinetic of clot formation than its intensity                           . Although it has been
       demonstrated that heme can trigger TF expression in endothelial cells, studies
       using endotoxemia models have shown that hematopoietic TF is more relevant
                                                  28
       for coagulation activation                   , and in fact heme has been previously shown to
                                               10
       active TF in monocytes                    . Here we provide additional details about the effects
       of heme on the expression and activation of hematopoietic TF, confirming it
       using two different coagulometric assays, and that these effects are dose-
       dependent.
        Pathogenesis of hypercoagulability in SCD is multifactorial and involves
                                                                                   3,29
       crosstalk with other inflammatory pathways                                      . Accordingly, we also
       demonstrated that heme-induced TF PCA was potentiated by TNF-α. Of note,
       synergy of heme with other pro-inflammatory mediators have been previously
       described in experiments involving LPS stimulation 30 and in an in vitro model of
                                                                               11
       NETosis in neutrophils pretreated with TNF-α                              . However, as far as we are
       aware, there are no reports of a priming effect of TNF-α in TF activation.
       Moreover, similar to what is described with other compartment of innate
                      11,26
       immunity             , we also demonstrated that heme-induced TF activation is TLR-
       dependent.

       In conclusion, we demonstrate that heme, an ubiquitous molecule that is
       released in several clinical conditions associated with hemolysis can trigger
       both TF mRNA expression and TF activation in human hematopoietic cells, and
       that this effect was dependent on TLR4 receptors. These results reinforce the
       concept that free heme may play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of
       hypercoagulability in SCD, as well as in other hemolytic conditions whose
       physiopathology involve hypercoagulability.
