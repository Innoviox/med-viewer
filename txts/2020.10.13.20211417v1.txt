    Abstract
    Background: Endogenous apoliloprotein E mediates neuroinflammatory responses and recovery
    after brain injury. Exogenously administered apolipoprotein E-mimetic peptides can effectively
    penetrate the brain and down-regulate acute inflammation. CN-105 is a novel apolipoprotein E-
    mimetic pentapeptide with excellent preclinical evidence as an acute intracerebral hemorrhage
    (ICH) therapeutic. The CN-105 in participants with Acute supraTentorial intraCerebral
    Hemorrhage (CATCH) trial is a first-in-disease-state, multi-center, open-label trial evaluating
    safety and feasability of CN-105 administration in patients with acute primary supratentorial ICH.
    Methods: Eligible patients were age 30-80 years, had confirmed primary supratentorial ICH, and
    able to intiate CN-105 administration (1.0 mg/kg every 6 hours for 72 hours) within 12 hours of
    symptom          onset.        A      priori   defined       safety   endpoints,        including      hematoma         volume,
    pharmacokinetics, and 30-day neurological outcomes were analyzed. For comparisons, CATCH
    participants were matched 1:1 with a contemporary ICH cohort through random selection.
    Hematoma volumes determined from computed tomography images on Days 0, 1, 2, and 5 and
    ordinal modified Rankin Score at 30 days after ICH were compared.
    Results: In 39 participants enrolled across six study sites in the United States, adverse events
    occurred at expected rate without increase in hematoma expansion or neurological deterioration
    or significant serum accumulation. CN-105 treatment had an odds ratio (95% confidence interval)
    of 2.69 (1.31–5.51) for lower 30-day mRS, after adjustment for ICH Score, sex, and race/ethnicity,
    compared to matched contemporary cohort.
    Conclusion: CN-105 administration represents an excellent translational candidate as an actue
    ICH therapeutic due to its safety, dosing feasibility, favorable pharmacokinetics, and evidence of
    improved neurological recovery.

    Introduction
         Spontaneous non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 10-15% of all
    strokes, with an incidence of approximately 25 per 100,000 worldwide.1 ICH is also associated
    with disproportionate morbidity and mortality as compared to other forms of stroke, and nearly
    half of afflicted patients will die within 30 days of hemorrhage.2 Despite the high personal, societal,
    and financial impact of ICH, little improvement has been made in ICH-related mortality over the
    last two decades, and effective pharmacological treatments for ICH remain a compelling unmet
    need.3, 4
         Although recent clinical trials have focused on interventions to reduce hematoma extension
    after ICH via reduction of blood pressure,5,                     6
                                                                       manipulation of the coagulation system,7-9 and
    minimaly invasive evacuation techniques,10 another viable strategy may be targeting
    neuroinflammatory responses. The acute CNS response to ICH is characterized by the
    recruitment of hematogenous inflammatory cells and the activation of endogenous microglia and
    astrocytes. This process leads to up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, production of free
    radicals, and neuronal excitotoxicity. These neuroinflammatory responses contribute to oxidative
    injury, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and secondary tissue injury.11 Thus, reduction of the
    acute neuroinflammatory response may result in reduced secondary tissue injury and improved
    outcomes.
         Apoliloprotein E (apoE) is a key mediator of the neuroinflammatory response and recovery
    from brain injury.12,          13
                                       Three common human apoE isoforms, designated apoE2, apoE3 and
    apoE4, differ by single cysteine to arginine substitutions at positions 112 and 158. ApoE3 plays
    an adaptive role in downregulating glial activation and reducing secondary neuronal injury.14-16
    Conversely, apoE4 is associated with increased inflammation and poor neurobehavioral
    outcome.17, 18 We have previously demonstrated that small apoE-mimetic peptides can effectively
    penetrate the brain and down regulate acute neuroinflammatory responses in vivo.13, 14, 19-27 CN-

    binding region of apoE and was optimized to retain the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective
    effects of the holoprotein, while retaining good CNS penetration and minimal toxicity.28 In a
    randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 trial, escalating and repeated doses of CN-105 were
    found to be safe and well tolerated in healthy adults.29
         Now, we report the results of a first-in-disease-state, multi-center, open-label trial evaluating
    safety and feasability of CN-105 administration in patients with acute primary supratentorial ICH.
    We also report CN-105 effects on hematoma volume, 30-day mortality, and neurological
    outcomes, including comparisons with matched controls from a large contemporary cohort.
    Methods
         The CN-105 in participants with Acute supraTentorial intraCerebral Hemorrhage (CATCH)
    Trial was designed as a multicenter, open label, phase 2 trial of CN-105 in patients with acute
    primary supratentorial ICH. The primary objective of the study was to assess safety and feasability
    of CN-105 administration within 12 hours of acute primary ICH. Secondary objectives of the study
    were to define the pharmacokinetic profile of CN-105 in this patent population, determine target
    engagement, and evaluate early signals of therapeutic efficacy. CATCH was approved by the
    central institutional review board Copernicus Group Independent Review Board and by each
    participating sites’ institutional review board and has been performed in accordance with the
    ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.
    Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.
    Study Population
         CATCH enrolled a total of 39 participants across six study sites in the United States. To be
    eligible for participation, patients had to be age 30-80 years (inclusive), have a radiographically
    confirmed diagnosis of primary supratentorial ICH, and have CN-105 administration initiated
    within 12 hours of symptom onset. A full set of inclusion and exclusion criteria may be found in

    Supplementary Table 1. CN-105 treated participants were compared to a matched cohort of
    participants drawn from the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study,
    a cohort of 3000 patients with ICH prospectively assembled between 2010 and 2015.30 CATCH
    subjects were matched for admission ICH Score,31 sex, and race/ethnicity. Supplemental Figure
    demonstrates the ERICH-CATCH matching process.
    Study Procedures
         Patients meeting eligibility criteria for the trial were approached for consent. After consent was
    signed by the patient or their legal authorized representative, participants received intravenous
    CN-105 administered over 30 minutes, at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg every six hours for up to a maximum
    of 13 doses (72 hours) or until discharge. Participants were monitored daily throughout the
    treatment phase of the study (up to a maximum of five days) and received standard of care as
    determined by their attending physician for the duration of the study. The ICH score31 was
    calculated for each patient at screening. Severity of neurological deficit was assessed using the
    National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score (NIHSS) and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) on
    presentation, and daily for 5 days after ICH onset, death or discharge. After discharge from the
    hospital, participants entered a three-month follow up phase with in-person clinic visit at 30 days
    and a follow-up telephone interview at 90 days.
    Safety Endpoints
         Adverse events (AE) were recorded starting immediately after obtaining informed consent and
    extending through the last study-related procedure completed up to Day 90 follow up phone call.
    At each study visit, the study teams queried about AEs and Serious AEs (SAE) since the last
    study visit. Events were followed for outcome information until resolution, stabilization, or end of
    study. A priori defined safety endpoints included: 1) number and severity of AEs/SAEs throughout
    study duration; 2) in-hospital 30- and 90-day mortality; 3) treatment-related mortality; 4) in-hospital

    neurological deterioration, defined as an increase of NIHSS>2 from baseline, persisting more than
    24 hours and unrelated to sedation; 5) incidence of cerebritis, meningitis, ventriculitis; 6) incidence
    of systemic infection; and 7) incidence of hematoma expansion >30% from baseline computed
    tomography (CT) head imaging.
    Pharmacokinetic Analyses
         A subpopulation of 7 participants receiving CN-105 underwent serial blood sampling for
    noncompartmental pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling. PK samples were collected prior to dosing
    (within 1 hour), 0.083, 0.167, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 5.5 hours after start of each dose for the first 2 doses,
    prior to dosing (within 1 hour) for each of doses 3 to 13 and 0.083, 0.167, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24
    hours after the last dose (dose 13). Plasma CN-105 concentrations were determined by MPI
    Research (Mattawan, Michigan). Plasma samples were stored in 1% HALT with K2EDTA at –
    70°C before analysis. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed
    using a positive Turbo IonSpray® interface on a Sciex API-5000 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
    California) and multiple reaction monitoring. The analytical range was 1.00 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL.
    The assay precision in quality-control samples was <20% for the lowest limit of quantitation and
    < 15% for all other concentrations.
    Imaging Outcomes
         All participants underwent initial diagnostic CT scans for confirmation of ICH and presence of
    any underlying structural or vasular abnormality which would preclude eligibility. All participants
    underwent follow-up CT scans were performed at 24 hours (Day 1), 48 hours (Day 2) and 120
    hours (Day 5) after initial diagnostic CT. For each CT scan, hematoma location, volume, and
    intraventricular extension were determined. Hematoma volumes were measured using previously
    described techniques for semiautomated segmentation on commercially available software
    (AnalyzePro v 1.0; AnanlyzeDirect, Inc., Chicago, IL).32 Briefly, hematoma boundaries were

    established by using an edge-detection tool using an attenuation threshhold range of 42-100
    Hounsfield Units. Intial segmentation by the tool was reviewed and adjusted by study
    neuroradiologist to ensure accuracy before hematoma volumes were automatically calculated
    from the segmented images.
    Neurological Outcomes
         Investigation-related clinical examinations were performed at screening and then daily for the
    first 5 days or until hospital discharge, whichever came first. After discharge, in-person clinic visit
    was performed at 30 days and a telephone interview at 90 days after enrollment. Modified Rankin
    Scale (mRS), NIHSS, Stroke Impact Scale-16, Barthel Index and Montreal Cognitive Assessment
    were used to assess CN-105 effects on neurological and cognitive function. Comparison of 30-
    day mRS between participants treated with CN-105 and matched ERICH controls was the primary
    analysis of efficacy.
    Statistical Approach
         All participants who received at least one dose of CN-105 were included in analysis of safety
    outcomes using descriptive methods. For comparison with the ERICH study, CATCH and ERICH
    participants were matched 1:1 based on initial ICH score and sex through random selection from
    a sampling frame of 240 eligible controls (Supplemental Figure). Hematoma volumes determined
    from CT images on Days 0, 1, 2, and 5 were compared descriptively to matched ERICH
    participants CT images on Days 0-5 after ICH using box plots. Noncompartmental PK analysis
    was performed using the Phoenix WinNonlin (version 6.3) software. Analysis of mRS was based
    on rational imputation as follows: three participants were lost to follow-up after discharge from the
    hospital to home (two were lost to follow-up at Days 30 and 90 and one at Day 90 only). These
    missing values were imputed with their last observed value, given their discharge to home
    (mRS=2 for 2 participants and mRS=1 for one participant). Three participants had interior missing

    data at Day 30 which was imputed as their Day 5 observed value (mRS=4 for all 3 participants).
    Distribution of Day 30 mRS was compared between CATCH and matched controls from the
    ERICH study using a proportional odds model with the robust (sandwich) variance estimator.
    Additional sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate results after adjustment for race and
    age. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are reported from the proportional odds model. All
    statistical tests were 2-sided and used alpha=0.05. Analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4 (SAS
    Institute, Cary, NC).
    Results
         Between August 2017 and March 2019, 39 patients with acute ICH at six participating medical
    centers were consented. One patient was excluded after consent due to ICH secondary to
    aneurysm; all 38 participants enrolled into the study received CN-105 with 35 participants
    receiving their first dose less than 12 hours from ICH onset,10 first doses occurring in under 6
    hours, and 23 participants completing all 3 days of dosing. CATCH participants were matched 1:1
    to ERICH participants. Characteristics of the study and comparator cohorts are summarized in
    Table 1.
         Non-serious AEs are summarized in Table 2. No significant safety concerns were identified
    with CN-105 administration in participants with ICH. Throughout the study, vital signs were stable
    and did not change significantly. No participant experienced changes in electrocardiogram
    parameters. Clinical chemistry, blood counts, coagulation profiles, and lipid parameters were
    stable and did not change significantly throughout the course of the study. No participants
    experienced central nervous system (CNS) infection. Fourteen nonfatal SAEs were experienced
    by 12 (32%) participants, reported most commonly in the Nervous System and Respiratory
    Disorders with 4 events in each category. All SAEs are listed in Supplemental Table 2. Thirty-one
    (82%) participants experienced a treatment emergent AE, summarized in Table 2. The most
    commonly experienced treatment emergent AEs (≥15% of participants) were pain (29%),

    constipation (26%), leukocytosis (24%), hypophosphatemia (21%), hypomagnesemia (18%),
    hyponatremia (18%), nausea (18%), and pyrexia (16%). Non-serious treatment emergent AEs
    are listed in Supplemental Table 3. Eleven treatment emergent SAE’s were experienced by 9
    (24%) participants (Supplemental Table 4), ultimately deemed unlikely related to study drug. Five
    (13%) participants experienced in-hospital neurological deterioration during the course of the
    study. Nine (24%) participants had incidence of hemorrhage extension throughout the study, one
    with clinical deterioration. Mean (SD) hematoma volumes by CT were 22.8 (23.7), 25.1 (25.1),
    21.9 (24.9), and 19.7 (19.6) cm3 on admission, Day 1, Day 2, and Day 5 after ICH, respectively.
    These volumes were comparable to hematoma volumes in matched ERICH participants with ICH
    (Figure 1). Two (5%) participants received treatment for elevated intracranial pressure; both
    participants died in-hospital due to brain herniation from the index ICH. Three (8%) participants
    died prior to 30-day follow up. All 3 participants experienced in-hospital mortality due to adverse
    events related to the primary disease and within 6 days of the first dose of CN-105.
         As shown in Figure 2, trough plasma concentrations for all subjects after Dose 1 demonstrated
    comparable exposures without evidence of clinically significant accumulation. Mean (SD)
    maximum concentrations were 5610.0 ng/mL (1335.1), 6296.7 ng/mL (2155.8), and 5638.3 ng/mL
    (1335.9) for dose 1, 2, and 13, respectively. The mean (SD) area under the curve (AUC) were
    11206.2 ng*hr/mL (3863.4), 12936.4 ng*hr/mL (4983.6), 13347.0 ng*hr/mL (3369.1) for dose 1,
    2, and 13, respectively. Accumulation of drug during multiple dosing was minimal with mean (SD)
    ratios of 1.2 (0.1) and 1.3 (0.4) of Dose 1:Dose 2 and Dose 1:Dose 13 AUCs, respectively. Starting
    from Dose 4, trough concentrations after each dose were not significantly different from the
    subsequent doses, through Dose 13. Table 3 demonstrates PK parameters of CN-105 after acute
    ICH. Plasma concentrations of CN-105 in one participant were less than 4% of mean
    concentrations of other participants from 5 minutes after the start of of the initial infusion to 0.5
    hours after the stop of infusion. Because of the grossly abnormal PK profile in this participant after
    Dose 1, the paticipant’s measurements were censored.

         A priori primary neurological outcome was mRS from in-person 30 day assessment.
    Compared to matched participants in the ERICH study, CATCH trial participants had significantly
    improved 30-day mRS outcomes (Figure 3). Secondary analyses of mRS, NIHSS, Stroke Impact
    Scale-16, Barthel Index, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment at hospital discharge and 30 days
    after ICH are summarized in Supplemental Table 5; however, the ERICH study lacked appropriate
    comparator data for these outcomes. Over the course of CN-105 treatment, NIHSS improved
    from median (range) of 12.0 (4.0, 25.0) to 8.5 (1.0, 29.0). Similarly, mRS in CATCH participants
    improved from Day 5 through Day 90 (Figure 3).
    Discussion
         Administration of 1.0 mg/kg CN-105 every 6 hours for 72 hours is safe and feasible when
    intiated within 12 hours of spontaneous ICH. In this critically ill population of patients with acute
    ICH, SAEs and AEs occurred at a rate expected from our other clinical trials. Further, CN-105
    was not associated with an increase in hematoma expansion or unanticipated neurological
    deterioration. CN-105 PK in this cohort of participants with ICH was similar to the previously
    reported PK in healthy subjects, without significant accumulation and reaching steady state after
    the fourth dose. Finally, treatment with CN-105 was associated with improved 30-day neurological
    outcomes as compared to contemporary cohort of closely matched participants from the ERICH
    database.
         Development of the novel apoE-mimetic pentapeptide, CN-105, was based on initial
    observations that apoE exerted anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in the CNS.33, 34
    Based on evidence suggesting that these adaptive responses were mediated via interactions with
    the LRP-1 receptor,16, 35-37 a series of apoE-mimetic peptides with therapeutic potential were
    rationally developed from the apoE receptor binding region.38-41 These peptides improved
    functional outcomes in a wide variety of preclinical cerebrovascular and traumatic brain injury
    models.42 CN-105 was developed from the polar face of the apoE-receptor binding region, and

    has advantages of increased CNS permeability, potency, and ease of manufacturing as compared
    to prior apoE-mimetic peptides, which were larger and often contained non-naturally occuring
    amino acids.41 Although the exact mechanism(s) by which CN-105 exerts its protective effects
    remain incompletely defined, CN-105 improves neurobehavioral outcomes across a variety of
    preclinical models of acute CNS injuries, including ICH, subarachnoid hemorrhage, ischemic
    stroke, and traumatic brain injury.43-46
         APOE genotype correlates with hematoma volume after human ICH.47, 48 Thus, effects of CN-
    105 on hematoma expansion and volume after acute human ICH was a critical a priori safety
    concern. Fortunately, exogenous administration of apoE-mimetic therapies in experimental ICH
    models has not resulted in greater hematoma volumes or expansion.14, 22, 24, 44 In the present
    study, hematoma volume was unaffected by treatment with CN-105. In fact, injury modifying
    effects of CN-105 are unlikely to be related to hematoma formation, expansion, or reduction,
    based on preclincal findings. Rather, evidence suggests that CN-105 reduces brain injury by
    modifying glial activation and resultant cerebral edema.43-46 Since rate of brain edema formation
    and degree of edema generated has been associated with ICH outcome, CN-105 represents an
    excellent therapeutic strategy for reducing secondary tissue injury after ICH.32 Ongoing work to
    analyze and compare serum biomarkers of CNS injury and inflammation, as well as
    perihematomal edema imaging, from participants treated with CN-105 to those not receiving CN-
    105 is currently underway. Optimization of planned, future Phase 2/3 trials will incorporate these
    radiographic and biochemical surrogates.
              Given its safety and efficacy across a wide variety of preclinical brain injury models, CN-
    105 is a logical, favorable candidate for clinical translation. However, a large number of promising
    neuroprotective therapies have failed to successfully translate to improved clinical outcomes,49
    often due to inadequate preclinical modelling.3 To increase probability of successful translation,
    extensive preclinical studies were performed to demonstrate therapeutic effect of CN-105 in

    various models of ICH across age, species, and sex (Wang et al., 2020 Neurocrit Care; under
    review). Further, hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with ICH (e.g., in this study
    21/38 participants were hypertensive, based on blood pressure measurements of systolic ≥140
    mmHg or diastolic ≥90 mmHg at screening). Therefore, therapeutic efficacy of CN-105 in the
    setting of hypertensive comorbidity has also been successfully adressed in preclinical studies
    (Wang et al., 2020, Neurocrit Care; under review).
         Several limitations in the current study should be adressed. Although participants with ICH
    dosed with CN-105 clearly demonstrated improvement in mRS over time, absence of randomized,
    contemporaneous placebo-controlled comparator group does not definitively allow us to separate
    the natural history of recovery from the effect of an investigational drug. However, 30-day mRS
    of CN-105 treated participants were significantly improved relative to a carefully matched,
    contemporary cohort of participants drawn from the robustly phenotyped ERICH database, which
    suggests therapeutic benefit. Unfortunately, comparison for other secondary outcome measures,
    including NIHSS, Stroke Impact Scale-16, Barthel Index, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment
    was not possible using the matched cohort from ERICH. However, comparison of these measures
    against other published clinical trial cohorts do suggest that CN-105 administration may improve
    neurocognitive outcomes after ICH to a greater degree than might be otherwise expected.7, 10, 50-
    52
       Thus, given positive results in clinically relevant ICH preclinical paradigms across species, sex,
    age, and comorbid hypertension44 (Wang et al., 2020 Neurocrit Care; under review), predictable
    and linear PK profile with favorable safety signal found in prior Phase 1 trial29 and the current
    study, and encouraging safety profile in patients with ICH, CN-105 represents an attractive
    candidate for clinical translation.
    Conclusion
         In this critically ill population of patients with acute ICH, treatment with 1.0 mg/kg of CN-105
    administered every six hours for up to three days is safe and feasible with no evidence of drug-

    related hematoma expansion or neurological deterioration. Treatment with CN-105 was
    associated with improved mRS at 30 days after ICH when compared to the natural history of a
    closely matched, contemporary cohort. Due to the open label design, absence of placebo
    comparator group, or long term functional endpoints, the present results should be interpreted
    with caution. However, given the wealth of supportive precinical data, favorable PK profile, and
    clinical safety, CN-105 represents a promising candidate for translation to more definitive efficacy
    trials in acute ICH incorporating surrogate serological and brain imaging endpoints.

    Supplemental Table 2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
    Inclusion Criteria:
    1. Had given written informed consent to participate in the study in accordance with required
    regulations; if a participant was not capable of providing informed consent, written consent must
    be obtained from the participant’s legally authorized representative.
    2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the duration of the
    study.
    3. Was male or female, age 30 to 80 years, inclusive.
    4. Had a confirmed diagnosis of spontaneous supratentorial ICH.
    5. Able to receive first dose of study drug ≤12 hours after onset of ICH symptoms, such as
    alteration in level of consciousness, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, seizure, and/or focal
    neurological deficits, or last known well time.
    6. Had an interpretable and measurable diagnostic CT scan.
    7. Had a GCS score ≥ 5 on presentation
    8. Had a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≥ 4
    9. Had systolic blood pressure< 200mmHg at enrollment.
    Exclusion Criteria:
    1. Known pregnancy and lactation.
    2. Has a temperature greater than 38.5°C at screening.
    3. ICH known to result from trauma.
    4. Evidence of infratentorial hemorrhage (any involvement of the midbrain or lower brainstem as
    demonstrated by radiograph or complete third nerve palsy) severely limiting the recovery
    potential of the patient in the opinion of the investigator.
    5. Evidence of primary intraventricular hemorrhage deemed to be at high risk for obstructive
    hydrocephalus, in the opinion of the investigator or evidence of extra-axial (ie, subarachnoid or
    subdural) extension of hemorrhage severely limiting the recovery potential of thepatient in the
    opinion of the investigator.
    6. Radiographic evidence of underlying tumor.
    7. Known unstable mass or active radiographic evidence and symptoms of herniation
    syndromes severely limiting the recovery potential of the patient in the opinion of the
    investigator.
    8. Known ruptured aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or vascular anomaly.
    9. Had a platelet count < 100,000/mL.
    10. Had an international normalized ratio> 1.5 or irreversible coagulopathy either due to medical
    condition or detected before screening.
    11. Was taking new oral anticoagulants or low molecular weight heparin at the time of ICH
    onset.
    12. In the opinion of the investigator was unstable and would have benefited from supportive
    care rather than supportive care plus CN-105.
    13. In the opinion of the investigator had any contraindication to the planned study
    assessments, including CT and MRI.
    14. Any condition which could interfere with, or the treatment for which might interfere with, the
    conduct of the study or which, in the opinion of the investigator, unacceptably increases the
    individual’s risk by participating in the study.
    15. Concomitant enrollment in another interventional study.
