                                                             ABSTRACT

           Background: Serum albumin has a close correlation with degree of malnutrition which is

           associated with poor outcome and quality of life after cardiac surgery. Hypoalbuminemia is

           associated with increased wound infection, prolonged hospital stay and death after major

           surgery. Hence, preoperative serum albumin level can be utilized to upgrade risk models which

           will further benefit the cardiac surgical patients without extra financial burden.

           Objective of this study was to evaluate the role of serum albumin as a predictor of morbidity

           and mortality after valve replacement surgery.


           Methods: This comparative cross-sectional study was carried out at the department of cardiac

           surgery in BSMMU. The study population was 50, with two groups having 25 patients each.

           Grouping of patients were done with respect to a preset cut off value for serum albumin. The

           period of study was from August, 2018 to February, 2020 and purposive sampling method was

           applied for this study. Data was collected by using a standardized semi-structured questionnaire

           and face to face interview.


           Results: By demographic characteristics, mean age was significantly higher in group B

           (49.96±8.69 years) than in group A (41.60±11.16 years) (p=0.005). Mean BMI was lower in

           group B (20.88±3.71 kg/m2) than in group A (22.26±1.67 kg/m2), which was found statistically

           significant (p=0.006). In terms of postoperative outcome, total chest drain collection was

           significantly higher in group B (968.80±183.49 ml) than in group A (816.00±113.40 ml),

           (p=0.001). Duration of ICU stay were significantly longer in group B (4.60±0.76 days) than in

           group A (3.92±0.86 days) (p=0.005). Similarly, duration of hospital stay was significantly

           longer in group B (9.88±1.56 days) than in group A (8.64±0.81 days) (p=0.001). Overall

           morbidity was significantly higher in group B (48%) than in group A (20%) (p<0.05). Mortality

           rate was higher in group B (12%) than in group A (4%), but that was not found statistically
                                                                     xii

            significant (p>0.05). Pearson co-efficient correlation test showed strong inverse relationship

            of serum albumin with total chest drain, ICU stay and hospital stay following valve

            replacement surgery (r= -0.473, r= -0.448 & r= -0.487 respectively), which was most

            significant than age and BMI (p≤0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done

            to assess the predictive value of serum albumin level, age and BMI, where preoperative

            serum albumin level was found to be the most valuable predictor of postoperative morbidity

            after valve replacement surgery (B= -2.251, OR 0.105, 95% CI 0.011-0.986, p<0.05).

           Conclusion: This study demonstrated that preoperative low serum albumin level is associated

           with increased morbidity and mortality after valve replacement surgery. Hence, preoperative

           serum albumin level can be used as a reliable predictor of postoperative outcome following valve

           replacement surgery.

           Introduction

           Serum albumin is a commonly used indicator of nutritional status. It is a reliable and

           reproducible predictor of general surgical risk and has a close correlation with the degree of

           malnutrition. Malnutrition is a common problem in surgical patients that adversely affects

           outcome. It is strongly associated with postoperative complications and is a predictor of
                                                                 [1]
           outcome, longer hospital stay and death                     . Preoperative malnutrition is more common in

           patients of valvular heart disease and is associated with increased morbidity and a poor

           quality of life after cardiac surgery. Therefore, it is important for operative risk stratification

           of patients with malnutrition, who may benefit from optimization of nutrition prior to surgery
           [2]
                 .

           Albumin has been considered a negative acute-phase protein because its concentration

           decreases during injury and sepsis. Research on adult patients in various situations has shown
                                                                                        [3]
           the usefulness of this protein as a predictor of mortality                         . It is an important protein of

           human plasma. It represents 60% of the total plasma protein pool. Among the important

           physiological functions of albumin are maintenance of plasma oncotic pressure and the

           binding of several molecules, including fatty acids, bilirubin, metals, hormones, and drugs. It

           also acts as a free radical scavenger and reservoir for nitric oxide [4].

           Recently it has been demonstrated that immediate postoperative hypoalbuminemia predicts

           poorer outcome and increased hospital stay after adult cardiac surgery. Postoperative

           hypoalbuminemia is common in patients undergoing major surgery. Several factors are

           responsible for this such as dilution secondary to fluid resuscitation, increased catabolism and

           reduction of synthesis, loss because of hemorrhage, gut loss, and redistribution secondary to

           altered vascular permeability. The degree of capillary permeability may be proportionate to

           the systemic inflammatory response, hence creates a greater rate of vascular permeability. In

           addition, increased blood loss and intraoperative administration of large fluid volumes further



                                                                        5

           decrease serum albumin concentration. Therefore, patients having low serum albumin

           preoperatively are at greater risk of complications after surgery [5].

           Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor tissue healing, decreased collagen synthesis and

           granuloma formation in surgical wounds. These factors contribute to delayed wound healing,

           increased wound dead space, and create an environment that predispose to infection. It is also

           associated with impairment of macrophage activation and induces macrophage apoptosis,

           thus causes impairment of the innate immune response. Furthermore, it causes tissue edema

           due to reduction in plasma colloid osmotic pressure, which provides a medium for bacterial

           propagation. Combined, all these factors could promote wound infection after surgery and

           increase duration of stay in hospital [6].

           Hypoalbuminemia before major non-cardiac surgery has been associated with increased

           wound infection, mortality and length of stay in hospital. It has been considered strong

           predictor of postoperative renal dysfunction and infection. Among body mass index and

           serum cholesterol as possible confounders, hypoalbuminemia has been shown to be an

           independent risk factor for poor short term surgical outcome. That’s why it is part of the

           commonly used prognostic system ‘APACHE’ (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health

           Evaluation), which predicts mortality among critically ill medical and surgical patients.

           Along with diabetes mellitus, low postoperative cardiac output, duration of operation, age,

           obesity and previous cardiac surgery, hypoalbuminemia indicates a high risk of infection

           among patients who undergo open-heart surgery [7].

           Previously no study has been done in Bangladesh to see the association of serum albumin

           with postoperative morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery. The aim of present study

           was to establish preoperative serum albumin concentration as a reliable predictor of

           morbidity and mortality after valve replacement surgery.

           Objective

           To evaluate the role of preoperative serum albumin level as a predictor of postoperative

           morbidity and mortality following valve replacement surgery.



           Materials & Methods
           This comparative cross-sectional study was carried out at the department of cardiac surgery in

           BSMMU. The study population was 50, with two groups having 25 patients each. Grouping

           of patients were done with respect to a preset cut off value for serum albumin (Group A:

           preoperative serum albumin level ≥ 3.5 gm/dl, Group B: preoperative serum albumin level <

           3.5 gm/dl). The period of study was from August, 2018 to February, 2020 and purposive

           sampling method was applied for this study. Data was collected by using a standardized semi-

           structured questionnaire and face to face interview.



           Data Collection:

           All patients admitted in cardiac surgery department for elective cardiac valve replacement

           surgery without exclusion criteria were considered for study population. Patient who fulfilled

           the inclusion criteria and willing to enroll in the study was included in the study after

           receiving the proper consent. Preoperative serum albumin level was measured in each subject

           in Biochemistry laboratory, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. Preoperative

           serum albumin level was measured according to Doumas, Watson and Biggs Method.

           Amount of specimen needed from each subject is 2 µL. To obtain this, after all aseptic

           precaution, venous blood sample was collected from each study subject in a disposable

           plastic syringe and immediately transferred to a sterile tube without any anticoagulant. Blood

           is allowed to clot freely in the tube. Then tubes were labeled with patients name, ID number

           & collection date and sent to Biochemistry laboratory immediately for centrifugation &


                                                                      7

           further procedure. Patients who had preoperative serum albumin level ≥ 3.5 gm/dl were

           included in group A and who had preoperative serum albumin level <3.5 gm/dl.



           Data Analysis

           Statistical analysis was conducted using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS)

           version 23.0 for windows software. Comparisons between groups were made with descriptive

           statistics like mean, frequency, range, standard deviation etc. and inferential statistics like

           Student’s t-test, Chi-Square test, Fisher’s exact test etc. Observations were recorded as

           statistically significant if a p-value is ≤0.05.

           Results
           Total fifty (50) patients who underwent valve replacement surgery were evaluated in this

           study as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Venous blood samples to determine serum

           albumin level was collected preoperatively.

           Among the study population mean age in group A was 41.60±11.16 years and in group B was

           49.96±8.69 years. The difference in age between two groups was statistically significant

           (p<0.05). There was no statistical significance of gender between the two study groups

           (p>0.05). The mean BMI in group A was 22.26±1.67 kg/m² and that in group B was

           20.88±1.69 kg/m². The findings were statistically significant (p<0.05).

           The relationship between baseline predictors and postoperative morbidity following valve

           replacement surgery were assessed by the use of logistic regression analysis. Among the

           variables, the preoperative serum albumin level was found to be the most valuable predictor

           (B= -2.251, OR 0.105, 95% CI 0.011-0.986, p<0.05).

           Discussion

           This study aimed to find the impact of preoperative plasma albumin level for predicting in-

           hospital morbidity and mortality after valve replacement surgery. Valve replacement surgery

           was performed maintaining standard operative protocol and postoperative care was given to

           the patients of both groups as per standard protocol.

           The demographic variables of the participating patients were recorded and analyzed. The

           mean age for group A was 41.60±11.16 years and group B was 49.96±8.69 years

           respectively, the difference was statistically significant (p=0.005). The age range of the

           patients of this study was from 22 years to 67 years. This study observed that the incidence of

           low serum albumin level and postoperative morbidity were more common in old age. A

           similar study carried out by Wei et al., showed serum albumin level and relation to age was

           statistically significant (p=0.005) [3].

           In group A, approximately half of the population were male 13 (52%) and half were female

           12 (48%). In group B, male and female patients were 16 (64%) and 09 (36%) respectively.

           The distribution of gender between two groups were not statistically significant (p=0.390).

           Similar findings were published by Koertzen et al., in their research [8].

           When average BMI was compared between the two groups, it was 22.26±1.67 kg/m2 in

           Group A and 20.88±3.71 kg/m2 in Group B. The difference was statistically significant

           (p=0.006). This study observed that low serum albumin level and low BMI are associated

           with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, which correlates to the findings of

           Bhamidipati et al., in their study [1]. Demographic and anthropometric data are listed in Table

           1.

           Among the preoperative echocardiographic parameter ejection fraction (EF) was compared

           between group A and group B. The difference of EF in between the two groups was not

           statistically significant (p=0.945). Group A had a mean EF of 47.00±6.47 % and that of


                                                                     14

           group B was 47.12±5.64 %. Cruz et al., reported similar findings in their study [7].



           Regarding peroperative variables, mean cross clamp time, total CPB time & duration of

           surgery in group A were 76.44±33.91 minutes, 128.56±52.15 minutes and 249.00±73.78

           minutes and in group B were 96.40±40.87 minutes, 154.80±62.22 minutes and 281.60±85.84

           minutes respectively. Differences between two groups were statistically not significant

           (p=0.066, p=0.113, p=0.159 respectively). Engelman et al., published similar findings in their

           study [9].

           Number of valve replaced and type of prosthetic valve used were also compared between two

           groups statistically. In most of the patients single valve replacement were done which is 19

           patients (76%) in group A and 18 patients (72%) in group B whereas double valve

           replacement were done in 6 patients (24%) in group A and 7 patients (28%) in group B. The

           differences were statistically not significant (p=0.747). There were also no statistical

           significance in terms of whether mechanical or tissue valve were used as prosthetic valve

           between two groups (p=0.999). The findings corresponded with Wei et al., in their published

           reports [3].

           Postoperative outcomes variables were also compared between two groups. Total chest drain

           collection were 816.00±113.40 ml in group A and 968.80±183.49 ml in group B, which was

           statistically significant (p=0.001). Mean duration of postoperative ventilator time were

           6.78±1.26 hours in group A and 7.16±1.49 hours in group B, which was found statistically

           not significant (p=0.335). Engelman et al., published similar findings in their study [9].

           In present study, statistical significance was found in terms of duration of ICU stay and

           duration of hospital stay between two groups. Duration of ICU stay were 3.92±0.86 days in

           group A and 4.60±0.76 days in group B, which was statistically significant (p=0.005).

           Duration of hospital stay were also statistically significant (p=0.001), where in group A it was


                                                                     15

           8.64±0.81 days and in group B was 9.88±1.56 days. Koertzen et al., found similar findings in

           terms of duration of ICU stay and duration of hospital stay with p value of p<0.001 &

           p<0.005 respectively [8].

           In this study, postoperative complications like new onset arrhythmia (AF, VT and PVC),

           wound infection, stroke and re-exploration for bleeding were also studied to see any

           difference between two groups. Though wound infection was relatively higher in group B

           (16%) in comparison to group A (4%), there was no statistical significance (p=0.349). Other

           parameters were also statistically not significant (p>0.05). These findings corresponded with

           Bhamidipati et al., in their study [1].

           Regarding overall morbidity and mortality between two groups, about 5 patients (20%) of

           group A and 12 patients (48%) of group B had developed one of the morbidities mentioned

           above, which was statistically significant (p=0.037). In this study, total 4 patients (8%) died

           out of 50 patients. Among them 1 patient (4%) was in group A and 3 (12%) were in group B.

           Though mortality rate was relatively higher in group B, but that was not statistically

           significant (p=0.609). Wei et al., found statistical significance in case of both morbidity
                                                                                                                               [3]
           (p=0.001) and higher mortality rate in hypoalbuminemic group (6.6% vs 3.1%, p=0.001)                                      .

           As sample size was small in our study, mortality was not found statistically significant.

           The Pearson co-efficient correlation test for preoperative serum albumin level, BMI, age,

           total chest drain, duration of ICU stay and duration of hospital stay showed significant

           inverse relationship of serum albumin level with total chest drain, ICU stay and hospital stay

           (r= -0.473, p=0.001; r= -0.448, p=0.001; r= -0.487, p<0.001 respectively). It also showed

           preoperative serum albumin level was most significant than BMI and age (significant at the

           0.01 level) in relation to total chest drain, ICU stay and hospital stay. Bhamidipati et al., also

           found a strong inverse relationship between preoperative serum albumin level and

           postoperative outcome. They also found that albumin is a better predictor than BMI [1].

           A logistic regression analysis was done to assess the predictive value of serum albumin level,

           BMI and age for postoperative morbidity following valve replacement surgery. Among the

           other variables serum albumin level was the most valuable predictor of postoperative

           morbidity following valve replacement surgery (OR 0.105, 95% CI, 0.011-0.986; p=0.049).

           Wei et al., provided similar information in their study (Wei et al., 2017). Rady et al., also

           found that preoperative serum albumin level was associated with postoperative morbidity

           after cardiac surgery in a multivariate analysis (OR 1.37, 95% CI, 1.04-1.81; p=0.03) [10].

           As preoperative low serum albumin increases postoperative morbidity and mortality, further

           study should be done to assess the role of preoperative or peroperative albumin

           supplementation in patients with hypoalbuminemia in reducing postoperative complications.

           Conclusion

           This study found preoperative serum albumin level as a reliable predictor of postoperative

           morbidity and mortality after valve replacement surgery. Thus preoperative serum albumin

           can be used as a screening tool for identifying individuals at added risk as well as will enable

           us to take necessary steps to reduce the risk of adverse events following valve replacement

           surgery.




           Limitations

                   a. This study was conducted upon a small sample size for a limited period of time.

                   b. This analysis was done in a single center of Bangladesh and the sample only

                      represents a small fraction of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

                   c. No follow-up was conducted after the discharge of the patient. So, adverse outcomes

                      during follow-up period could not be assessed.



           Recommendations

              I.      Preoperative estimation of serum albumin level should be done routinely.

             II.      Serum albumin level should be corrected before surgery to reduce postoperative

                      adverse events and it should be used as a screening tool to identify patients at added

                      risk for adverse outcome after valve replacement surgery.

            III.      Large scale study with large sample size needed to validate the findings.

                                                                     18

           IV.      We recommend preoperative serum albumin level as a reliable predictor of

                    postoperative complications after valve replacement surgery and can be used as a risk

                    assessment tool.
