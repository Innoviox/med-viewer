26     ABSTRACT

27

28     Every year, influenza causes 290.000 to 650.000 deaths worldwide and vaccination is encouraged to

29     prevent infection in high-risk individuals. Interestingly, cross-protective effects of vaccination against

30     heterologous infections have been reported, and long-term boosting of innate immunity (also termed

31     trained immunity) has been proposed as the underlying mechanism. Several epidemiological studies

32     also suggested cross-protection between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 during the current

33     pandemic. However, the mechanism behind such an effect is unknown. Using an established in-vitro

34     model of trained immunity, we demonstrate that the quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine used in

35     the Netherlands in the 2019-2020 influenza season can induce a trained immunity response, including

36     an improvement of cytokine responses after stimulation of human immune cells with SARS-CoV-2. In

37     addition, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was less common among Dutch hospital employees who

38     had received influenza vaccination during the 2019/2020 winter season (RR = 0,61 (95% CI,

39     0.4585 - 0.8195, P = 0.001). In conclusion, a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine can induce

40     trained immunity responses against SARS-CoV-2, which may result in relative protection against

41     COVID-19. These data, coupled with similar recent independent reports, argue for a beneficial effect of

42     influenza vaccination against influenza as well as COVID-19, and suggests its effective deployment in

43     the 2020-2021 influenza season to protect against both infections.

44     INTRODUCTION


45     As of October 2020 there were over 37 million confirmed cases and one million deaths due to COVID-

46     19 [1]. In many cases, SARS-CoV-2 infections only cause mild symptoms that resolve spontaneously.

47     However, in the elderly or in patients with underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease,

48     obesity, diabetes or pre-existing lung conditions, the disease is often more severe and potentially lethal.

49     Various complications can arise and include, pulmonary edema, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory

50     distress syndrome (ARDS) and thrombotic complications among others [2]. Due to the rapid spread and

51     the high clinical and socio-economic burden of COVID-19, the efforts to prevent and combat the disease

52     have been enormous. Despite the numerous ongoing developments and clinical trials to create specific

53     vaccines against the virus, the earliest expected vaccine is likely to be deployed at least 4-6 months

54     from now and is not expected to be readily available on a large scale [3, 4].


55     In addition to COVID-19, we are still exposed to other threatening pathogens. In countries with

56     temperate climates, seasonal influenza outbreaks mainly occur in the winter, with the first cases starting

57     to appear as early as September. This leads to recurrent widespread mortality and morbidity causing 3

58     to 5 million cases of severe illness and 290.000 to 650.000 deaths per year [5]. During the previous

59     2017/2018 flu season in Europe, an estimated excess mortality of 125.000 deaths was measured [6].

60     Because of the high morbidity and socioeconomic burden of recurrent influenza epidemics, vaccination

61     has become a key strategy in protecting high-risk individuals against the flu and is therefore a widely

62     promoted public health strategy [7-10]. Despite the wide use of flu vaccines, there is contradictory

63     information on how the influenza vaccine might affect the outcome of other infections, including COVID-

64     19. The potential interaction between vaccines and infections other than their target disease, has

65     attracted a great deal of attention lately. It has been demonstrated that certain vaccines (such as bacillus

66     Calmette-Guérin (BCG), measles-containing vaccines, or oral polio vaccine) have strong beneficial

67     protective effects through long-term boosting of innate immunity, a process called trained immunity [11].

68     In line with this, several recent studies suggested a potential beneficial effect of influenza vaccination

69     on susceptibility to COVID-19 [12, 13]. Despite earlier reports that have shown little or opposite effects

70     of influenza vaccines on heterologous infections in children [14-19]. With the flu season on its way and

71     influenza vaccination campaigns starting off soon, it is paramount to clarify the exact effects of influenza

72     vaccination on the incidence and the disease course of COVID-19.

 73     In this study, we investigated the possible induction of trained immunity responses by the influenza

74      vaccine used in the 2019-2020 winter season in the Netherlands. In addition, we assessed the

75      correlation between influenza vaccination, the incidence of COVID-19, and the disease outcome, using

76      the influenza vaccination rates in employees of the Radboud University Medical Center, one of the large

77      academic hospitals of the Netherlands.

 79     METHODS


 80     Blood donors


81      Buffy coats from healthy adult donors were obtained after written informed consent (Sanquin blood bank,

82      Nijmegen, The Netherlands). The study was approved by the Arnhem- Nijmegen Medical Ethical

83      Committee.


84


 85     In-vitro influenza training model


 86     Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using Ficoll-Paque (VWR, Tingalpa,

 87     Australia) density gradient isolation and resuspended in RPMI 1640+ (Dutch modified, ThermoFisher,

 88     Waltham, MA, USA) culture medium supplemented with 50 mg/mL gentamicin, 2 mM glutamax

 89     (ThermoFisher), and 1 mM pyruvate (ThermoFisher). PBMCs were diluted to a concentration of 5*106

 90     cells/ml and 100μl (500.000 cells) of cell suspension was added to each well of a 96-wells round bottom

 91     plate. PBMCs were stimulated with Vaxigrip Tetra® (Sanofi Pasteur Europe), which is similar to the

92      vaccine used in the 2019/2020 vaccination campaign in the Netherlands. The influenza vaccine contains

93      15 grams of Hemagglutinin each from 4 inactivated, non-adjuvanted virus strains (1 A/Guangdong-

94      Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like strain, (A/GuangdongMaonan/SWL1536/2019, CNIC-1909,

95      2    A/Hong       Kong/2671/2019         (H3N2)      –like    strain,    (A/Hong      Kong/2671/2019,          IVR-208),      3

96      B/Washington/02/2019 – like strain (B/Washington/02/2019, wild type), 4 B/Phuket/3073/2013-like strain

97      (B/Phuket/3073/2013, wild type). Vaxigrip Tetra® was added to the wells in 10, 50, 100 and 400-fold

98      dilutions in 1640 culture medium (RPMI medium; Invitrogen, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% human

 99     pooled serum. In addition, 5 μg/ml of BCG (Bacille Calmette- Guérin, SSI, Denmark) was added to half

100     of the wells to investigate the potency of influenza vaccine to enhance trained immunity induced by



                                                                                                                                      4

101     BCG. PBMCs were incubated for 24h after which the supernatants were harvested. Cells were washed

102     with warm PBS and medium was refreshed. PBMCs were then left to rest in culture medium for another

103     5 days, after which (on day 6) they were restimulated with LPS (10 ng/mL) or inactivated SARS-CoV-2

104     [20] (SARS-CoV-2 NRW-42 isolate, 40x diluted, TCID50/mL 6.67*104) for 24 hours. On day 7,

105     supernatants were harvested and stored at -20°C for cytokine measurements (Figure 1).


106


107     Lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH) assay


108     Cytotoxicity was measured using LDH concentrations in fresh supernatants collected after 24 h

109     stimulation, using the Cyto-Tox96 Non-Radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega, WI, USA).


110


111     Cytokine measurements


112     Cytokine concentrations were determined in 24 h supernatants (TNF- , IL-6, IL-1β) and 7 day

113     supernatants (TNF- , IL-6, IL-1RA, and IFN-γ) using commercial ELISA kits (R&D systems, Bio-

114     Techne, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.


115


116     Observational data healthcare workers


117     The Radboudumc hospital registration database of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive healthcare workers as

118     of June 1st 2020 was consulted. The corresponding influenza vaccination status of healthcare workers

119     was retrieved from the database of the Department of Occupational Health and Safety of the hospital,

120     as well as the total influenza vaccination coverage rate (VCR) of the Radboudumc during the flu season

121     of 2019/2020. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 positive employees were sent a questionnaire to assess

122     disease duration, severity and comorbidities. Disease duration was measured as the number of days

123     between the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and the first day employees resumed their work. All hospital

124     employees are equally offered an influenza vaccination every year. However, SARS-CoV-2 testing in

125     the beginning of the pandemic was only available for employees who were indispensable for patientcare,

126     due to shortage of testing materials. Giving the observational nature of this study and the use of short

127     questionnaires only, no ethical approval was required.

128


129     Data analysis


130     Hospital database analysis was done using IBM SPSS statistics 25. To assess the association between

131     COVID-19 incidence and influenza vaccination status, a Chi-square test was used. No correction for

132     confounding was possible because no individual characteristics were available in the SARS-CoV-2 PCR

133     negative health care workers; only influenza vaccination status data for the entire group was known.

134     Missing values of other variables were left out of analysis. Cytokine and LDH concentrations were

135     analyzed using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Absolute cytokine concentrations were

136     determined after 24 hours in influenza vaccine stimulated conditions (with and without BCG) and

137     compared with unstimulated conditions. As a readout for trained immunity responses, influenza vaccine-

138     primed (at day 6 LPS and SARS-CoV-2 restimulated) conditions were compared to RPMI conditions as

139     a negative control and BCG only conditions as a positive control. To assess synergistic effects on trained

140     immunity, combined influenza vaccine and BCG stimulated conditions were also compared. LDH values

141     were calculated to percentages of cell death, with lysed cells as a positive control. Data were analyzed

142     using Graphpad 8.02 (La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA). A two-sided P-value below .05 (*) or below .01

143     (**) was considered statistically significant. Data are shown as means ± SEM.


144


145     RESULTS


146     A quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Vaxigrip Tetra®) amplifies cytokine production in

147     human PBMCs


148     Freshly isolated PBMCs from healthy donors (n=9) were stimulated for 24 h with Vaxigrip Tetra® in 10,

149     50, 100, or 400 times dilutions alone or in presence of BCG. Stimulation with Vaxigrip Tetra® alone did

150     not result in increased production of IL-6, TNF- , or IL-1β by itself. However, the combination of the

151     influenza vaccine with BCG induced significantly higher cytokine production compared to BCG alone,

152     suggesting a synergistic effect between these two vaccines. This effect was dose-dependent, with

153     higher dilutions of the influenza vaccine associated with a higher cytokine production (Figure 2). To rule

154     out cell death as a cause of cytokine release, LDH concentrations were measured in fresh supernatants




                                                                                                                                      6

155     collected after 24 h stimulation and showed no differences between conditions (Supplementary Figure

156     1), arguing against toxic effects of the vaccines.


157


158     Vaxigrip Tetra® induces trained immunity and amplifies BCG-induced trained immunity


159     In a separate set of experiments, 6 days after an initial 24h period of training of human PBMCs with the

160     quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, the cells were restimulated with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-

161     2 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli for another 24h. Training with different

162     concentrations of the influenza vaccine induced the production of higher levels of IL-1RA after

163     restimulation with SARS-CoV-2 for all the dilutions tested, as well as for LPS (400x dilution) (figure 3A,

164     B). Combining the influenza vaccine with BCG abrogated this effect. Trained immunity responses on

165     the production of IL-6 were observed in almost all influenza vaccine-primed conditions after restimulation

166     with LPS (all dilutions) and heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (10x, 100x, 400x dilutions) (Figure 3C). In

167     addition, induction of trained immunity by BCG was amplified by training with the combination of BCG

168     and Vaxigrip Tetra® (Figure 3D). PBMC training with the influenza vaccine alone also enhanced IFN-γ

169     production stimulated with SARS-CoV-2, but not LPS (Figure 3E). The combination of BCG with Vaxigrip

170     Tetra® also induced higher responses upon restimulation with SARS-CoV-2, but not with LPS (Figure

171     3F). None of the influenza vaccine-primed conditions produced any significant release of TNF-α after

172     SARS-CoV-2 restimulation. Only in BCG-primed conditions after LPS restimulation a higher induction

173     of TNF-α was present (Figure 3G, H). Overall, training with various concentrations of the influenza

174     vaccine enhanced cytokine production upon restimulation, and also amplified the trained immunity

175     inducing capacity of BCG.


176


177     Quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccination is associated with lower COVID-19 incidence


178     As of June 1st 2020, at the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, Radboud

179     University Medical Center counted a total of 10.631 employees of which 184 were documented as

180     SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive according to the hospital’s database. The average age of the employees

181     was 41 years and 42 years in the SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative group, respectively. Female

182     employees made up a slightly higher proportion of the SARS-CoV-2 positive group (79%) compared to

183     the SARS-CoV-2 negative group (70%) (Table 1).


184     To investigate the effect of influenza vaccination on the incidence of COVID-19, we gathered the

185     influenza vaccination status of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive employees in the Radboud University Medical

186     Center and compared it to the influenza vaccination coverage rates in hospital employees unaffected

187     by COVID-19. Within the SARS-CoV-2 positive group, 42% (77/184) of the individuals were vaccinated

188     with influenza during the flu season of 2019/2020, whereas the total influenza vaccine coverage rate for

189     that season in SARS-CoV-2 negative personnel was 54% (5664/10447). This resulted in a 2.23%

190     incidence of COVID-19 in the non-vaccinated individuals, while the incidence of COVID-19 in influenza

191     vaccinated individuals was 1.33%: thus, a statistically significant negative association between influenza

192     vaccination and COVID-19 incidence of RR = 0,61 (95% CI, 0.46 - 0.82, P = 0.001) (Χ2(1, N = 10632) =

193     11,41, p = .0008) (Figure 4A, B) was identified. We found no association between influenza vaccination

194     status and COVID-19 duration: the mean disease duration in influenza-unvaccinated personnel was

195     17±9 days, and 18±11 days in vaccinated individuals (P = .23). It is important to note that 76% of SARS-

196     CoV-2 positive employees had direct patient contact, as opposed to 42% in SARS-CoV-2 negative

197     personnel.


198     Among SARS-CoV-2 positive employees, only one of the individuals was hospitalized, but did not need

199     any intensive-care treatment. No SARS-CoV-2 related deaths among positive employees occurred. The

200     mean ages were 39 and 44 years for influenza unvaccinated and vaccinated employees within the

201     SARS-CoV-2 positive group respectively. There were no significant differences between sex, patient

202     contact or comorbidities in both groups (Table 2).

204     DISCUSSION


205     In the present study, we demonstrate that the tetravalent inactivated influenza vaccine Vaxigrip Tetra®

206     induces trained immunity in an established in-vitro model, resulting in improved responsiveness of

207     immune cells to SARS-CoV-2 stimulation. In addition, Vaxigrip Tetra® amplifies the capacity of the BCG

208     vaccine to induce trained immunity [21]. These results are in line with a previous study from our group

209     in which 40 healthy volunteers received a trivalent influenza vaccine 14 days after receiving either BCG

210     or placebo [22]. Whilst BCG exhibited a broad increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines for a larger set of



                                                                                                                                      8

211     unrelated pathogens, the influenza vaccine showed more selective augmentation of cytokine responses

212     after ex-vivo restimulation of peripheral blood leukocytes, similar to our observations. In addition, we

213     complement these data with an epidemiological analysis that shows an inverse association between

214     influenza vaccination using a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, and COVID-19 incidence. This

215     suggests a protective effect of the flu vaccine against infection with SARS-CoV-2.


216


217     Our data are in line with several recent ecological studies (Table 3). Hernandez et al. employed publicly

218     available data from the 2019/2020 influenza vaccination season in Italy with a quadrivalent vaccine, a

219     trivalent inactivated vaccine, and an inactivated, adjuvanted trivalent vaccine to calculate a linear

220     regression model to predict the COVID-19 mortality in vaccinated adults over 65 years of age. They

221     found a moderate to strong negative correlation (r = −.5874, n = 21, P = .0051) between influenza

222     vaccination and mortality in the elderly, suggesting that if the influenza VCR was higher, less individuals

223     died from COVID‐19 [23]. Another Italian study used data from 21 Italian regions and also found a

224     negative correlation between influenza VCR and SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, hospitalization rates,

225     ICU admissions as well as COVID-19 related mortality in the elderly. Multivariable analysis revealed a

226     R2 of 0.88, 0.82, 0.70 and 0.78 for all the outcomes respectively. In other words, influenza vaccination

227     strongly predicts the variance in the aforementioned outcomes [13]. Zanettini et al. concluded that a

228     10% increase in VCR could decrease SARS-CoV-2 related mortality by 28 percent, adjusted for several

229     variables [24]. Arokiaraj also described the existence of negative correlations between VCR and COVID-

230     19 related morbidity and mortality in individuals over 65 years of age in members of the Organisation for

231     Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. However, these correlations were not

232     substantiated by statistical evidence, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions [25]. On the contrary,

233     Lisewski et al. found an increased COVID-19 risk in 28 OECD countries as a result of influenza

234     vaccination, assessed with a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.58 (95CI: 0.27 to 0.78; p=0.001),

235     between VCR and attack rates [26]. A recent report from the Evidence-based medicine, public health

236     and environmental toxicology consortium (EBMPHET), compared the vaccination coverage rate among

237     elderly (≥ 65 years of age) and COVID-19 infection risk and disease severity in Europe and the USA.

238     They found a statistically significant positive correlation between the VCR and reported COVID-19

239     incidence in Europe (r = 0.66 ± 0.13, P = .000017) as well as mortality for Europe (r = 0.68 ± 0.13, p =

240     0.000006) and the USA, but confounding factors were not taken into account [27].

242     Overall, the majority of the ecological data are leaning to a possible protective effect of the influenza

243     vaccines. However, ecological studies also have several limitations. In this respect, there can be

244     systematic differences in how countries and areas report disease, mortality and exposures. For

245     example, in Italy any deceased person with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test is registered as a SARS-CoV-

246     2 related death [28]. Besides this, information on confounding factors and effect modifiers can be

247     missing and correction for confounders sometimes is impossible, causing over- or underestimation of

248     outcomes. Wals et al. reviewed 18 studies in which influenza and its associations with other respiratory

249     infections as well as COVID-19 were assessed. The conclusion was that live influenza vaccines are

250     safe, however data on trivalent inactivated vaccines were not reassuring, followed by the suggestion to

251     vaccinate with live vaccines when possible [29]. Aside from ecological studies, there is a recent cross

252     sectional study conducted in Brazil, also supportive of a negative correlation between an inactivated

253     trivalent influenza and COVID-19 attributed mortality (17% lower odds, 95%CI [0.75,0.89]), need of

254     intensive care treatment (8% lower odds, 95%CI [0.86,0.99]) and need of invasive respiratory support

255     (18% lower odds, 95%CI [0.74,0.88]). Correction for comorbidities, several sociodemographic factors

256     and healthcare facilities was performed [30].


257


258     Many of these studies hypothesized that trained immunity may be the mechanism underlying these

259     observations [21, 31-33]. The most extensively studied vaccine that induces trained immunity is BCG,

260     which is currently being examined for its putative protective effects against COVID-19 duration and

261     severity in several clinical trials (NCT04328441, NCT04348370, NCT04327206, NL8609). Although this

262     property is usually assigned to live vaccines [34], whether influenza vaccination can also induce trained

263     immunity was not known. In this study we also found that Vaxigrip Tetra® induces a trained immunity

264     response towards both SARS-CoV-2 and the TLR4 ligand LPS, and in addition synergized with the

265     trained immunity effects of BCG. The fast induction of cytokine responses at the beginning of the

266     infection is crucial to decrease the viral load and prevent systemic inflammation. The amplified IL-6

267     response activates acute phase proteins, stimulates effector T-cell development along with antibody

268     secretion, forming the linkage between innate and adaptive immunity, thus contributing to the clearance

269     of the infection [35]. On the other hand, anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1Ra are necessary to




                                                                                                                                     10

270     fine-tune the inflammation and counteract excessive inflammation. In our experimental setup we

271     observed both, increased production of IL-6 paralleled with IL-1Ra, after stimulation with the influenza

272     vaccine and BCG. This confirms that these cytokines might contribute to keeping a balance in the

273     inflammatory status of the individual [36]. In addition, trained immunity is also known to be induced in

274     NK cells, which play an important role in containing viral infections, among others through their

275     production of IFN-γ. The increased IFN-γ produced after stimulation with the influenza vaccine and BCG,

276     as shown here, can indicate the long-term functional reprogramming of NK cells, which then activate

277     macrophages to further orchestrate the clearing of pathogens [37].


278


279     Our study also has important limitations. The database analysis performed in this study did not allow to

280     correct for confounders, as we were not able to access data of individual influenza vaccination status in

281     SARS-CoV-2 negative employees. An important confounder is the difference in the rate of the direct

282     contact with patients between employees who developed SARS-CoV-2 or not, since this was the

283     variable unevenly distributed among the two groups, with less direct patient contact in SARS-CoV-2

284     negative employees. However, earlier studies have reported that most of the SARS-CoV-2 infections in

285     hospital personnel occur in society, rather than through patient contact in the hospitals [38-40].

286     Furthermore, we had no information on comorbidities in SARS-CoV-2 negative personnel or other

287     exposures outside the hospital environment. Within the SARS-CoV-2 positive group, part of the

288     individuals did not return the questionnaire which included information about comorbidities. These

289     missing values were left out and could not be computed which can affect the analysis as well. Lastly,

290     one cannot rule out healthy-vaccinee bias, and caution is always required when translating survey data

291     into real-life conditions.


292


293     In conclusion, we provide observational data suggesting a potentially protective role of the quadrivalent

294     inactivated influenza vaccine on COVID-19 incidence. In addition, we report first insights in the

295     immunological mechanisms underlying these observations. We show that a quadrivalent inactivated

296     influenza vaccine can induce trained immunity, and the plausible mechanisms through which an

297     enhanced antiviral state is acquired after vaccination. Considering these data, and with at least several

298     months more needed until a specific SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is available, influenza vaccination may



                                                                                                                                     11

299     contribute not only to reduction of influenza but also to the COVID-19-related burden on the healthcare

300     system. While our data show that earlier influenza vaccination is safe in relation to a later SARS-CoV-2

301     infection, we recommend vaccination in the absence of active COVID-19, because of the theoretical

302     possibility to induce a cytokine storm by an enhanced immune response if the vaccine is given during

303     an active infection. Additionally, our data suggest that the presence of a previous BCG vaccination prior

304     to the influenza vaccination could lead to enhanced responses and improved protection, raising the

305     possibility to conduct clinical trials to asses this hypothesis.

            contained RPMI. After 24 h the supernatant was collected and cells were washed. Fresh RPMI was

            added to the cells and left to incubate for another 5 days. On day 6, the PBMCs were restimulated with

  Figure 3 - Inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine induces trained immunity after

  restimulation with SARS-CoV-2 and LPS and influences BCG-induced training. PBMCs were

  trained with several dilutions of the inactivated quadrivalent vaccine (10x, 50x, 100x, 400x) with or

  without BCG (5 μg/mL), restimulated at day 6 with LPS (10 ng/ml) or SARS-CoV-2 ((40x diluted,

  TCID50/mL 6.67*10e4) for 24 h and compared to RPMI conditions. Vaxigrip Tetra® amplified IL-1Ra

  (A, B) and IL-6 (C, D) responses after SARS-CoV-2 or LPS restimulation, compared to stimulation of

  naïve PBMCs. Training with BCG diminished the training effect of Vaxigrip Tetra® on IL-1Ra production,

  but increased IL-6 responses even more. A significant increase in IFN-γ production was seen after

  training of PBMCs with 10x dilutions of the influenza vaccine and restimulation with SARS-CoV-2. The

  combination of the influenza vaccine with BCG induced even more IFN-γ than BCG alone (E, F). No

  significant increase in TNF-α by Vaxigrip Tetra® was observed after restimulation with SARS-CoV-2

  (G). Vaxigrip Tetra® enhanced TNF production upon LPS restimulation, but only in combination with

  BCG (H). (Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test, n =7- 9, * = P < .05, ** = P <.01)
