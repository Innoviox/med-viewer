33     Objective: To identify potential serum biomarkers in women with peritoneal endometriosis (PE)
34     by first looking at its source in the peritoneal fluid (PF).
35     Design: Case-control pilot studies, comprising independent discovery and validation sets.
36     Setting: KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, Singapore.
37     Patient(s): Women with laparoscopically confirmed PE and absence of endometriosis (control).
38     Intervention(s): None.
39     Main Outcome Measure(s): In the discovery set, we used untargeted liquid chromatography-
40     mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics, multivariable and univariable analyses to
41     generate global metabolomic profiles of PF for endometriosis and to identify potential
42     metabolites that could distinguish PE (n=10) from controls (n=31). Using targeted
43     metabolomics, we validated the identified metabolites in PF and sera of cases (n=16 PE) and
44     controls (n=19). We performed the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve
45     (AUC) analysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance of PE metabolites.
46     Result(s): In the discovery set, PF phosphatidylcholine (34:3) and phenylalanyl-isoleucine were
47     significantly increased in PE than controls groups, with AUC 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.61-
48     0.92; p=0.018) and AUC 0.98 (0.95-1.02; p<0.001), respectively. In the validation set,
49     phenylalanyl-isoleucine retained discriminatory performance to distinguish PE from controls in
50     both PF (AUC 0.77; 0.61-0.92; p=0.006) and serum samples (AUC 0.81; 0.64-0.99; p=0.004).
51     Conclusion(s): Our preliminary results propose phenylalanyl-isoleucine as a potential
52     biomarker of PE, which may be used as a minimally-invasive diagnostic biomarker of PE.

54     INTRODUCTION
55     Endometriosis affects approximately 10% of reproductive aged women (1, 2) and is associated
56     with substantial morbidity, including chronic pelvic pain and infertility (3, 4). Endometriosis is
57     represented by three main subphenotypes: ovarian endometriosis (OE), superficial peritoneal
58     endometriosis (PE) and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) (5). To diagnose endometriosis,
59     transvaginal ultrasonography can be used to detect OE and DIE (6, 7), with pelvic magnetic
60     resonance imaging to assess the extent of DIE (1). However, the detection of PE, characterized
61     by superficial endometrial lesions occurring on the peritoneum, remains challenging (8-11).
62     Laparoscopic visualization remains as the standard for definitive diagnosis of PE, the most
63     common subphenotype which accounts for ~80% of all endometriosis (11-13).
64               Using laparoscopic visualization as the first line diagnostic tool poses a number of
65     challenges, including its invasive nature, associated risks and potential complications of surgery
66     (11). Laparoscopy is appropriate when symptoms reach a level of severity to justify the surgical
67     risk (5), yet clinical symptoms has a poor correlation with disease burden (10). Indeed, accuracy
68     of diagnosis is dependent on practitioners’ laparoscopic skills due to the diversity of
69     endometriotic appearances and locations, insofar that endometriosis may be inadvertently
70     missed with less obvious or microscopic endometriotic lesions (14). Consequently, there is often
71     a delay with an average of eight years in the diagnosis of endometriosis (6). Thus, there is a
72     great need to identify a less invasive method for PE diagnosis, which would have a
73     groundbreaking impact in preventing or delaying disease progression, improving patients’
74     quality of life and the efficacy of available treatments. This is particularly important in women for
75     whom fertility is a priority whereby hormonal treatment is not appropriate (13).
76               To date, despite the evaluation of numerous potential biomarkers, a reliable biomarker
77     specifically for the diagnosis of PE has yet to be identified (10). Advances of high-throughput
78     bioanalytical technologies in omics have made metabolomics a powerful tool for biomarker
79     discovery (15, 16). Metabolites are intermediates to a wide range of biological processes and
                                                                                                                                          4

 80     signaling axes such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), peroxisome proliferator-
 81     activated receptor (PPAR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (17-19). The
 82     association of aberrant metabolism and endometriosis has emerged in recent years (20-22).
 83     Differences in metabolism and metabolite levels reflecting endometriosis subphenotypes
 84     pathophysiology potentially forms the basis for identifying novel biomarkers for PE.
 85               The peritoneal fluid (PF) is notably rich in proteins and lipids including cytokines,
 86     chemokines, growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases, and serves an important
 87     environment where endometriotic lesions reside and communicate with surrounding tissues
 88     including nerve cells and ovaries (23-25). The PF is therefore a source for the assessment of
 89     the dysregulated peritoneal cavity, and for reflecting dysregulated metabolic state of the
 90     subphenotypes. Thus, in this study, we aimed to identify potential biomarkers for the diagnosis
 91     of peritoneal endometriosis by first looking at its source in the peritoneal fluid. Through
 92     untargeted metabolomics, we characterized global metabolomics alterations in the peritoneal
 93     fluid samples, and multivariable and univariable statistics were used to discover potential
 94     biomarkers that resolve women with a laparoscopic diagnosed peritoneal endometriosis and
 95     without endometriosis. To verify the identified potential biomarkers in peritoneal fluid, we
 96     performed targeted metabolomics on peritoneal fluid and serum samples of women from
 97     independent case-control sets.

 99     MATERIALS AND METHODS
100     Study design
101     In this case-control pilot study, investigation of biomarkers was conducted in two phases
102     (Supplemental Figure 1, available online). Phase I, defined as the discovery set, untargeted
103     metabolomics approach was employed to generate PF-specific global metabolomic maps of
104     endometriosis. Phase II, defined as the validation set, where two separate groups of women
105     were independently enrolled to verify the identified PF-metabolites for PE diagnosis. We
                                                                                                                                           5

106     performed targeted metabolomics analysis using both PF (invasive) and serum samples
107     (minimally-invasive) among women with PE and controls. This study was conducted according
108     to the Helsinki Declaration, and all procedures were approved by the Singhealth Centralized
109     Institutional Review Board (reference 2010-167-D).
110
111     Clinical participants
112     Patients were recruited from the subfertility clinic in the KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital,
113     Singapore, between June 2010 and May 2013 for Phase I, and between June 2010 and August
114     2016 for Phase II. Laparoscopy was scheduled for suspected endometriosis, infertility,
115     sterilization procedures, and/or pelvic pain. Exclusion criteria included menstruating patients,
116     post-menopausal patients, patients on hormonal therapy (e.g. norethisterone, combined oral
117     contraceptive pill) for at least three months before laparoscopy, and other potentially
118     confounding diseases such as diabetes, adenomyosis or any other chronic inflammatory
119     diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic sclerosis). All eligible
120     patients provided written informed consent upon recruitment.
121               During diagnostic laparoscopy, a detailed inspection of the uterus, fallopian tubes,
122     ovaries, pouch of Douglas and the pelvic peritoneum was performed by senior gynecologists
123     subspecialized in reproductive endocrinology and infertility. Patients with laparoscopically
124     confirmed PE were defined as the cases, and staged according to the revised American Fertility
125     Society classification of endometriosis (AFS, 1985; ASRM, 1997). The possible overlapping of
126     the three lesion subphenotypes led us to classify the patients according to the worst lesion
127     found in each subject, based on endometriosis subphenotype grouping by Somigliana et al. (26)
128     and Chapron et al. (27). Patients from the same clinic but laparoscopically observed to be
129     without endometriosis were defined as the controls, including those with benign gynecological
130     presentations such as tubal occlusion, uterine fibroids, benign ovarian cysts and polycystic
131     ovary.
                                                                                                                                           6

133     Sample collection and sample processing
134     For the collection of PF, clinical staff collected samples via aspiration with a syringe attached to
135     an irrigation/suction tube from the Pouch of Douglas, with 1% protease inhibitor added (Roche,
136     Switzerland) as previously described (28), and which is in line with Endometriosis Phenome and
137     Biobanking Harmonization Project Standard Operating Procedures (29). The aspirates were
138     then centrifuged (1,000×g, 4°C) for 10 min and the clear supernatants were transferred to 15 mL
139     tubes. For the collection of peripheral venous blood, samples were collected into the BD
140     Vacutainer® SST II tubes. After 10 min centrifugation (1,200×g, 4°C), the top yellowish layers
141     were transferred to 15 mL tubes, followed by centrifuging for another 10 min (3,600×g, 4°C)
142     where the supernatants were transferred to 1 ml aliquots. Both PF and serum samples were
143     stored at -80°C until further use (28).
144               Prior to LC-M/S analysis, 100 μL from PF or serum sample was thawed at 4°C and
145     proteins were precipitated with 400 μL ice-cold methanol. After vortexing for 1 min, the mixture
146     was centrifuged at 17,000×g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected and
147     evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator. The dry extracts were then resuspended in
148     100 μL of 98:2 water/methanol or in 100 µL of 0.1% formic acid in methanol for untargeted or
149     targeted metabolomics, respectively. Quality control (QC) samples were prepared by mixing
150     equal amounts of reconstituted extracts from all the samples and processed as per other
151     samples. All samples were kept at 4°C and analyzed in a random manner. QC samples are
152     interspersed through the analytical runs and ran after each 10th sample to monitor the stability of
153     the system.

156     We performed metabolomics analysis as previously described with modifications (30).
157     Reversed-phase liquid chromatography-MS analyses were performed using the Agilent 1290
158     ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography system (Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a 6520
159     Q-TOF mass detector managed by a MassHunter workstation. The column used for the
160     separation was rapid resolution HT Zorbax SB-C18 (2.1×100 mm, 1.8 μm; Agilent Technologies,
161     USA), and the mobile phase was (A) 0.1% formic acid in water and (B) 0.1% formic acid in
162     methanol. The initial condition of the gradient elution was set at 2% B for 2 min with a flow rate
163     of 0.4 ml/min. A 7 min linear gradient to 70% B was then applied, followed by a 5 min gradient to
164     100% B which was held for 3 min. The sample injection volume was 2 μL and the oven
165     temperature was set at 40°C. The electrospray ionization mass spectra were acquired in both
166     positive and negative ion mode. Mass data were collected between m/z 100 and 1000 at a rate
167     of two scans per second. The ion spray voltage was set at 4,000 V for positive mode and 3,500
168     V for negative mode. The heated capillary temperature was maintained at 350°C. The drying
169     gas and nebulizer nitrogen gas flow rates were 12.0 L/min and 50 psi, respectively. Two
170     reference masses were continuously infused to the system to allow constant mass correction
171     during the run: m/z 121.0509 (C5H4N4) and m/z 922.0098 (C18H18O6N3P3F24).
172
173     Targeted mass spectrometry analysis
174     The targeted LC-MS/MS analysis was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mode via Triple
175     Quadrupole 6460 mass spectrometer with Jet Stream (Agilent Technologies). Chromatographic
176     separation was achieved by using Eclipse Plus column C18 (2.1×50 mm; Agilent, US) with
177     mobile phases (A) 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid in water and (B) 0.1%
178     formic acid in methanol. The initial condition was set at 100% A for 3 min at a flow rate of
179     0.3ml/min. A 3 min linear gradient to 100% B was then applied and held for 3 min. Then the
180     gradient returned to starting conditions over 0.1 min and maintain at the initial condition for 3
181     min. The column was kept at 45°C and the flow rate was 0.3 mL/min. The auto-sampler was
                                                                                                                                           8

182     cooled at 4°C and an injection volume of 2 μL was applied. Mass transition and collision energy
183     were optimized for each compound by direct infusion of individual standard solutions. Both
184     positive and negative electrospray ionization modes were performed with the following source
185     parameters: drying gas temperature at 250°C with a flow of 5 L/min, nebulizer gas pressure at
186     40 psi, sheath gas temperature at 400°C with a flow of 11 L/min, capillary voltage 4,000 and
187     3,500 V for positive and negative mode respectively, and nozzle voltage 500 V for both positive
188     and negative modes. Data acquisition and processing were performed using MassHunter
189     software (Agilent Technologies, US).
190
191     Data analysis and Compound identification
192     For metabolomics analysis, raw spectrometric data were converted to mzData (LC-MS/MS) and
193     NetCDF (GC-MS) formats via Masshunter (Agilent, US) and input to open-source software
194     MZmine 2.0 for peak finding, peak alignment and peak normalization across all samples. The
195     structure identification of the differential metabolites was based on a previously described
196     strategy (31). First, the element composition C13H25NO4 of the m/z 260.18 ion was calculated

198     from Agilent. Then, the elemental composition and exact mass were used for open source
199     database searching, including LIPIDMAPS (http://www.lipidmaps.org/), HMDB

208     U-test and Fisher’s exact test were used to compare continuous and categorical subject
209     characteristics respectively between PE versus controls. Significantly different metabolites
210     (SDMs) were defined by a fold change of >1.50 for increased metabolites and <0.67 for
211     decreased metabolites. We performed the area under the receiver-operating characteristics
212     (ROC) curve (AUC) analysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance of PE metabolites.
213     AUC>0.70 was defined as optimal diagnostic performance value. Sensitivity and specificity were
214     determined at maximum Youden Index. For the discovery datasets, a two-sided p<0.05 was
215     considered statistical significance. For the validation datasets, a two-sided p<0.025 (0.05/2
216     outcomes) to account for multiplicity was considered statistically significant.

218     RESULTS
219     Characteristics of participants
220     For the discovery set, PF samples were analyzed for 10 women with PE (mean age 33.3 years
221     old) and 31 women who served as controls (mean age 33.9 years old). Majority of women with
222     PE were at minimal-mild stage of endometriosis (rAFS stage I-II). No differences were observed
223     in terms of age, ethnicity and cycle phase between women with PE and controls (Supplemental
224     Table 1, available online).
225               For the validation set, women with PE and controls were compared and analyzed. These
226     included PF samples for 19 PE (mean age 34.0 years old) and 20 controls (mean age 35.9
227     years old). Serum samples were available for 16 PE and 19 controls, as illustrated in
228     Supplemental Figure 1 (available online). Similar to the discovery set, majority of women with
229     PE (89.5%) were at minimal-mild stage of endometriosis. No differences in age, ethnicity and
230     cycle phase were shown between women with PE and controls.

233     Multivariable partial least squares regression (PLSR) model was constructed to reveal the PF
234     metabolome differences between women with PE and controls from the discovery set (Phase I).
235     The PLSR score plots unbiasedly yielded good separation between metabolomic profiles of
236     women with PE and controls (Figure 1A). Next, we projected the metabolomic profiles on the
237     endometriosis subphenotypes to identify metabolites that drive the subphenotype separation.
238     The PLSR loadings plot yielded biochemically diverse metabolites for the separation of women
239     with PE and controls. This discrimination was primarily driven by the top 20 metabolites shown
240     in Figure 1B. These metabolites comprised of 7 phospholipids, 5 free fatty acids, 4 amino acids,
241     1 carnitine, 1 sphingolipid, 1 dipeptide and 1 tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate. The list of PF
242     metabolites for PE and controls are shown in Supplemental Table 2 (available online). To
243     further ascertain the relationship of key metabolites to the subphenotypes, fold change was
244     applied to determine metabolites that are significantly different in PE compared with controls.
245
246     Discovery of PF metabolites that distinguished PE from controls
247     Using volcano plots, 13 PF metabolites showed significant fold change differences (p<0.05)
248     when compared PE with controls. Of these 13 metabolites, five were identified as SDMs with
249     fold change >1.50 or <0.67. Compared with the controls, women with PE exhibited higher levels
250     of 5-tetradecenoylcarnitine (2.33-fold), phosphatidylcholine C34:3 (1.66-fold), phenylalanyl-
251     isoleucine (1.79-fold) and tetracosahexaenoic acid (1.72-fold), but lower level of ceramide d34:0
252     (0.44-fold) (Figure 2). When diagnostic performance was evaluated by ROC analysis,
253     phenylalanyl-isoleucine and phosphatidylcholine C34:3 demonstrated diagnostic potential in
254     distinguishing women with PE from controls, as indicated by AUC 0.98 (95% confidence interval
255     (CI) 0.95-1.02; p<0.001; sensitivity 100%; specificity 95.8%) and by AUC 0.77 (95% CI 0.61-
256     0.92; p=0.018; sensitivity 77.8%; specificity 71.4%), respectively (Figure 3).

259     In Phase II, to more precisely quantify the relationship of the candidate biomarkers in PE
260     relative to controls, we next developed a targeted metabolomics assay to validate biomarker
261     candidates phenylalanyl-isoleucine and phosphatidylcholine C34:3. Analyzing the PF samples
262     from an independent set of women using our developed targeted metabolomics assay,
263     phenylalanyl-isoleucine retained its diagnostic potential in distinguishing PE from controls (AUC
264     0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.92; p=0.006; sensitivity 73.7%; specificity 72.2%) (Figure 4A). By contrast,
265     phosphatidylcholine C34:3 did not hold up to its initial diagnostic value (AUC 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-
266     0.83; p=0.121) and hence not considered for further analysis. Next, we investigated the utility of
267     phenylalanyl-isoleucine as a minimally-invasive biomarkers using serum samples. We found
268     that circulating phenylalanyl-isoleucine consistently distinguished PE from controls with AUC
269     0.81 (95% CI 0.64-0.99; p=0.004; sensitivity 71.4%; specificity 100%) (Figure 4B).
270
271     DISCUSSION
272     In this pilot study, we identified PF metabolites that differentiated women with PE from controls.
273     Using untargeted metabolomic LC-MS/MS that characterized the global metabolomic alterations
274     in the PF, a diverse PF metabolomes was shown in these women. The PF metabolomic profiles
275     pertaining to the PE subphenotype were then linked the pathophysiological changes to the
276     serum for biomarker discovery using a combination of untargeted and targeted metabolomics.
277     We provided evidence showing a novel PF metabolite, phenylalanyl-isoleucine, has the
278     potential as a biomarker of PE and was subsequently validated. Importantly, this metabolite was
279     reflected in circulation, with a diagnostic performance value of 81.4% in serum (sensitivity
280     71.4%; specificity 100%), suggesting its potential use as a minimally-invasive diagnostic
281     biomarker of PE.
282               PF is proximal to endometriotic lesions and thus, forms an environment that reciprocally
283     communicates with the lesions (32, 33). This indicates that PF can be a potential useful source
284     for biomarker discovery of PE. Intriguingly, the diagnostic characteristics of PF biomarkers for
                                                                                                                                         12

285     PE using metabolomics approach have not been assessed. Majority of earlier studies have
286     focused on identifying potential biomarkers of endometriosis in general without subphenotypes
287     specificity (21, 28, 34-37), with few focused on OE (22, 38, 39) but limited on PE (40).
288     Importantly, validation of proposed biomarkers which is critical to demonstrate biomarker
289     robustness has been rarely conducted (41). In biomarker discovery studies, differential levels of
290     metabolites such as cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), carnitines, phosphatidylcholine and
291     sphingomyelin in PF were observed in women with endometriosis (28, 38, 42), but there is
292     seldom linkage of these biomarkers to the circulating levels. CA-125 is a commonly investigated
293     biomarker for endometriosis despite its undefined role in primary diagnosis (3, 10). As
294     suggested, we performed additional analysis for CA-125 in serum of women from the validation
295     set and compared with its performance with serum phenylalanyl-isoleucine. Serum CA-125
296     showed poor diagnostic performance (AUC 0.66; 95% CI 0.47-0.84; p=0.120) in differentiating
297     PE (n=19) from controls (n=16) (Supplemental Figure 2, available online). Our findings are
298     consistent with international guidelines, such as the National Institute for Health and Care
299     Excellence (NICE) and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology
300     (ESHRE), which have made recommendations to not use serum CA-125 as biomarker for
301     endometriosis diagnosis due to its limited diagnostic performance (13, 43).
302               Our results demonstrate that phenylalanyl-isoleucine was increased in PF and serum of
303     PE women, with a high discriminatory ability to distinguish between women with PE and other
304     gynecological disorders requiring laparoscopic diagnosis (controls). Thus, data obtained from
305     this study have connected pathophysiology in the dysregulated peritoneal cavity to the
306     circulation in endometriosis, in line with reports showing correlations between biomarkers in PF
307     and serum (44, 45). Phenylalanyl-isoleucine (C15H22N2O3) is a dipeptide composed of
308     phenylalanine and isoleucine (46), which has been shown to play an essential role in
309     intracellular signal transduction (47). However, its functional role in endometriosis
310     pathophysiology remains unclear. To the best of our knowledge, phenylalanyl-isoleucine is a
                                                                                                                                         13

311     novel metabolite which has not been reported for endometriosis. Increased phenylalanyl-
312     isoleucine in PF might indicate an altered metabolic state that would potentially contribute to
313     further growth and development of peritoneal lesions (48). Compared to healthy controls,
314     women with early stage of endometriosis had previously found to exhibit decreased
315     phenylalanine and isoleucine in endometrial tissue and serum, respectively (20, 37). In contrast,
316     phenylalanyl-isoleucine appeared to be relatively abundant in PF of women with PE, which
317     could be explained by the proximity of PF with endometriotic lesions implanted in the peritoneal
318     cavity. It is possible that increased phenylalanyl-isoleucine reflected shedding into the PF due to
319     high levels of cell division, cell death and protein degradation. This is supported by Li et al. (49)
320     which found upregulations of various amino acids in the eutopic endometrium of women with
321     early endometriosis. Further research is required to elucidate the association of phenylalanyl-
322     isoleucine with PE pathophysiology.
323               Several studies have classified women with endometriosis according to their disease
324     stage, where greater altered metabolomic profiles and metabolite levels were seen in women
325     with later stages (III-IV) of endometriosis as compared with the controls (44, 45). Importantly,
326     differences in the levels and types of metabolites were also shown for women with stage I and II
327     endometriosis in relation to the controls (37, 49), indicating their potential for early disease
328     diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, PE cases were mostly classified at minimal-mild stages
329     (stage I-II), suggesting the candidate metabolite in women with PE might be additionally useful
330     to reflect the early stage of the disease.
331               Strengths of this study included quantitative and structured methodological framework to
332     identify the potential biomarker of PE, with the applications of untargeted, unbiased
333     metabolomics in the discovery process and targeted metabolomics with exquisite assay
334     sensitivity and precision in the validation process. Importantly, this study captured the most
335     comprehensive catalogued metabolome space of PF in women with laparoscopic diagnosed PE
336     to-date. By treating the identification of PF biomarker as a pre-selection procedure for
                                                                                                                                         14

337     subsequent study for serum marker, we successfully demonstrated the presence of candidate
338     biomarker in sera of PE women from an independent group, with optimal diagnostic
339     performance for PE. The procedure of validating biomarker using separate, independent sets of
340     samples by applying same analytical approach has rarely been carried out in most previous
341     studies. However, an important limitation of this study was the small sample size. This has
342     restricted our capability to stratify women with PE into individual stage of disease for further
343     assessing the prognostic applications of phenylalanyl-isoleucine. However, preliminary findings
344     generated from this pilot study serves as important baseline supportive evidence for conducting
345     subsequent larger scale studies to confirm the reliability and validity of phenylalanyl-isoleucine
346     for PE diagnosis.
347
348     CONCLUSIONS
349     In conclusion, we have identified a signature metabolite known as phenylalanyl-isoleucine in PF
350     of women with PE through untargeted and targeted metabolomics in independent datasets,
351     suggesting its involvement in the pathophysiology of PE. The same metabolite was identified in
352     the sera of women with PE. Large scale metabolomics studies validating this biomarker across
353     different populations will further determine its diagnostic robustness. More studies are also
354     warranted to test for the robustness of this biomarker in distinguishing PE from other
355     subphenotypes of endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory diseases that exhibit similar clinical
356     symptoms.
