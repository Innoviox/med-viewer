          population testing and enable the track and trace objectives set by governments and
          curtail the effects of a second surge in COVID-19 positive cases. In contrast to current
          PCR testing, using this technique there is no requirement of specific reagents which
          can cause devastating delays upon breakdowns of supply chains, thus providing a
          promising alternative testing method.
          Mass testing combined with effective, intensive contact tracing is essential if the global
          severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is to be
          controlled prior to the delivery of a vaccine.1–3 Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
          reaction (RT-PCR) testing for COVID19 is currently the gold standard diagnostic test; it
          extracts viral RNA from a nasopharyngeal swab, which is then amplified and measured by
          detection of a fluorescent tag. However, this analysis is slow (2 to >12 hours), costly and it
          has an inadequate sensitivity. Many governments failed to stock pile reagents prior to the
          pandemic, and those countries with centralised testing facilities have been unable to meet
          demand.4 In response to the pandemic, multiple diagnostic variations of Nulceic Acid Tests
          (NAT) methodologies have been rapidly developed as have protein tests based on the
          analysis of immunoglobulins or viral antigens.5 However, many of these suffer from similar
          challenges and RT-PCR and they have yet to be deployed at a population level. The United
          Kingdom’s government has therefore announced a testing Moon Shot programme to meet
          the mass testing challenge for COVID19.6
          Mass spectrometry (MS) represents a scalable and viable alternative to RT-PCR and
          antigen analysis for mass testing. Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation (MALDI) has
          completely revolutionised clinical microbiology7 and it has shown high diagnostic accuracy
          from nasal swabs when analysed using support vector machine learning algorithms.8
          Metabolomics approaches using UPLC-MS to analyse sera have identified 204 metabolites
          which correlate to disease severity in COVID-19 patients.9 In fact, several MS based
          methodologies have been recently described which suggest that both metabonomic and

          proteomics have significant diagnostic applications.10–12 A global MS coalition has now been
          established to accelerate the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.13
          One obstacle to the translation of MS based in vitro diagnostics is the time taken for sample
          preparation. Ambient mass spectrometry techniques such as Desorption Electrospray
          Ionisation (DESI) and Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (REIMS) directly
          analyse samples (Figure 1). Desorption electrospray ionisation (DESI) utilises an
          electrospray emitter to create gas phase ions, ionic clusters and charged microdroplets
          which are directed at a candidate sample.14 Rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry
          (REIMS) generates aerosolised droplets from the evaporation of sample by either Joule
          heating or laser irradiation.15 These two methods of mass spectrometry enable collection of
          m/z data representative of the surface of the biological sample in seconds. The speed,
          specificity and adaptability of these techniques enables potential for a fast and reliable point
          of care test for COVID-19. Another advantage of this technique is that the samples can be
          analysed directly from the dry swab, meaning that there is little to no sample preparation and
          risk of infection from sample preparation to the analysts.
          These are mature technologies which have been widely deployed in multiple clinical
          domains such as surgery for real time tissue diagnostics16–18 and in microbiology19. This
          technology therefore has the potential to be implemented at the point of care or it could be
          leveraged for mass testing of COVID-19. In this clinical pilot study, the diagnostic accuracy
          of ambient mass spectrometry platforms were prospectively assessed for COVID-19 using
          nasopharyngeal swabs as a sampling methodology.

          45 patients were prospectively recruited (median age 65 (25-87), 27 males and 18 females)
          (Table 1) as part of a feasibility study across Imperial College Healthcare Trust hospital sites
          in London between April 2020 and June 2020. The cohort contained 10 patients with active
          COVID-19 and a positive RT-PCR and 35 patients who were negative for COVID-19 on RT-
          PCR. Patients who had previously had a possible exposure to COVID-19 were included in
          this analysis, and of the 35 control patients, 21 had previously demonstrated a positive RT-
          PCR result, but none of these were within 7 days of the negative classification test used to
          build the diagnostic MS models. 4 patients in the control cohort had an active cough and 4
          were experiencing shortness of breath. In the COVID-19 cohort, all subjects were in patients
          at the time of sampling, but none were ventilated or receiving ventilatory support.
          RT-PCR was chosen as the gold standard method for distinguishing positive patients with
          active COVID19 from negative patients20 and it is part of routine clinical care carried out
          within Imperial College Healthcare Trusts. Patients who tested negative were followed up to
          observe if they developed COVID-19. One patient within the negative control cohort tested
          positive for COVID-19 within a week from the test swab. Patients underwent imaging at the
          discretion of the clinical team, and the radiological findings were compared to their
          corresponding PCR findings (Table 1). It was observed that 30% of those patients who
          yielded negative PCR and who underwent radiological investigation displayed positive
          radiological results suggestive of COVID-19.
          It was hypothesised that dry nasal swabs would contain biological information on the
          inflammatory status of the respiratory tract of the host along with any viral or bacterial
          species present.
          Ambient Ionisation Mass Spectrometry Analysis
          Due to precautions of transmission in the laboratory for the machine operators, swab
          samples were deactivated prior to analysis due to possible aerosolization of the virus in the
          analysis by ambient MS techniques. Deactivation is achieved by oven heating at 60˚C for 30

          mins.22 Figure 2 displays the effect of deactivation of the swabs on sample quality. From the
          spectra displayed, an increase in the ratio of biological material (in the region m/z 600-1000)
          to swab peaks is observed upon deactivation, possibly due to the swab being dried upon
          deactivation and therefore lower water content of the biological material being bombarded
          with the sprayer. It is important to note that the most abundant peaks in the spectra remain
          the same before and after deactivation and that there is no observable loss of abundant
          biological peaks. This experiment was achieved by the operator using their own swabs in an
          otherwise empty lab so therefore not contaminating anyone else with aerosolised particles
          from insufficiently deactivated samples.
          Once deactivated swab samples were analysed in sequence by DESI and LD-REIMS
          (Figure 3) so that a precise analysis of diagnostic accuracy could be performed. LD-REIMS
          is by its nature destructive, and therefore samples were first analysed by DESI. All samples
          were processed and analysed immediately after collection in order to keep the workflow as
          similar as possible to the point of care instrumentation that this work is demonstrating proof
          of concept for.
          DESI was run directly on the deactivated dry swabs without any need for extraction or
          preparation. The data acquisition files were collected at 1 scan per second and collected in
          seconds, depending on operator and the quality of biological sample on the swabs.
          DESI data was extracted using Waters Corporation software AMX and lockmass corrected
          to an internal peak of PI(38:4) which was present in all samples in high abundance. Total ion
          content was normalised, and the data was binned to m/z 0.1. Features were then selected
          using linear support vector classification (SVC) – resulting in 58 features, which were used
          for classification and cross validation. The features that contributed to this peak list are
          summarised in Supplementary Data Table 1. Figure 4 displays box plots of some of the
          DESI spectral features that drive classification between the positive or negative diagnosis
          classifications.

          DESI analysis showed high diagnostic accuracy when using the peak list of 58 features to
          classify patients using the SVC to classify patients. Using this supervised data analysis
          technique 39 patient samples were classified correctly out of 45 patients (Table 3,
          Supplementary Information). This gives a diagnostic accuracy of 86.7% which was
          calculated from leave one patient out cross validation. Given the sample cohort is small, this
          diagnostic accuracy was deemed to be acceptable and the model is expected to achieve
          higher diagnostic accuracy with increased number of samples. Tentative identification of the
          features in the peak list driving classification were performed by looking at the original
          lockmass corrected mass spectra to identify the accurate mass of the peak within the mass
          bin. This mass was then used to match to known species in databases such as lipidmaps
          and METLIN (Table 1, Supplementary information).
          LD-REIMS was also used to classify a smaller cohort of samples; a smaller set of samples
          were used herein due to the availability of samples after COVID-19 risk assessments were
          completed and laser safety was allowed with reduced capacity of workers in laboratories.
          The data was treated in the same way as the DESI data, but the lockmass used was the
          internal lipid of palmitic acid. This is due to the different methods of excitation and ionisation
          of liberated ions between DESI and LD-REIMS, there is a different spectral pattern between
          the two techniques and hence the most abundant peaks between the two different
          techniques differ significantly, therefore different lockmass peaks were selected for the two
          different ambient mass spectrometry techniques. Due to the smaller cohort of samples
          subjected to this analysis, the peak list extracted from the support vector machine learning
          algorithm totalled 15 peaks.
          LD-REIMS also showed high diagnostic accuracy supervised support vector machine
          learning classification. The technique correctly classified 21 out of 25 total patients, which
          results in a diagnostic accuracy of 84%. As with the DESI data, patient’s disease status is
          correlated to the patients most recent PCR test result. Figure 4 displays the unsupervised
          principle component analysis (PCA) along with the loadings plots from PC1, PC2 and PC3.
          DESI and LD-REIMS displayed similar variance in the data in PC1 of 37.86% and 34.01%

          respectively. PCA clustering was used to reduce the dimensions in the dataset for higher
          quality supervised classification techniques which calculate the relationship between the
          variables and separate based on factors that drive classification between classes.
          Spectral Content
          Both DESI and LD-REIMS display different spectral patterns which can be observed in
          Figure 6. This is due to the differing mechanisms of aerosol formation and ionisation in the
          two different techniques (Figure 1). In DESI analysis, an electrospray emitter is used to
          produce gas phase solvent ions, ionic clusters and charged microdroplets.14 An electric
          potential is applied to the solvent in the electrospray emitter and this imparts charge on the
          surface molecules in the path of the solvent projectile. If the surface group is given enough
          momentum it will leave the surface, be transported through the air at atmospheric pressure
          and reach the atmospheric interface of the mass spectrometer. Unlike usual DESI
          applications in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) where a very fine sprayer is required for
          better resolution, herein settings were optimised to spray a large surface area very quickly.
          LD-REIMS uses a Q-switched Optical Parametric Oscillator laser emitting at 2940nm which
          rapidly heats the water within biological samples causing cells to explode, forming gas phase
          clusters of ions and droplets containing structural lipid information and metabolites specific to
          the biological matrix. These aspirated metabolites are then transferred to the interface of the
          mass spectrometer where they are mixed with a matrix solvent, herein 2-isopropanol was
          used. The droplets which are absorbed into the matrix are then carried at high speed into the
          vacuum of the MS and encounter a heated collision surface maintained at 1200 K. Upon
          collision on the heated surface the droplets rapidly evaporate, and the ions are de-clustered
          allowing measurement of single ions.23
          Due to the nature of mass spectrometry profiling, contrary to other methods such as optical
          spectroscopy, the peaks observed are due to individual masses of particular lipids.
          Therefore, the mass spectroscopy profile can be used as a fingerprint of disease status and
          has biological meaning. The increase or decrease of abundance of these lipids can be used

          to explain some of the biological pathways associated with disease status and the
          observations made in this analysis.
          This analysis identified a decrease in abundance of free fatty acids and Phosphatidylinositol
          (PI) lipid species measured from swabs with positive COVID-19 status. This is in common
          with findings from other metabolomic studies focusing in COVID-19 disease states which
          saw general decreases in phospholipid and free fatty acid abundance in COVID-19 positive
          cases in blood plasma.9 Phospholipase enzymes, which cleave phospholipids into
          lysophospholipids and free fatty acids, have been linked to COVID-19 viral replication
          efficiency and immune response.24 These phospholipases are linked to strong immune
          response due to their role in production of eicosanoids from free fatty acids, in particular
          arachidonic acid (20:4) and hence this observation would be expected for infected patients.
          Platelet degranulation pathways associated with inflammation also cause significant
          changes in lipid abundance; and could be one of the major biochemical factors in the
          observed lipid species specific to COVID-19 diagnosis by ambient mass spectrometry
          techniques. The levels of phosphatylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) have
          been shown to be distributed asymmetrically in platelet bilayers. Activated externalisation of
          PE and PS phospholipids in platelet micro vesicles (MV) could also be the reason for their
          increased exposure in positive COVID-19 nasal fluid swabs.25 The increased abundance of
          these phospholipids in patients with positive COVID-19 diagnosis could be due to the
          formation of MV for viral replication in the cells. Increased coagulation is a common clinical
          observation in patients with COVID-19 and the relationship between platelet formation in the
          inflammatory response and the observed lipidomic species could be driving classification
          herein.26 Most omics studies performed so far on COVID-19 infected fluids have been
          focused on blood plasma samples9,27 and using different ionisation techniques which makes
          comparison difficult.
          Limitations

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.20207647.this version posted October 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

          One of the major limitations of this study is the sample size, and hence, further work will look
          to significantly enlarge the sample cohort of patients for analysis and clinical validation of this
          study. Another limitation of developing COVID-19 omics-based diagnostics tools in general,
          is the lack of robust gold standard tests herein for training datasets in machine learning.
          PCR is used in this study, but the accuracy of this test is problematic; in this study alone 7
          out of 35 patients that tested negative for COVID-19 displayed radiological results consistent
          with COVID-19 infection. However, 6 out of 7 of these patients had been previously exposed
          to COVID-19 testing positive >7 days previously. This suggests that radiology results display
          changes in the lung caused by COVID-19 but is not reflective of the patient’s current viral
          load. Whilst this study displays a variety of severity in the patients that tested positive for
          COVID-19, there was no study on the viral load and its effects on this model.
          Furthermore, this study has only addressed the effect of COVID-19 pathological status in
          clinical detection. In a larger dataset, further work will look to analyse the effect of
          confounding pathologies such as common colds or flu on the COVID-19 metabolomics
          approach used herein.
          Another factor to be considered is the aerosol generation produced by this analysis
          technique. Due to the nature of the aspiration in both DESI and LD-REIMS, 95% of the
          aspirated aerosol generated described in this work is organic solvent and should therefore
          deactivate any live virus as part of the normal workflow. As an extra precaution herein, all
          samples were deactivated before analysis. Future work encompasses the development of an
          air-tight chamber which encloses the swab and virus particles within it for analysis. Further
          work will also test the use of solvents such as IPA or methanol to immerse the swab before
          analysis. This mirrors the LD-REIMS workflow, but further validation for DESI techniques will
          establish if these alternative and faster deactivation methods are feasible. This will remove
          the need for deactivation and enable high-throughput analysis in a matter of seconds per
          sample.
          Conclusion

          The ambient ionisation mass spectrometry techniques demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy
          of 86.7% and 84% for DESI and LD-REIMS respectively which is expected to increase with a
          larger cohort of samples. DESI and LD-REIMS are therefore promising tools for the rapid
          diagnosis of COVID-19 infection status. The sampling method can be achieved in seconds
          without the need for sample preparation, which when compared to gold standard PCR
          testing, cuts analysis time significantly. One other advantage of this technique is that once
          geometry of the DESI sprayer is optimised and set up, then the samples can be collected
          and run by point of need staff with minimal training and future iterations of the instrument are
          expected to run completely automated. This technology provides a revolutionary approach to
          traditional microbiology testing which is easily scaled to deal with mass population testing
          required for control of the coronavirus pandemic. The implementation of this technology
          removes the risk of supply chain shortages causing delays because it does not rely on
          specific reagents and primers providing a promising alternative test to the traditional PCR
          approach.
          Methods
          Recruitment of patients
          Participants were prospectively recruited to this feasibility study within a sub-collection of
          Imperial College Tissue Bank, which acts under the HTA license 12275 and research ethics
          committee approval 17/WA/0161. Patients or staff at three London hospitals within Imperial
          College NHS Healthcare Trust between 29th April and 30th June 2020 were eligible for
          inclusion if they were aged 18 or over; displayed symptoms of COVID-19 (a new continuous
          cough, shortness of breath, temperature above 37.8 C and anosmia); required admission to
          the trust for emergency surgery or healthcare staff exposed to COVID-19. All participants
          gave written and informed consent for inclusion in the study. Participants included in the
          study were pseudonymized into a CVS number and each swab was given a CS number;
          most patients provided two swab samples. Clinical meta-data collected included

          demographics, presence of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and date of all PCR tests
          with the corresponding result.
          Sampling of Patients
          Deep nasal secretion samples were collected from both nostrils, using a woven polyester
          swab (harmony P3685), by appropriately trained clinical research personnel wearing PPE in
          accordance with local procedures. Patients with nasal obstruction due to medical devices
          such as nasogastric tubes, or to pre-existing distorted anatomy, had samples collected from
          the unobstructed nostril only. The swab was gently inserted to the mid turbinate level and
          allowed to rest for at least two seconds to allow absorption of nasal secretions before
          withdrawal. Samples were then triple sealed in a container labelled as containing 'UN 3373
          biological substance category B', before being transported to the laboratory for immediate
          deactivation.
          Deactivation
          Samples were deactivated prior to analysis to reduce risk to analysts carrying out the study.
          Deactivation was done in a CL2 medical safety cabinet fitted with a Thermo Scientific 650 W
          High Capacity Dryer set to 60˚C. A glass thermometer was also placed inside the oven to
          verify the temperature being read by the digital display. Once samples arrived in the
          laboratory they were placed in the oven and left for 30 minutes in order to deactivate any live
          virus.22
          DESI analysis
          DESI stage was set up with the following optimised parameters. The DESI solvent used was
          a mixture of methanol/water at a ratio of 95:5. Flow rate was set to 30 µL/min, with the gas
          set at 5 bar (N2). Sprayer geometry was set to 2-3 mm distance from the inlet capillary and 1
          mm distance from the surface of the swab sample and at a 75˚ impact angle. The nozzle
          diameter was 200 µm and the capillary to nozzle diameter was 200 µm. Data was collected
          at 1 scan per second in continuum mode on a Waters Xevo G2-XS QToF mass
          spectrometer. Data was collected in the range of m/z 50-2000 for each sample.

          After DESI analysis Laser Desorption - Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometry
          (REIMS) analysis was performed on the swabs. Fundamentally the technique requires the
          samples to be rapidly heated using a Q-switched Optical Parametric Oscillator laser emitting
          at 2940nm. This process evaporates the sample creating an aerosol rich in molecular
          information. The aerosol is transferred in front of the MS inlet capillary, where the droplets
          are mixed with a matrix solvent (2-isopropanol). The solvent mixed droplets enter the
          vacuum of the instrument where they impact on a heated (1200K) collision surface. This
          highly energetic collision liberates free ions from the droplets which is analysed by a Waters
          Corporation Xevo G2-XS QToF mass spectrometer. Prior to use the mass spectrometer was
          calibrated using sodium formate in negative electrospray ionisation mode, following the
          manufacture’s standard operating instructions. All LD-REIMS data was collected in negative
          ionisation in the mass range of m/z 50 – 1500.
          Statistical analysis
          All acquired raw mass spectrometry files were imported into Abstract Model Builder (AMX)
          software (Waters Research Centre, Budapest, Hungary) for prepossessing. First, the data
          scans were combined into spectra, resulting in multiple spectra for each sample. The spectra
          were background subtracted and lockmass corrected to internal lipid and phospholipid
          species of m/z 255.233 and 885.5499 for LD-REIMS and DESI respectively. After lockmass
          correction, spectra were total ion content (TIC) normalised and binned to 0.1 Da. Principle
          component analysis was performed on the first 10 components (Figure 5). Both PCA and
          LDA identify linear combinations of variables within a dataset. PCA is an unsupervised
          technique that does not consider class separation of samples. LDA, however looks to
          identify linear relationships between variables taking into consideration class groupings and
          explicitly separates data according to these linear discriminants. PCA is initially used to
          reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and then supervised techniques are used to identify
          the relationship between the variables and build the models. The pre-processed data matrix
          was exported from AMX into Anaconda Spyder Python 3.7 and the sklearn support vector
          machine linear SVC algorithm was used for feature selection with L1 penalty norm and

          for leave one patient out cross validation and calculation of the diagnostic accuracy. Box
          plots of features were created using ggplot2 package in R.
