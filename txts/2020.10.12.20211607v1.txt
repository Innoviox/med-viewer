with an f-value greater than the AV45 critical f-value, the red circles represent ROIs from FDG scans with an f-value
greater than the FDG critical f-value, and the blue circles represent ROIs from PiB scans with an f-value greater than
the PiB critical f-value. The critical f-values are tabulated in Table 2.
