    Understanding SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence as a marker of prior infection in a spectrum of
    healthcare workers (HCWs) may guide risk stratification and enactment of better health policies
    and procedures.
    The present study reported on cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence and longevity of
    SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs at a regional hospital system in Orange County, California,
    between May and August, 2020.
    Data from HCWs (n=3,458) were included in the analysis. Data from first responders (n=226)
    were also analyzed for comparison. A blood sample was collected at study enrollment and 8-
    week follow-up. Information on job duties, location, COVID-19 symptoms, polymerase chain
    reaction test history, travel since January 2020, and household contacts with COVID-19 was
    collected. Comparisons to estimated community prevalence were also evaluated.
    Observed antibody prevalence was 0.93% and 2.58% at initial and 8-week follow-up,
    respectively, for HCWs, and 5.31% and 4.35% for first responders. For HCWs, significant
    differences (p < .05) between negative vs. positive at initial assessment were found for age, race,
    fever, and loss of smell, and at 8-week follow-up for age, race, and all symptoms. Antibody
    positivity persisted at least 8 weeks in this cohort. Among 75 HCWs with self-reported prior
    PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 35 (46.7%) were antibody negative. Significant differences between
    negative vs. positive were observed in age and frequency of symptoms.
                                                                 Page 1 of 12

    This study found considerably lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among HCWs compared
    with prior published studies. This may be explained by better safety measures in the workplace,
    heightened awareness inside and outside of the workplace, possibly lower susceptibility due to
    innate immunity and other biological heterogeneity, and low COVID-19 prevalence in the
    community itself. HCWs with initial positive results had persistent positive serologies at 8
    weeks. Further research is warranted to investigate factors influencing such lower prevalence in
    our HCWs.
    INTRODUCTION
    Since first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
    has given rise not only to a tremendous healthcare and socioeconomic crisis worldwide, but also
    to unprecedented psychological trauma to the world community, including healthcare workers
    (HCWs) and individuals, with a wide-ranging downstream impact and an anticipated prolonged
    recovery.
    COVID-19’s extraordinary infectivity, given its novel nature and pre-symptomatic transmission,
    has fueled its wide and wild spread across and within countries, with confirmed cumulative cases
    of 7.6 million in United States and 36.3 million worldwide as of October 8, 2020. A recent
    review article reports that approximately 40-45% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 could be
    asymptomatic for an extended period of time (e.g., beyond 14 days) or never develop symptoms,
    suggesting a much wider spread of the virus than confirmed cases indicate [1]. It is estimated
    that a ten-fold presence of infection exists for every confirmed case [2-4]. Some sub-sampled
    confined cohorts demonstrated asymptomatic prevalence as high as 96% [1,5]. Early anecdotal
    media reports suggested that HCWs were particularly vulnerable to infection. While great effort
    has been put into development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, it is of great importance to better
    understand the extent of transmission within health facilities, and the susceptibility of the health-
    care workforce to infection, so that better and prioritized preventive strategies can be developed
    and deployed.
    Sero-surveillance studies have been conducted to estimate SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in
    various countries and settings, including sero-surveillance among blood donors [6-8]. Such
    estimates help better understand the nature of total numbers of infected individuals to estimate
    the true infection mortality rate (vs. the case fatality rate). Equally if not more important, true
    infection prevalence and its change over time would better explain the nature of asymptomatic
    and pre- or peri-symptomatic transmissions, environmental differences, and possibly duration of
    antibody presence. This is particularly of interest in acute health care settings.
    However, previously reported results of sero-surveillance have varied greatly due to factors
    including sample size and geography (e.g., high active infection zones vs. low), ranging from
    57% prevalence in Bergamo, Italy [9], 12.5% in New York State [10], down to 4.7 % in Los
    Angeles County [11] and 2.8% in Santa Clara County [12], California. The reliability of some of
    the early methodology for measuring antibodies might have also contributed to these varying
    results [13].
                                                                 Page 2 of 12

    For HCWs, SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence has been sparsely reported but also with similar
    limitations as to sample size, wide range of results, timing of sampling, and variable
    methodologies. Such prevalence across different hospitals or healthcare networks ranges from
    89.3% in Wuhan, China (n = 424) [14], 35.8% in New York City (n = 285) [15], 13.7% in the
    greater New York city area (n=40,329) [16], to 7.4% in Milan, Italy [17], and 2.67% in Denmark
    (n = 28,792) showing higher association between positivity and job duties, younger age (<30),
    and self-reported suspicion of prior COVID-19 exposure and prior positive PCR testing [18].
    Determining such prevalence in a wide spectrum of HCWs, using a validated and accurate serum
    assay and repeated sampling over time to measure duration of antibody presence, may help
    stratify the work force for risk, limit transmission across different healthcare settings, enact
    better mitigation processes and procedures, and possibly better prioritize future vaccine delivery
    to front line workers.
    The present study reports and expands [19] on the sero-surveillance conducted among HCWs at
    Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian, Orange County, California, and subsequent follow-up at 8
    weeks. An additional smaller sample of sero-surveillance among first responders (e.g., fire
    captains, police officers) in Orange County, CA, as well as antibody positive prevalence
    calculated from community physician orders, are also reported for comparative purposes. The
    study was conducted between May and Aug, 2020.
    METHODS
    Subject Recruitment
    Institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained for this study from Providence St.
    Joseph Health IRB (IRB# 2020000337). Study HCW subjects were recruited by direct email
    notifications to the entire employee workforce (6,500+ individuals) and independent medical
    staff (1,600+ physicians), whose work locations include two hospital campuses, nine health
    centers, thirteen urgent care locations, and other clinical and administrative facilities all within
    approximately a 20-mile radius. Similarly, study subjects from first responders were recruited
    from fire and police departments in Orange County, CA, by direct email notifications.
    Enrollment and Data Collection
    Informed consents were obtained in person originally, then transitioned to electronic consent
    format starting June 19, 2020. Those who were enrolled through in-person consent were
    surveyed for job duties, location, COVID-19 symptoms, a self-reported polymerase chain
    reaction (PCR) test history with test date if available, travel record since January 2020, and
    existence of household contacts with COVID-19. Those who were enrolled through electronic
    consent format answered the same survey online at the time of consenting. The COVID-19
    symptoms survey included fever, sore throat, cough, runny nose, and loss of sense of smell, with
    loss of taste added at 8-week follow-up. Using reported job duties and locations, each HCW
    subject was classified into a) high (e.g., MD, RN, PA, emergency care tech, ICU tech), b)
    medium (e.g., therapist, phlebotomist, medical tech), or c) low (e.g., admin, coder, billing, lab
    tech/scientist, IT) risk groups to approximate levels of direct exposure to COVID-19 patients.
    Blood Sample Collection
                                                                 Page 3 of 12

    The first blood sample (~5ml) was collected for serum analysis for IgG antibodies to SARS-
    CoV-2 at the time of in-person consent, or following electronic consent at two main hospital
    campuses. With the exception of 16 subjects, blood sample collection was within 7 days of
    electronic consent (M = 1.77, SD = 1.83). Eight weeks after the first blood sample, the second
    sample was collected.
    IgG Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Analysis
    Serum analysis for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 utilized the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics
    VITROS® XT 7600 platform. A 5 ml peripheral draw venous blood sample was collected from
    each subject into a gold top serum separator vacutainer tube (BD Medical). Samples were
    centrifuged within 2 hours of collection at 4500 RPM for 5 minutes (RCF 3060). Aliquots were
    analyzed with calibrated lots of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG Reagent Pack on the VITROS® XT
    7600 according to manufacturer’s instructions for use [20]. Positive and negative quality controls
    were run daily prior to sample analysis (Ortho Diagnostics Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG Control). At
    the time of writing, this IgG test is approved only for use under the Food and Drug
    Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), and is also used in CDC studies [21].
    Manufacture sensitivity and specificity claims for the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS Anti-
    SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay is 100% (407/407) negative agreement (95% CI: 99.1–100.0%) in 407
    presumed SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative subjects and 87.5% (42/48) positive agreement (95%
    CI: 74.8–95.3%) in 48 PCR positive subjects with days from positive PCR ranging from 1 day to
    22 days and days from onset of symptoms ranging from 12 to 32 days. In-house validation
    studies were conducted with 35 samples from subjects with a known positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR
    test a mean of 43 days out from positive PCR test date (range 38-48 days), and 50 samples from
    subjects with a known negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Of 31 PCR samples, 29 were positive
    for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. All 50 of the PCR negative samples were SARS-CoV-2 IgG
    antibody negative. Thus, sensitivity of 93.6% (95%CI: 78.6–99.2%) and specificity of 100%
    (95% CI: 92.9–100.0%) were calculated for the Ortho Diagnostics VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2
    IgG assay in run our laboratory on the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS® XT 7600
    automated instrument platform, and adopted in this study.
    Data Analysis
    Data were examined for HCWs and first responders at first and second blood draw results, each
    comparing antibody negativity vs. positivity. Nonparametric tests for group differences were
    performed for demographics and five symptoms of COVID-19 at the first blood draw, with an
    additional one symptom at the second blood draw. The effect of occupational risk was also
    evaluated for HCWs. Mann-Whitney U tests were used for assessing group difference in age, and
    a series of one-sided Fisher’s exact tests were used for the remaining categorical factors; for
    group differences in race (a 7×2 table) and occupational risk (a 3×2 table), the Mehta-Patel
    algorithm was applied [22]. A value of p < .05 was used for statistical significance. For all
    analyses, the Stata statistical software package, edition 15, was used [23].
    RESULTS

    After excluding subjects for missing symptoms data, the final analyses included 3,458 subjects
    from the first blood draw and the subset of those who returned for the second draw (n = 2,754;
    79.6% return rate) for HCWs, and 226 subjects from first blood draw and the subset of those
    who returned for the second draw (n = 92; 40.7% return rate) for first responders.
    Among HCWs’ initial blood draw, 32 antibody positive cases (3,426 negative) were identified,
    with an observed prevalence of 0.93% (exact binomial 95% CI = 0.63% - 1.30%). Accounting
    for test sensitivity (93.6%) and specificity (100%), an adjusted prevalence of 0.98% (exact
    binomial 95% CI = 0.68% - 1.37%) was calculated, indicating 34 positive cases (3,424 negative)
    after adjustment. At their 8-week follow-up blood draw (n=2,754), 71 antibody positive cases
    (2,683 negative) were identified, with an observed prevalence of 2.58% (exact binomial 95% CI
    = 2.02% - 3.24%). Of the original 32 positive subjects, 28 remained positive (4 did not return for
    the second blood draw) with additional 43 new cases during an 8-week period (Table 1a). An
    adjusted prevalence of 2.76% (exact binomial 95% CI = 2.18% - 3.44%) was calculated,
    indicating 76 positive cases (2,678 negative) after adjustment. Table 2 summarizes HCW sample
    characteristics and group differences.

    Note. Group difference testing was performed with Mann-Whitney U tests for age and with Fisher’s exact tests for
    categorical measures.
    Nonparametric tests for group differences were performed for demographics and six symptoms
    of COVID-19. Significant differences between observed negative vs. positive cases at initial
    assessment were found for age (z = 2.396), race, fever, and loss of smell. At 8-week follow-up,
    significant differences were found for age (z = 4.718), race, and all symptoms (p’s < .05).
    Occupational risk did not contribute significantly to negative vs. positive group differences at
    either blood draw time point.
    Among first responders’ initial blood draw, 12 antibody positive cases (214 negative) were
    identified, with an observed prevalence of 5.31% (exact binomial 95% CI = 2.77% - 9.09%).
    Accounting for test sensitivity and specificity, an adjusted prevalence of 5.75% (exact binomial
    95% CI = 3.10% - 9.64%) was calculated, indicating 13 positive cases (213 negative) after
    adjustment. Significant differences were found for the symptoms of fever, cough, and loss of
    smell (p’s < .05). At their 8-week follow-up blood draw (n = 92), 4 antibody positive cases (88
    negative) were identified, with an observed prevalence of 4.35% (exact binomial 95% CI =
    1.20% - 10.76%) – an original 1 case remained antibody positive (11 did not return for the
    second blood draw) with an additional 3 new cases during an 8-weeks period (Table 1b).
    Adjusted prevalence was equal to observed prevalence. See Table 3 for first responder sample
    characteristics and group differences.

    Note. Group difference testing was performed with Mann-Whitney U tests for age and with Fisher’s exact tests for
    categorical measures.
    Given our observed 8-week antibody persistence in HCWs, we also conducted an extrapolated
    prevalence calculation for the 8-week follow-up to include those with antibody positives at the
    first blood draw and who did not return for the second draw (see Table 1). For HCWs, adding
    these 4 cases (total positive n = 75) resulted in a prevalence of 2.72% (exact binomial 95% CI =
    2.14% - 3.40%). Similarly adding 11 cases in the first responders (positive n = 15) resulted in a
    prevalence of 14.56% (exact binomial 95% CI = 8.39% - 22.88%). Table 4 summarizes

    Among HCWs with previously PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (n = 75), 40 (53.3%)
    were antibody positive with 35 negative (46.7%) at 8-week follow-up. None of the negative 35
    had a history of hospitalization or severe illness. While gender, race, and occupational risk did
    not significantly contribute to group differences between antibody negatives vs. positives, age
    and frequency of all symptoms were significantly different (p’s < .05), with positives
    significantly younger and presenting more symptoms than negatives. Among those with
    available PCR test date, time between PCR and antibody test ranged from 16 to 94 days (M =
    41.33, SD = 23.27) for the negatives (n = 9) and from 12 to 151 days (M = 59.69, SD = 41.90)
    for the positives (n = 35), with no significant difference, t(42) = -1.26, p = .215. Table 5

    DISCUSSION
    Compared to other published studies, the present study found a considerably lower adjusted
    antibody prevalence (0.98%) on initial sampling (95.9% blood drawn in May and June) among
    HCWs as previously reported [19]. The community prevalence during this early period, when
                                                                 Page 8 of 12

    still under “shelter at home” orders under the Governor of California, was relatively low (3.64%)
    as reflected by those tested by physician order in our community, and this is reflected in adjusted
    prevalence among the first responders tested in this study (5.75%), although it is considerably
    higher than that of HCWs. While selection bias likely affected our estimate of community
    prevalence in serum drawn from physician orders, the antibody prevalence studies in local
    Southern California support our estimate [11,12]. The second period (100% blood drawn in July
    and August) reflected wider community transmission after partial state re-opening, as evidenced
    by a spike of hospitalization in Orange County, yet the higher adjusted prevalence rate in our
    HCWs (2.76%) was still well below of the considerably higher prevalence (22.47%), estimated
    from physician orders, in our community.
    Several factors for the relatively low sero-prevalence in our HCWs may explain current findings.
    Upon reporting of the first COVID-19 patient in California (the third in the United States), our
    organization reacted immediately. We established an internal, weekly COVID-19 task force
    meeting and opened regular communication with the Orange County Healthcare Agency as well
    as the CDC to stay current with the rapidly changing guidelines from county, state, and federal
    agencies. The task force oversaw to date a rigorous approach to preparedness, including resource
    allocation (e.g., personal protective equipment, cohorted emergency room and hospital beds as
    well as ICU beds, dedicated staff) and hospital triage and process protocols, environmental
    cleansing and dietary rigor, rigorous visitation policies, all to amplify patients’ and workforces’
    safety and infection prevention measures. Mandatory employee education and training on safety
    measures and prevention were implemented, heightening awareness among employees not only
    at work but more importantly outside of their work place. All those efforts may have contributed
    to this lower prevalence.
    A relatively low regional estimated overall prevalence of infections in Orange County (total
    population of 3.2 million) also contributed to this low prevalence. This geographical effect can
    be seen in high antibody prevalence in HCWs in New York city, New York, USA, Wuhan,
    China, and Bergamo, Italy, where much higher community prevalence was reported. When our
    data were compared, using the economic re-opening in our county as a cut-off, between
    May/June vs. July/August, the low observed prevalence for both our HCWs (0.93% vs. 2.58%)
    and those tested by physician orders (3.6% vs. 22.5%) was reinforced. Incidentally, this trend
    was not observed for first responders, possibly due to smaller sample size and a large percentage
    of non-returning subjects at 8-week follow-up (although our expletory prevalence calculation did
    show this trend - 5.31% vs. 14.56%). Therefore, regional consideration must be given when
    considering antibody prevalence in HCWs.
    Another possible explanation for lower susceptibility to infection among HCWs is the pre-
    existing presence of innate immunity [24] in HCWs acquired through T-cell mediated25 cross-
    reactivity to more common coronaviruse species [26-28]. This hypothesis postulates that greater
    exposure to such predecessors is experienced more commonly in hospital settings than the
    community at large. Recent studies document up to a 30% presence of such innate immunity in
    non-infected family members of those with confirmed infection. Prevalence of such pre-existing
    innate immunity in sampled blood donors prior to the epidemic has also been documented [6,29].
    This phenomenon of innate immunity may also help explain the relatively low rate of infection
                                                                 Page 9 of 12

    susceptibility in younger children, given the common exposure to every day viral infections in
    pre-school and grade school [30-32].
    Among HCWs with self-reported PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 46.7% were antibody negative
    (Table 5), which cannot be fully explained by antibody test sensitivity and specificity itself.
    Recent studies found a rapid decay of IgG antibody within the possible span of 2-3 months in
    patients with milder COVID-19 symptoms [24]. This may support our findings of the negative
    cases with significantly fewer symptoms compared to the positives. It should be noted that the
    loss of antibody positivity is not equivalent to loss of immunity [24]. This finding warrants
    further research in a larger cohort.
    CONCLUSIONS
    Our findings suggest that the recommended in-patient personal protective equipment is effective
    in reducing the risk to HCWs and raising the confidence in those who need hospital care for
    urgent conditions to not delay seeking it. Also, the unexpected finding of lower rates of serologic
    conversion in our HCWs suggests the possibility that innate immunity may be greater among the
    HCWs, a hypothesis warranting further studies. Finally, the fact that all of our sero-positive
    HCWs have maintained antibody positivity for at least 8 weeks, with no reported re-infection, is
    encouraging, given the earlier reports of antibody evanescence [33,34].
