        1      Objectives: To determine whether noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy occurs in
        2      humans.
        3      Design: Young workers with occupational noise-exposure from a shipyard were
        4      recruited for participation in the current study. Age-matched workers in the same
        5      shipyard who had no noise-exposure were enrolled in the control group. The
        6      speech-in-noise scores, gap detection thresholds and SP/AP values were tested and
        7      compared between the two groups. The correlations of both the speech-in-noise
        8      scores and the gap detection threshold with the SP/AP value were calculated and
        9      analyzed.
      10       Results: Our results demonstrated that even within the normal auditory threshold,
      11       individuals with occupational noise exposure showed lower speech-in-noise scores
      12       and higher gap detection threshold and SP/AP values. Speech-in-noise score was
      13       correlated SP/AP value. The electrocochleography values showed no significant
      14       correlation with the gap detection threshold.
      15       Conclusion: The result confirmed that noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy occurs
      16       in humans with occupational noise exposure. However, they also implied that the
      17       mechanism of cochlear synaptopathy in humans is more complicated than that in
      18       experimental animals.

        1                                                 INTRODUCTION
        2      In the ENT clinic, patients often complain of hearing problems with pure-tone
        3      hearing thresholds within normal ranges. This is called clinical hidden hearing loss
        4      (cHHL). Difficulty hearing in noisy environments and the fast speech condition are
        5      the most common hearing defects in these individuals. It is challenging to unearth
        6      the evidence and the function of hearing impairment in cHHL individuals with only
        7      the regular clinical hearing test.
        8             Recently, animal studies showed that noise-induced damage to the synapse
        9      between inner hair cells and type I afferent auditory nerve fibers may occur in the
      10       absence of a permanent threshold shift (Furman et al. 2013; Kujawa et al. 2009;
      11       Valero et al. 2017). These characteristic morphologic changes in the cochlea are
      12       termed cochlear synaptopathy, and this sort of hearing impairment is termed
      13       noise-induced hidden hearing loss (nHHL). Along with synapses and afferent
      14       auditory nerve fiber injure, other coding deficiencies, including loudness and
      15       temporal resolution, were also observed. For instance, Shi et al. (Shi et al. 2016)
      16       found that the click-evoked compound action potential (CAP) amplitude was
      17       reduced after noise exposure in nHHL guinea pigs. Song et al. (Song et al. 2016)
      18       showed that the click-evoked CAP amplitude decreased with prolonged peak latency.
      19       Other studies also reported a significant reduction in the auditory brainstem response
      20       (ABR) I wave amplitude in nHHL rodents (Furman et al. 2013; Kujawa and
      21       Liberman 2009; Lin et al. 2011). Although the loudness and temporal deficits in
      22       cHHL individuals with normal hearing are almost identical to those in noise-exposed
                                                                        4

        1      nHHL rodents, there is a lack of convincing direct pathologic evidence that
        2      noise-exposed human beings have cochlear synaptopathy.
        3             Due to the absence of cochlear pathologic evidence, some electrophysiological
        4      values, such as the ABR Wave I amplitude (Schaette et al. 2011; Stamper et al. 2015),
        5      the ABR wave V latency (Mehraei et al. 2016), the frequency-following response
        6      (FFR) (Plack et al. 2016) and the ratio of summating potential relative to the action
        7      potential (SP/AP) (Liberman et al. 2016), have been reported as indicators of
        8      cochlear synaptopathy. Some of the electrophysiological indicators showed that
        9      cochlear synaptopathy and auditory nerve fiber degeneration also occurred in the
      10       cHHL population. Stamper and Johnson (Stamper and Johnson 2015) reported a
      11       decrease in ABR Wave I amplitude as a function of noise exposure during the
      12       previous 12 months in normal-hearing human ears. Schaette and McAlpine (Schaette
      13       and McAlpine 2011) found a significant reduction in amplitude of the ABR Wave I
      14       in human subjects with tinnitus and a normal audiogram. Liberman et al. (Liberman
      15       et al. 2016) reported that the value of SP/AP increased in the high-risk group. Even
      16       so, it remains controversial that which indicator was the most appropriate. For
      17       instance, Plack et al. (Plack et al. 2016) and Mehraei et al. (Mehraei et al. 2016)
      18       argued that the ABR Wave I amplitude shows high variability both between and
      19       within individuals, and it was so difficult to measure in humans that it was not
      20       recommended. Liberman et al. (Liberman et al. 2016) reported a larger SP/AP value
      21       in the high-risk group; however, no significant difference was found in Wave I
      22       amplitude between groups. In summary, the electrophysiological indicators used in
                                                                        5

        1      noise exposure research in humans should be chosen deliberately to avoid unreliable
        2      findings.
        3             The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to explore whether noise-exposed
        4      individuals showed cHHL and cochlear synaptopathy and (2) to examine the
        5      correlation between cHHL and cochlear synaptopathy in those individuals. Studies
        6      have showed that other factors, including aging (Fischer et al. 2019; Johannesen et al.
        7      2019; Parthasarathy et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2018) and ototoxic drugs (Liu et al. 2015;
        8      Liu et al. 2013) also cause cochlear synaptopathy. In humans, the pathogenesis and
        9      mechanism of cHHL are complicated and may include, for example, noise exposure
      10       history mixed with aging or ototoxicity. To differentiate the effect of noise exposure
      11       on the human auditory system, noise-exposed young workers from a shipyard were
      12       recruited for participation in the current study. The individuals enrolled in the hidden
      13       hearing loss (HHL) risk group underwent rigorous screenings. Age-matched workers
      14       in the same shipyard who had no noise exposure were enrolled in the control group.
      15       Both the speech-in-noise scores and gap detection threshold were investigated in two
      16       groups and used as indicators of cHHL. The SP/AP value was applied as the
      17       indicator of nHHL. The speech-in-noise scores, gap detection threshold and SP/AP
      18       value were compared between the two groups. Finally, the correlation of both the
      19       speech-in-noise scores and the gap detection threshold with the SP/AP value was
      20       calculated and analyzed.

        8      Participant recruitment
        9             The individuals in the HHL risk group and the control group were recruited
      10       from the factory of a shipyard. Individuals were instructed to fill in a questionnaire,
      11       and sex, age, handedness, auditory disease and ototoxicity history, working
      12       department, working hours per week and working age data were collected. An
      13       otoscope examine was performed to check the external auditory canal and tympanic
      14       membrane for both ears. Hearing thresholds of both ears were evaluated in all
      15       participants for free. Pure-tone thresholds of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and
      16       8000 Hz were tested. Enrollment criteria in the HHL risk group including (1) age
      17       between 20 and 40 years old, (2) no ear disease or ototoxicity history, (3) hearing
      18       threshold of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, 8000 Hz at less than or equal to 25
      19       dB HL, (4) more than or equal to 3 working years in the noisy department.
      20       Enrollment criteria in the control group were the same as those in the HHL risk
      21       group except that they had no noise exposure history or shooting habits.

        1      Noise exposure measurement
        2             Occupational noise-exposed individuals were instructed to wear the Aihua
        3      ASV5910 type personal exposure dosimeter (Hangzhou Aihua Instruments Co., Ltd,
        4      China) while at work, based on the standards of IEC 61672:2002 and IEC
        5      61252:2002, to measure the equivalent sound pressure level (Leq) over a continuous
        6      8 hours (8:00 AM. to 4:00 PM), the maximum acoustic pressure level (LFmax), and
        7      the minimum acoustic pressure level (LFmin) during weekdays. Dosimeters were
        8      calibrated by the Aihua AWA6221A type acoustic calibrator based on the standards
        9      of IEC 60942:2003, and the data were then imported into a computer. The
      10       occupational noise Leq of 8 hours is 89.4 ± 7.8 decibel A Weighted (dBA).
      11
      12       Speech-in-noise test
      13              The original speech material was the Mandarin version of the Hearing in Noise
      14       Test (MHINT). The MHINT contains 14 lists that contains 20 sentences each. Each
      15       sentence contains 10 key words. The scores are expressed as percentages of the key
      16       words that were heard correctly. The MHINT sentences were recorded with a male
      17       speaker. The stimuli were presented at 65 dB (A) and were delivered bilaterally
      18       through Sennheiser HD580 headphones. In sentence recognition in noise,
      19       speech-shaped noise was presented at 65 dB (A) bilaterally as speech signals. The
      20       noise began 500 ms before the sentence and continued for 500 ms after the sentence
      21       had finished.
      22              All participants had no experience with any speech tests before this study.
                                                                        8

        1      Before the formal test, participants practiced as many times as they wished and were
        2      provided feedback to become familiar with stimuli. In the formal test, they were
        3      instructed to repeat the sentences as accurately as possible. Each sentence was
        4      played only once, and no feedback was provided in the formal tests.
        5
        6      Gap detection threshold test
        7             The gap detection threshold test was measured in a three-interval forced-choice
        8      procedure. For the gap marker, white noise was low-pass filtered at cutoff
        9      frequencies of 1, 2, and 4 kHz via 3000th-order finite impulse response filter with an
      10       approximately −116 dB/octave filter slope. In brief, a three-interval forced-choice
      11       program was run on MATLAB software (version 7.0). Three buttons were presented
      12       on a monitor to the participant who was asked to indicate which one of the three
      13       stimuli were different (i.e., which of the three stimuli was inserted with a gap).
      14              Details of the gap detection threshold test may be found in Li. et al 2017(Li et
      15       al. 2017).

      17       Electrocochleography recording
      18              Electrocochleography recordings were collected using a commercial device
      19       (Intelligent Hearing Systems, US) with Smart EP software. The electrode impedance
      20       values were all less than 5 kΩ, and the interelectrode impedance was within 1 kΩ. A
      21       silver electrode with cotton and electrode gel was applied as the reference electrode
      22       in the ear canal. An electromagnetically shielded insert earphone (ER-3) was applied
                                                                        9

        1      to deliver click stimulation to the test ear at 90 dB nHL in alternating polarity at a
        2      rate of 7.1/sec. The recorded potentials were amplified by a factor of 50,000 and
        3      filtered with 10 Hz (high-pass) and 3000 Hz (low-pass) filters. Averaged responses
        4      over 512 sweeps were acquired. The SP/AP of each ear was determined separately
        5      by two experienced audiologists. The mean SP/AP value from the two audiologists
        6      was calculated for electrocochleography value.

      11       the study. There were 60 participants (24 females) in control group and 60
      12       participants (27 females) in the HHL risk group. The mean (SD) ages of the
      13       participants were 28 (4) years for the control group and 28 (4) years for the HHL risk
      14       group. Independent-samples t-test showed that the age difference of the two groups
      15       was not significant (t = - 0.498, p = 0.620). Fig. 1 shows the audiograms of the
      16       participants in the control group and the HHL risk group.

        2      participants were 95.72 (2.24) for the control group and 92.78 (4.12) for the HHL
        3      risk group. Independent-samples t-test showed that the control group performed
        4      significantly better than the HHL risk group (t = 4.864, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2).

        7             The gap detection thresholds in the groups varied in terms of gap marker cutoff
        8      frequency, as shown in Figure 3. Generally, the gap threshold of the control group
        9      was lower than that of the HHL risk group at the same gap marker. Data derived
      10       from subjects with the same gap marker frequencies were analyzed by
      11       independent-samples t-test. A significant difference was only observed for the 4kHz
      12       gap marker (t = -2.790, p = 0.006). No significant difference was evident at the 2kHz
      13       gap marker (t = -0.764, p = 0.447) or 1kHz gap marker (t = -1.356, p = 0.178) (Fig.

        1      = 0.011). Second, the worse (higher) SP/AP values of the two ears in each individual
        2      were compared between the two groups. The independent-samples t-test showed that
        3      the differences were also significant (t = -2.589, p = 0.011). Finally, the SP/AP
        4      values of the ear on the same as that of the handedness were compared. No
        5      significant differences were founded in the independent-samples t-test (t = -1.486, p
        6      = 0.140). Each SP/AP value comparison is displayed in Fig. 4.

      10              We explored the relationship between the speech-in-noise score, gap detection
      11       and the electrocochleography value by calculating Pearson correlations. For the
      12       electrocochleography values, the mean, worse and handedness sides were all
      13       calculated. The results showed that the speech-in-noise score was significantly
      14       correlated with the mean SP/AP value and the worse SP/AP value. None of the three
      15       electrocochleography values showed a significant correlation with the gap threshold.
      16       The results of the Pearson correlation analysis are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

        1      and higher gap detection thresholds and SP/AP values, which are indicative of cHHL
        2      and cochlear synaptopathy. The speech-in-noise scores were correlated with the
        3      SP/AP values. None of the three electrocochleography values showed a significant
        4      correlation with gap thresholds.
        5             Recently, a variety of noninvasive measures have been used to determine
        6      whether noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy occurs in humans (N. Bramhall et al.
        7      2015; N. F. Bramhall et al. 2017; Fulbright et al. 2017; Grinn et al. 2017; Grose et al.
        8      2017; Guest et al. 2017; Guest et al. 2018; Liberman et al. 2016; Stamper and
        9      Johnson 2015; Valderrama et al. 2018). However, the results are conflicting.
      10       Postmortem temporal bone studies have demonstrated that cochlear synaptopathy
      11       and neural degeneration exist widely among humans (Makary et al. 2011; Viana et al.
      12       2015), even in young adults (Wu et al. 2018). Animal studies have proven that aging,
      13       noise exposure and ototoxicity drugs all cause cochlear synaptopathy (Kujawa and
      14       Liberman 2009; Liu et al. 2015; Sergeyenko et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2020). As a
      15       result, cochlear synaptopathy probably exists widely among humans, and multiple
      16       different mechanisms, such as aging, noise exposure and ototoxicity drugs, could be
      17       involved. Therefore, it is harder to find the main cause of cochlear synaptopathy in
      18       different people.
      19              Whether noise exposure causes cochlear synaptopathy in the auditory system
      20       depends on the sound pressure level and the exposure time of the noise (Fernandez et
      21       al. 2015). Whether noise exposure is the major cause of cochlear synaptopathy
      22       depends on the noise exposure dose differences between the chosen populations. In
                                                                        13

        1      previous studies, a self-reported questionnaire was applied for noise exposure dose
        2      estimation and grouping. The self-reported questionnaire was easier to complete but
        3      depended mainly on the subjective impressions of the individuals. Lacking the exact
        4      exposure dose could lead to unreliable consequences when the self-reported
        5      questionnaire is applied to estimate the degree of cochlear synaptopathy between
        6      different individuals. In other words, the comparison of electrophysiological
        7      characteristics between the high-risk and low-risk groups based on a self-reported
        8      questionnaire does not always achieve satisfactory results. In contrast, using definite
        9      occupational noise measurements and exposure years is more reliable. It could also
      10       highlight the primary mechanisms and other reasons that lead to cochlear
      11       synaptopathy. This is the main reason that we achieved significant results.
      12              The second reason is that the participants we recruited in the study were
      13       particularly young and age-matched. As mentioned above, different mechanisms,
      14       such as aging, noise exposure and ototoxicity drugs, could play important roles in
      15       cochlear synaptopathy. Researchers have tried to determine the relative contributions
      16       of age and noise exposure in predicting measures of cochlear synaptopathy. However,
      17       the result was inconsistent with the predicted effects of synaptopathy (Prendergast et
      18       al. 2019). This implied that it is probably difficult to distinguish the effects of aging
      19       and noise exposure on cochlear synaptopathy in humans. Hence, it is easier to find a
      20       significant difference when the age range is narrowed, and the noise exposure dose is
      21       expanded between groups. In our study, the mean age in both control and HHL risk
      22       groups was approximately 28 years. Reports have shown that the negative effect of
                                                                        14

        1      aging on cochlear synaptopathy occurs at an early age (Wu et al. 2018). The limited
        2      age range for study inclusion also restrained the aging effect on cochlear
        3      synaptopathy. This is also an important reason that we achieved significant results.
        4             Our results confirmed the negative effect of noise exposure on speech-in-noise
        5      score and temporal resolution, such as the gap detection threshold. Correlation
        6      analysis also showed that speech-in-noise scores were significantly correlated with
        7      the cochlear synaptopathy. However, the underlying mechanism is rather
        8      complicated. The ability of speech perception in noise requires not only intact
        9      peripheral auditory function but also intact central auditory factors such as attention,
      10       working memory and language. Cochlear synaptopathy could be one of the main
      11       deficits in peripheral auditory function. Prior studies have demonstrated that noise
      12       exposure also has a negative effect on the central auditory pathway. For example,
      13       Dewey et al. reported that fMRI responses throughout the auditory system were
      14       greater in individuals with higher lifetime noise exposure levels than in controls with
      15       low lifetime noise exposure levels (Dewey et al. 2020).
      16              In Conclusion, compared to the control group, young individuals with a normal
      17       auditory threshold and long-term occupational noise exposure showed lower
      18       speech-in-noise scores and a higher gap detection threshold. Significant cochlear
      19       synaptopathy was also found in the noise-exposed individuals and was correlated
      20       with speech-in-noise scores.
