13     Abstract: T-cell immunity is likely to play a role in protection against SARS-CoV-2 by helping
14     generate neutralizing antibodies. We longitudinally studied CD4 T-cell responses to the M, N, and
15     S structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in 21 convalescent individuals. Within the first two months
16     following symptom onset, a majority of individuals (81%) mount at least one CD4 T-cell response,
17     and 48% of individuals mount detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific peripheral T follicular helper cells
18     (pTfh, defined as CXCR5+PD1+ CD4 T cells). SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh responses across all
19     three protein specificities correlate with antibody neutralization with the strongest correlation
20     observed for S protein-specific responses. When examined over time, pTfh responses increase
21     in frequency and magnitude in convalescence, and robust responses with magnitudes greater
22     than 5% were detected only at the second convalescent visit, an average of 38 days post-
23     symptom onset. These data deepen our understanding of antigen-specific pTfh responses in
24     SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that M and N protein-specific pTfh may also assist in the
25     development of neutralizing antibodies and that pTfh response formation may be delayed in
26     SARS-CoV-2 infection.

31     Author Summary: Since December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
32     has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most currently licensed vaccines are
33     understood to protect against infection by inducing neutralizing antibodies. As such, ongoing
34     COVID-19 vaccine trials have focused on antibody neutralization as a primary immunologic
35     endpoint. It is well established that T follicular helper cells are essential to the development of
36     neutralizing antibodies and that a subset of these cells, peripheral T follicular helper cells (pTfh),
37     can be studied in the blood. However, little is known about Tfh responses mounted in SARS-CoV-
38     2 infection. Here, we studied pTfh to three major structural proteins in individuals recovered from
39     COVID-19. We find that SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh frequencies correlate with neutralizing
40     antibody responses, especially those directed against the spike protein. We also find that pTfh
41     responses to SARS-CoV-2 increase over time. Our findings suggest that pTfh responses against
42     proteins other than the spike protein may contribute to the development of neutralizing antibodies
43     and suggests that formation of pTfh responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be delayed.

44     Introduction
45               Cases of COVID-19, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
46     2 (SARS-CoV-2), were first reported in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 (1). Since then, the
47     COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity, mortality, and economic disruption
48     worldwide (2). In SARS-CoV-2 infection, initial studies reported significant lymphopenia in
49     hospitalized patients (3). An elevation of both activation and exhaustion markers on T cells in both
50     severe and mild disease has also been described (4-6). More recently, data on antigen-specific
51     T-cell responses in individuals recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection has emerged. These
52     studies have reported CD4 T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 80-100% of convalescent
53     individuals, with most publications focusing on the Spike (S) protein (7-10).
54               Several SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy trials are in progress, and recent Phase I/II trial
55     data have highlighted the presence of neutralizing antibodies as evidence of plausible vaccine
56     efficacy (11-13). Although the key components of a protective immune response against SARS-
57     CoV-2 remain unclear, studies in non-human primates have found that neutralizing antibodies
58     (nAb) are a correlate of protection in infection and vaccination (14, 15). With this in mind, a better
59     understanding of how T-cell responses contribute to the formation of nAb is critical to optimizing
60     future vaccine design.
61               Because direct study of lymphoid tissues in humans is difficult, peripheral T follicular cells
62     (pTfh), or T follicular helper cells (Tfh) circulating in the blood, serve as an important surrogate for
63     understanding Tfh responses within germinal centers. While there is some controversy regarding
64     how to best identify these cells, there is general consensus that these cells express CXCR5, a
65     lymph node homing receptor, and many groups use PD1 expression in conjunction with CXCR5
66     to define pTfh (16-18). While frequencies of circulating CXCR5+PD1+ CD4 T cells are typically
67     low, these cells are closely linked to Tfh in lymphoid tissue (19) and have been shown to support
68     humoral responses (20, 21). Antigen-specific pTfh have been shown to correlate with neutralizing
69     antibodies in the context of infection and vaccination of several pathogens (17, 22-26). Although
                                                                                                                                          3

70     pTfh responses have not been described in the context of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection,
71     CD4 T-cell responses have been shown to be important in controlling SARS-CoV in mouse
72     models (27), and a recent study of a MERS-CoV vaccine in mice found that Tfh frequencies in
73     draining lymph nodes correlated with neutralizing antibodies (28).
74               Data on SARS-CoV-2-specific T follicular helper cell responses are also limited.
75     Thevarajan et al. was the first to report on pTfh frequencies in SARS-CoV-2, and found that
76     frequencies of total pTfh increased during acute infection (29). Since then, a few studies have
77     drawn a correlation between total CD4 T cell or total Tfh-like cell frequencies and antibody levels
78     (30, 31). Another study found increased expression of CXCR5 and ICOS, two Tfh markers, on
79     SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T-cells but did not examine pTfh responses directly (32). In deceased
80     donors with COVID-19, Kaneko et al. recently reported that BCL6-expression in germinal center
81     Tfh was lost within thoracic lymph nodes. This study suggests that Tfh response formation may
82     be impaired in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (33), but how this affects the formation of antigen
83     specific Tfh responses is unclear.
84               The most direct examination of pTfh to date was conducted by Juno et al, where circulating
85     Tfh in the blood were defined as CD45RA-CXCR5+ CD4 T cells. They demonstrated a correlation
86     between S protein-specific pTfh and nAb, suggesting that Tfh responses are formed in mild
87     SARS-CoV-2 infection (34). However, these data leave several questions unanswered, including
88     at what point in convalescence these responses evolve and whether Tfh specific for other SARS-
89     CoV-2 proteins contribute to the formation of neutralizing antibodies. While this study was a useful
90     first glimpse at antigen-specific Tfh responses, it did not examine PD1 expression, a canonical
91     Tfh marker, and used the activation markers, Ox40 and CD25, to identify antigen-specific
92     responses, which have previously been shown include a high percentage of T regulatory cells
93     (35). It is also important to note that pTfh specificity does not necessarily correspond with
94     neutralizing antibody specificity. For example, in HIV infection and vaccination, intrastructural help
95     occurs, where CD4 T-cell responses to internal, structural proteins correlated with neutralizing
                                                                                                                                          4

 96     antibodies against the exterior, envelope protein (36, 37). These studies underscore the
 97     importance of examining pTfh responses across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome.
 98               Here, we report on SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T-cell responses to the membrane (M),
 99     nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) proteins studied longitudinally in 21 convalescent individuals. We
100     directly examined antigen-specific pTfh (CXCR5+PD1+ CD4 T cells) and observed correlations
101     between antigen-specific pTfh responses across all protein specificities and antibody
102     neutralization, with the strongest correlation observed for S protein-specific pTfh frequencies.
103     High magnitude SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh responses (>5% activation of total pTfh population)
104     were only detected at the second convalescent visit, more than 30 days following symptom onset.
105     These data are the first to examine the kinetics of pTfh responses that arise after SARS-CoV-2
106     infection as well as the relationship between neutralizing antibodies and pTfh responses to the
107     SARS-CoV-2 M and N proteins. These results also suggest that pTfh formation may be delayed
108     in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

110     Results:
111     SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells target the M, N, and S proteins in individuals recovered
112     from COVID-19 at their first convalescent visit.
113               In 21 individuals recovered from COVID-19, we assessed the presence of T-cell
114     responses to the membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using
115     overlapping 20mer peptide pools spanning each protein. All but two of these individuals were
116     confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR, and the two who were not PCR tested had a
117     known COVID-19 contact and detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses. While none of
118     these individuals required hospitalization, all experienced COVID-19 related symptoms, and a
119     majority (71%) reported a moderate severity of symptoms. T-cell responses were measured at
120     the first convalescent visit for each individual, which occurred an average of 22 days post-
121     symptom onset while the second visit was an average of 39 days post-symptom onset (Table 1).

127               Representative positive CD4 T-cell responses measured by each staining strategy are
128     shown in Fig 1A for AIM and in Fig 1B for ICS in one individual, CR8, who mounted CD4 T-cell
129     responses against all three SARS-CoV-2 proteins. At the first convalescent visit, we found that
130     57% (12/21) of individuals mounted a SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T-cell response by AIM and that
131     these CD4 responses targeted all three tested proteins with similar frequencies (Fig 1C).
132     Meanwhile, by ICS, 47% (10/21) of individuals had at least one SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4
133     response at this visit, with a similar distribution across the tested proteins (Fig 1D). As a control,
134     we also measured T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools in COVID-19 negative
135     individuals by assaying samples collected from healthy individuals before the COVID-19
136     pandemic. In the healthy controls tested, we detected three low magnitude (≤0.17%), presumably
137     cross-reactive memory CD4 T-cell responses in two of the ten tested individuals (20%) in line with
138     previously published reports (8). Representative staining of an AIM-detected and an ICS-detected

139     response in healthy controls is shown in S2A-B Fig, with overall responder frequencies presented
140     in S2C-D Fig. Overall, our data show that nearly half of convalescent individuals mounted a
141     SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 T-cell response as detected by both activation marker expression and
142     cytokine production.
143               While there was a weak correlation between the response magnitude for AIM and ICS for
144     each condition (S3A Fig), more responses were identified by upregulation of activation-induced
145     marker expression than by intracellular cytokine staining. There were 12 responses detected by
146     only AIM that were not positive on ICS, but only one response was detected by ICS only (S3B Fig).
147     These data show that a significant portion of CD4 responses detected in early convalescence were
148     not detected by cytokine (IFNγ, TNFα, or CD154) staining and highlight the increased sensitivity
149     of AIM for detecting total CD4 T-cell responses.
150
151     SARS-CoV-2-specific peripheral T follicular helper cells are detected in convalescent
152     individuals.
153               We directly measured antigen-specific pTfh responses by the upregulation of Ox40 and
154     PDL1 on CXCR5+PD1+ CD4 T cells (gating strategy shown in S1 Fig). Representative examples
155     of SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh responses to the M, N, and S proteins are shown in Fig 2A. At the
156     first convalescent visit, occurring an average of 23 days post-symptom onset, we detected 6 total
157     pTfh responses in 4 of the 21 individuals tested (19%) and equally spread across each of the
158     three proteins (Fig 2B). These data indicate that only a minority of individuals have mounted
159     detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh responses early in convalescence. However, previous
160     studies on pTfh responses have rarely calculated responder rates, and, therefore, it is difficult to
161     conclude whether this responder frequency is atypical.
                                                                                                                                           7

162               Meanwhile, none of the healthy controls tested had detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh
163     responses. This lack of pTfh responses in COVID negative individuals is not surprising, as pTfh
164     compose a minor population of the total CD4 T cells in the blood and pTfh responses induced by
165     other seasonal coronaviruses, if present, are likely to exist at very low, undetectable frequencies.
166     Additionally, the fact that these responses were only detected in convalescent individuals
167     bolsters our confidence that these pTfh responses were induced by recent SARS-CoV-2 infection
168     and do not represent cross-reactive, memory responses.
169
170     SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh frequencies across the M, N, and S proteins correlate with
171     antibody neutralization.
172               Because pTfh are important for the development of an antibody response, we investigated
173     whether the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh correlated with antibody level and
174     neutralization at the first convalescent visit. We used two measurements of antibodies: The first
175     was the commercially available Abbott test that detects N protein-specific IgG. The second assay
176     measured antibody neutralization by luciferase expression and is likely a more biologically
177     relevant metric because neutralizing antibodies have been shown to correlate with protection in
178     preclinical studies (14, 15). For all three proteins, we see a similar level of significant correlation
179     between the antigen-specific pTfh frequency and N protein IgG titer (Fig 3A). However, we find
180     that pTfh frequencies across proteins differentially correlate with antibody neutralization (Fig 3B):
181     S protein-specific pTfh responses most strongly correlate with nAb (p < 0.0001, r = 0.75), followed
182     by M protein-specific ones (p = 0.001, r = 0.66), and finally N protein-specific pTfh (p = 0.02, r =
183     0.52). To ensure these correlations were specific to SARS-CoV-2-induced responses, we
184     quantified the frequency of total pTfh (CXCR5+PD1+). We did not see any correlation between the
185     overall frequency of pTfh and antibody levels or neutralization (Fig 3C). Taken together, these
                                                                                                                                           8

186     data suggest that pTfh responses across SARS-CoV-2 proteins may contribute to the
187     development of more potent nAbs.
188
189     SARS-CoV-2-specific peripheral T follicular helper responses increase over time in
190     convalescence.
191               To better understand the kinetics of these pTfh responses, we assessed T-cell responses
192     in each of the convalescent individuals at a second, later visit, an average of 38 days post-
193     symptom onset (range: 26-59 days). pTfh response frequencies detected by AIM increased from
194     the first to second convalescent visit, where the overall pTfh responder rate went from 19% (4/21)
195     to 43% (9/21). This increase in responses over time is most obviously observed towards the M
196     protein where the CD4 T-cell response rate increased from 38% to 57% and the pTfh response
197     rate increased from 10% to 33% (Fig 4A). Additionally, M protein-specific CD4 T-cell and pTfh
198     response magnitudes by AIM trended up from the first to second visit (p = 0.09 and p = 0.07,
199     respectively), while other antigen-specific subsets appeared at similar magnitudes at both
200     timepoints (Fig 4B).
201               At the first visit timepoint, there were no pTfh responses with a magnitude higher than 5%
202     frequency. Meanwhile, at the second visit, five such SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh responses were
203     detected in four individuals. For these four individuals, the first visit took place an average of 17
204     days post-symptom onset, and the second visit took place an average of 32.5 days post-symptom
205     onset. In the case of CR21, a robust M protein-specific pTfh response arose over just seven days.
206     These antigen stimulations are shown for both Visit 1 and Visit 2 in Fig 4C, and the number of
207     days between visits is indicated between the top and bottom panels. Of these responses, only
208     one was detected at the first visit (CR11, S protein). These responses suggest that SARS-CoV-
209     2-specific pTfh continue to increase over time during convalescence.

212               In this study, we longitudinally examined the CD4 T-cell responses targeting the major
213     SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, M, N, and S, in 21 convalescent individuals by measuring the
214     expression of activation marker and the production of effector cytokines. We found that at the first
215     convalescent visit, antigen-specific pTfh responses could be detected against all three proteins
216     and that the frequency of antigen-specific pTfh in these individuals correlated with nAb, albeit to
217     varying degrees. We also found that pTfh responses increase over time in convalescence and
218     that truly robust pTfh responses (>5% frequency) were only detected at a second, later visit.
219               The relative weakness of the correlation between N protein-specific pTfh frequency and
220     antibody neutralization compared to the M and S proteins may relate back to the structure of
221     SARS-CoV-2. Both the spike and membrane proteins have portions that are located exteriorly,
222     while the nucleocapsid protein is found exclusively internally. Collectively, these data suggest that
223     pTfh responses induced against different SARS-CoV-2 proteins may not be equally effective in
224     aiding B cells and bolsters the foundation for several vaccine strategies currently in testing which
225     only include the Spike protein. In fact, many of these vaccines have reported levels of antibodies
226     similar to those seen in natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild disease, which may be a result of
227     focusing the pTfh response on the S protein (12, 38). However, as prior studies have shown CD4
228     T cells across different protein specificities may contribute to nAb induction (36, 37), future studies
229     should work to ascertain the level to which M and N protein-specific pTfh responses contribute to
230     the formation of neutralizing antibodies. It is possible that pTfh responses across different protein
231     specificities all play a synergistic role in the development of nAb.
232               Meanwhile, the observed increase in pTfh responses over time suggests that pTfh
233     response formation may be delayed in SARS-CoV-2 infection. A study of influenza vaccination
234     showed that pTfh responses peaked seven days after vaccine administration (25); meanwhile, a
235     longitudinal study of pTfh in dengue virus infection found that the frequency of antigen-specific
236     pTfh decreased from the time of acute infection (22). In comparison with these studies, it appears
237     that pTfh response formation in SARS-Cov-2 infection continues well into convalescence as the
                                                                                                                                         10

238     second visit for all individuals assessed in this study occurred an average of 38 days following
239     symptom onset. A delay in pTfh response formation could be due to the T-cell dysfunction that
240     occurs in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many groups have described significant T-cell dysfunction in
241     acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (4, 5, 39), and our group has recently illustrated that this dysfunction
242     is sustained during convalescence, even in non-hospitalized individuals (6). These high
243     magnitude pTfh responses could also be the result of persistent antigen exposure, as several
244     groups have reported prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR (40, 41). Future studies would
245     ideally delve deeper by examining additional relevant cytokines, like IL4, IL13, and IL21, and
246     combine activation marker and cytokine staining to allow for comprehensive functional analysis
247     of these impressive pTfh responses arising later in convalescence.
248               It is also important to note that not all responses initially detected at the first visit were
249     observed at the second visit, as illustrated by the full CD4 and pTfh response mapping by AIM
250     and ICS (S4A-C Fig). When considering responses detected at either timepoint, 17/21 (81%) of
251     individuals mounted a SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T-cell response by AIM (S4D Fig), and CD4
252     response were detected in 13/21 (62%) of individuals by ICS (S4E Fig). In fact, 43% T-cell
253     responses detected by AIM were found at only one of the two tested timepoints. Even so, the
254     responder frequencies detected at each visit (57% at visit 1 and 62% at visit 2, by AIM) are lower
255     than what other recent studies have published, where SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were
256     detected in 80-100% of individuals tested (8, 10). One reason for this is that we applied a stringent
257     positivity criteria where responses were considered positive when three times over background
258     and significant by fisher’s exact (p value < 0.0001), based on optimization studies conducted by
259     the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (42). For example, for CD4 T cell responses by ICS, our responder
260     frequency at the first visit was 48% (10/21), but if using three times the background, the CD4
                                                                                                                                         11

261     responder rate is 76% (16/21). This strategy likely decreases our false positive rate but may also
262     contribute to the discrepancy between our data and previously published studies.
263               These data further our understanding of CD4 T-cell responses, particularly pTfh
264     responses, against SARS-CoV-2. Our study directly measures SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh
265     responses to three major structural proteins, M, N, and S. We clearly demonstrate that SARS-
266     CoV-2-specific pTfh responses that arise early in convalescence strongly correlate with antibody
267     neutralization and that S protein-specific responses most closely relate to antibody neutralization.
268     But, we also show that pTfh responses against other SARS-CoV-2 proteins correlate with
269     antibody neutralization, indicating a possible role for intrastructural help. Finally, in measuring
270     these responses over time, we observe the emergence of several high magnitude responses
271     more than a month following symptom onset, suggesting that pTfh response formation may be
272     delayed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

274     Methods and Materials
275     Ethics statement: All patients included in this study were adults and recruited from the University
276     of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) HIV care clinic, also known as the 1917 clinic, after obtaining
277     written, informed consent and approval from the IRB-160125005 at UAB.
278     Patient Samples: Cryopreserved PBMC samples for T-cell assays and plasma samples for
279     antibody assays were acquired through the UAB COVID Enterprise Biorepository. All samples
280     were obtained with patient consent under the appropriate IRB guidelines. Patient demographic
281     information is shown in Table 1. Paired Visit 1 and Visit 2 PBMC samples from 21 individuals who
282     had recovered from COVID-19 were assessed in this study. Clinical data from these individuals
283     were retrieved from the Enterprise Biorepository REDCap database (43). All tested individuals
284     were symptomatic, but none were hospitalized during the course of their illness. Symptom severity
285     was quantified using a self-reported severity score on a scale of 1 to 3, where 1 represented no
                                                                                                                                         12

286     interference in daily life, 2 a moderate impact on daily life, and 3 a significant decrease in quality
287     of life due to symptoms. A majority of individuals reported moderate severity (71%, 15/21), and a
288     minority reported mild severity of symptoms (29%, 6/21). None reported severe symptoms.
289     Additionally, all but two had a positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab. The two individuals
290     who did not have a PCR test completed had a known COVID contact, were symptomatic, and
291     had detectable T-cell responses. Clinical data PBMCs from 10 healthy donors (all collected prior
292     to the COVID-19 pandemic) were assessed for T-cell responses in parallel.
293     Peptide pools: Overlapping peptides spanning the SARS-CoV-2 M, N, and S proteins (NCBI
294     reference number MN985325.1) were designed as 20mers overlapping by 10 amino acids which
295     has previously been shown to effectively detect CD4 T-cell responses (44, 45). Peptides were
296     synthesized by New England Peptide in a 96-well plate format.
297     Flow cytometry: For activation-induced marker staining (AIM), cells were thawed and stimulated
298     with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools for each of the M, N, and S proteins. An unstimulated, negative
299     control and an SEB stimulated, positive control were included for each sample. Co-stimulatory
300     anti-CD28 and anti-CD49d were added (BD Pharmingen). After an 18 hour incubation at 37oC,
301     cells were washed with FACS wash (2% FBS in PBS), stained with CCR7- PercpCy5.5 at 37oC
302     for 20 min, washed, and then stained with the following antibodies: CD4-Pe610, CD3-A780, CD8-
303     FITC, CD14-A700, CD19-A700, Ox40-PeCy7, PDL1-PE, CXCR5-BV421, PD1-BV785, CD45RA-
304     BV510, CD137-BV650, CD69-BUV737, and Dead cell dye-UV. Cells were then washed and fixed
305     in 2% formaldehyde. Events were collected on a BD FACSymphony A3 within 24 hours and
306     analyzed using FlowJo software (v10).
307               Intracellular staining (ICS) experiments were set up in parallel with the AIM staining
308     experiments and performed similarly, with a few notable exceptions. CD107a-FITC was added
309     with the co-stimulatory antibody mix; Monensin and Brefeldin A (BD Bioscience) were added after
310     1 hour. Cells were incubated for 12 hours in total, instead of 18. Staining was conducted in three
311     steps: 1) Surface marker staining for 30 min at 4oC with Dead cell dye-UV, CD3-A780, CD4-
                                                                                                                                         13

314     at 4oC with IFNγ-A700, TNFα-PeCy7, and CD154-APC. CD154 was plotted against IFNγ.
315     Additional details regarding the antibodies used in both the AIM and ICS assays can be found in
316     S1 Table, and the gating strategies for AIM and ICS in an unstimulated, negative control are
317     shown in S1 Fig.
318     Antibody assays: Plasma samples from the first time point for all 21 individuals were tested for
319     SARS-CosV-2-specific antibodies. The Abbott Architect assay was used to detect immunoglobin
320     G (IgG) reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (46). The IgG quantity is reported as
321     a calculated index specimen/calibrator ratio, and values over 1.4 were considered positive for N
322     protein IgG. Manufacturer-reported specificity of this assay is 99.6% (99.1%-99.9%).
323               Antibody neutralization assays were conducted as previously described (47). Briefly, the
324     SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Wuhan 1, with a 19 amino acid cytoplasmic tail deletion) was pseudotyped
325     onto an HV-1 nanoluciferase reporter backbone by co-transfection in HEC 293T cells.
326     Pseudovirus was incubated with five-fold serial dilutions of patient plasma and then used to infect
327     1.5x104 293T clone 13 cells expressing ACE2. Two days post-infection, cells were washed with
328     PBS, lysed, and nanoluciferase activity was determined according to manufacturer’s instructions
329     (Nano-Glo® Luciferase Assay System). Luciferase activity in wells with virus and no patient
330     plasma were set to 100%, and the dilution of plasma at which luminescence was reduced to 50%
331     (ID50) was calculated.
332     Statistical analysis: Comparisons between paired visit 1 and visit 2 magnitudes were conducted
333     by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. All correlations were determined by Spearman Rank tests, with
334     the exception of Supplemental Figure 2A, where multiple measurements were plotted for each
335     individual (across the three proteins) and therefore a generalized linear mixed effect model
336     accounting for multiple measurements per individual was employed. In Figure 3, all axes were
                                                                                                                                         14
