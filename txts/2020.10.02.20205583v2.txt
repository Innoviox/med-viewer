     Abstract
     Objective.
     Electroencephalography (EEG) interpretations through visual (by human raters) and
     automated (by computer technology) analysis are still not reliable for the diagnosis of non-
     convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). This study aimed to identify typical pitfalls in the
     EEG analysis and make suggestions as to how those pitfalls might be avoided.
     Methods.
     We analyzed the EEG recordings of individuals who had clinically confirmed or suspected
     NCSE. Epileptiform EEG activity during seizures (ictal discharges) were visually analyzed
     by two independent raters. We investigated whether unreliable EEG visual interpretations
     quantified by low inter-rater agreement can be predicted by the characteristics of ictal
     discharges and individuals’ clinical data. In addition, the EEG recordings were
     automatically analyzed by in-house algorithms. To further explore the causes of unreliable
     EEG interpretations, two epileptologists analyzed EEG patterns most likely misinterpreted
     as ictal discharges based on the differences between the EEG interpretations through the
     visual and automated analysis.

     Results.
     Short ictal discharges with a gradual onset (developing over 3 seconds in length) were
     liable to be misinterpreted. An extra 2 minutes of ictal discharges contributed to an increase
     in the kappa statistics of > 0.1. Other problems were the misinterpretation of abnormal
     background activity (slow wave activities, other abnormal brain activity, and the ictal-like
     movement artifacts), continuous interictal discharges, and continuous short ictal discharges.
     Conclusion.
     A longer duration criterion for NCSE-EEGs than 10 seconds that commonly used in NCSE
     working criteria is needed. Using knowledge of historical EEGs, individualized algorithms,
     and context-dependent alarm thresholds may also avoid the pitfalls.

 1.         Introduction
 Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is characterized by its inconspicuous motor signs with
 prolonged electrographic seizure activities 1. Given the subtle and variable clinical presentations,
 electroencephalography (EEG) that confirms ictal discharges (epileptiform EEG activity during a
 seizure) is an essential diagnostic tool of NCSE. The reliability of the diagnostic tool can be
 assessed by the interrater agreement of visual EEG interpretation 2. A low agreement could indicate
 the presence of certain EEG misinterpretations and therefore less reliable diagnosis of NCSE 3.
 Currently, NCSE-EEG interpretations through visual analysis by human raters and automated
 analysis by computer technology are still not very reliable 4–10. The Salzburg Consensus Criteria
 (SCC) 11,12 achieved a reasonably high accuracy and inter-rater agreement among human raters for
 the diagnosis of NCSE 13,14. However, the accuracy and agreement are relatively low when human
 raters cannot assess the effect of intravenous antiepileptic drugs on the EEG of individuals during
 NCSE and when raters interpret short EEG recordings 5,15,16. The visual EEG interpretation relies
 heavily on subjective judgments based on human raters’ experience and knowledge about the
 characteristics of ictal discharges such as location, morphology, frequency, and persistence. EEG-
 readers who are inexperienced for NCSE-EEG patterns are more liable to misinterpret EEG, which
                                                                                   10
 results in an unreliable NCSE diagnosis. A previous study                             summarized several pitfalls in the
 EEG interpretations of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with NCSE, including misinterpreting
 artifacts as ictal discharges, assuming that the stereotypical patterns of ictal discharges are
 observed on the same subject, and assuming that a dichotomy exists between ictal and interictal
 discharges (epileptiform EEG activity between seizures) in patients with encephalopathy. On the
                                                                                                                                   5

 other hand, automated EEG analysis can assist clinicians and care-givers in the detection of ictal
 discharges because of its greater time efficiency and more objective judgments than visual analysis
 6–9
     . However, pitfalls of EEG misinterpretations (misclassifications) also exist in automated
              8,9
 analysis         : the misclassification of pre-ictal discharges (epileptiform EEG activity before a
 seizure), post-ictal discharges (epileptiform EEG activity after a seizure), high-frequency artifacts,
 or similar background EEG activity. These misinterpretations of EEG by both human raters and
 computer technology could lead to wrong diagnoses of NCSE and cause serious consequences 17,18.
 EEG-readers need to be alert to potential pitfalls in EEG analysis for reliable NCSE diagnosis.
 Nevertheless, studies on the pitfalls in the visual and automated EEG analysis for NCSE are
                            4,10
 relatively scarce               . This research therefore addresses the pitfalls of unreliable EEG
 interpretations in the visual and automated EEG analysis for NCSE patients with chronic epilepsy
 and brain development disorders. We explored whether the reliability of EEG interpretation can
 be predicted by the characteristics of ictal discharges and the clinical data of patients. Moreover,
 we further identified potential pitfalls which could cause EEG misinterpretations and therefore low
 reliability in the NCSE diagnosis. Strategies to avoid the pitfalls were also proposed in this study.
 2.         Materials and methods
 2.1.       Study design
 This is a retrospective explorative study approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of
 Kempenhaeghe in the Netherlands. We retrieved and analyzed the EEG and the clinical records of
 30 subjects with preceding seizures between 2008 and 2016 in this study. Twenty of the 30 subjects’
                                                                                                                                   6

 data were recorded when they had clinically confirmed NCSE, which was diagnosed based on the
 clinical information, such as clinical signs, response to treatment, and EEG recordings. The other
 ten subjects’ data were recorded during clinically suspected NCSE, that is, the subjects were first
 suspected to have NCSE based on clinical signs, but the suspicion was disconfirmed based on the
 response to treatment and EEG recordings. We included subjects < 65 years and excluded EEG
 recordings with excessive artifacts and those of subjects from whom we did not receive permission
 (from themselves and/or their legal guardians) to use their recordings for scientific research.
 The study had three phases. (1) Subjects’ data were screened according to the inclusion and
 exclusion criteria, and the clinical background was evaluated by an experienced epileptologist. (2)
 Ictal discharges in the EEG recordings were annotated by two independent raters. (3) Pitfalls in
 the visual and automated EEG analysis were investigated.
 2.2.       Data sources
 The EEG recordings were acquired by three different systems (BrainRT equipment from
 Onafhankelijke Software Groep, EEG Stellate from Natus Europe GmbH, and Micromed from
 SIGMA Medizin-Technik GmbH) at Kempenhaeghe. The sampling rate of the EEG recordings
 was 100 Hz, 200 Hz, or 256Hz. EEG electrodes were positioned in the 10-20 system. For the
 algorithm development of the automated EEG analysis, 21 electrodes were used (19 electrodes in
 the 10-20 system, plus electrodes F9 and F10). All recordings were continuous except in nine
 subjects, where 5 minutes per hour were stored when no clinical abnormalities were recorded.
 From each subject’s clinical data and the corresponding clinical report of EEG recordings, we

 collected information about age, sex, intellectual disability level, sleep status, preexisting epileptic
 encephalopathy (defined as severe brain dysfunction at early age), clinical signs during NCSE, and
 seizure history.
 2.3.       EEG visual analysis and inter-rater agreement
 The raters were asked to focus on the EEG visual analysis without checking corresponding videos,
 as NCSE is known by its difficult discrimination from normal behavior, and the fact that different
 patients show variable clinical presentations. Annotations of ictal discharges were made with the
 assist of the open-source software “EDFbrowser” 19. Four types of EEG montages were available
 during the visual analysis, including longitudinal bipolar montage, transverse bipolar montage,
 average montage, and original archived data montage.
 The raters annotated ictal discharges and labeled their characteristics: duration, certainty, onset
 location, onset visibility, and morphology patterns according to the pre-defined criteria shown in
 table 1. As NCSE takes a relatively long time to develop and disappear, we set a minimum of 20
 seconds as the duration criterion for the EEG pattern. The presence of ictal discharges was
 primarily assessed according to the combination of both SCC and the American Clinical
 Neurophysiology Society's Standardized Critical Care EEG Terminology (ACNS) criteria 11,12,20.
 The raters categorized the certainty of their annotations as either definite or possible ictal
 discharges, and the rest of the recordings was categorized as episodes without ictal discharges. In
 addition, the ictal discharges were labeled either generalized or focal according to their onset
 location, and their onset visibility were labeled either sudden or gradual according to the ACNS
                                                                                                                                   8

 We summarized the annotated ictal discharges by the two raters via an annotation code (appendix
 A), and estimated the inter-rater agreement. Cohen’s kappa was calculated to assess the agreement
 on episodes with and without ictal discharges. Fleiss’ kappa was estimated to assess the agreement
 on episodes with definite ictal discharges, with possible ictal discharges, and without ictal
 discharges. The 95% confidence interval (CI) of the kappa statistics were also calculated. The level
 of the agreement was interpreted according to the suggestions of Landis and Koch 22.
 2.4.       Investigation of unreliable EEG interpretations through visual analysis
 We applied linear regression models to determine whether the reliability of EEG interpretations,
 quantified by the inter-rater agreement, was influenced by the characteristics of ictal discharges
 and the clinical data of subjects. Two models with Cohen’s kappa and Fleiss’ kappa as the
 dependent variables were fitted. The independent variables were the characteristics of ictal
 discharges (duration, certainty, onset location, onset visibility, and morphology patterns) and the
 clinical data (age, sex, intellectual disability level, sleep status, preexisting epileptic
 encephalopathy, clinical signs during NCSE, and seizure history). The analysis was implemented
 in SPSS Statistics version 25. A two-tailed p-value < 0.05 indicated a significant linear relationship.
 2.5.       Analysis of EEG misinterpretations through visual and automated analysis
 Comparing the EEG interpretations from visual and automated analysis can help us point out the

 interface shown in figure 1) that presents the EEG recordings, the annotated ictal discharges by
 raters, and the EEG signal classification results generated by our in-house automated analysis

 system. The automated analysis system included pre-processing, feature extraction, and synthetic
 three-class classification (more details can be found in appendix B). The system mainly analyzed
 features in time-frequency domain and built a synthetic three-class classifier to classify EEG
 epochs into three categories: ictal discharges, suspicious activity, and normal activity. The
 suspicious activity indicated the misinterpreted EEG signals (signals misclassified as ictal
 discharges) in the automated analysis. In the lower panel of the multimodal viewer (figure 1), the
 distribution of the three categories were presented in units of 10 seconds.
 Two epileptologists investigated and discussed the pitfalls of EEG misinterpretations for each
 subject. They used the multimodal viewer to compare the EEG interpretations through the visual
 and automated analysis. Meanwhile, they checked the corresponding clinical data and inter-rater
 agreement. The pitfalls of EEG misinterpretations in the automated analysis were investigated
 among the EEG episodes without annotated ictal discharges but automatically classified as definite
 or suspected ictal discharges. The pitfalls of EEG misinterpretations in the visual analysis were
 investigated among the EEG episodes with annotated ictal discharges but automatically classified
 as normal activity

 3.         Results
 3.1.       Subjects
 The subject flow through the three study phases is shown in a recruitment tree (figure 2). In the
 first phase, two subjects were excluded, and two were moved from the diagnosed NCSE group to
 the suspected NCSE group. In the second phase, the EEG recordings of two subjects in the NCSE
 group and nine subjects in the suspected NCSE group did not include any agreed annotated ictal
 discharges. All 16 subjects in the NCSE group were included in the third phase for the statistical
 analysis. Fourteen of the 16 subjects were used in the automated EEG analysis system development.
 In addition, two, nine, and five of the 16 subjects’ EEG recordings in the NCSE group were
 sampled at 100 Hz, 200 Hz, and 256 Hz, respectively. In the suspected NCSE group, one subject’s
 recording was sampled at 200 Hz, and the others were at 256 Hz.

 In the first phase, the median age of the 16 NCSE subjects was 21 years, ranging from 6 to 43
 years, and the median age of the 12 suspected NCSE subjects was 19 years, ranging from 4 to 61
 years. Figure 3 presents an overview of the demographics and the clinical characteristics of the
 subjects. Of note, two of 16 NCSE subjects had preexisting epileptic encephalopathy, whereas in
 the suspected NCSE group, the subjects with and without preexisting epileptic encephalopathy
 were equally distributed. Moreover, the EEG recording duration in the suspected NCSE group is
 generally shorter than that in the NCSE group. A more comprehensive list of the clinical signs,
 seizure histories, and other characteristics of individual NCSE and suspected NCSE subjects are
 provided in appendix C.

 3.2.       Inter-rater agreement of visual EEG interpretations
 In the NCSE group, the inter-rater agreement for both two categories (episodes with ictal
 discharges and without ictal discharges) and three categories (episodes with possible ictal
 discharges, with definite ictal discharges, and without ictal discharges) was moderate, with
 Cohen’s kappa = 0.53 and 95% CI [0.37, 0.69], and Fleiss’ kappa = 0.41 and 95% CI [0.25, 0.57],
 respectively. The inter-rater agreement of the individual subjects are shown in appendix D. In the
 suspected NCSE group, the inter-rater agreement was poor (Cohen’s kappa = 0; Fleiss’ kappa = -
 0.08); hence, we did not further analyze the EEG recordings in this group.
 3.3.       Annotated ictal discharges in the NCSE group
 In the NCSE group, 338 ictal discharges were annotated among approximately 183 hours of EEG
 recordings. The annotated ictal discharges lasted approximately 14.7 hours in total. The ictal
 discharges were summarized (figure 4) according to their characteristics: the certainty, onset
 location, onset visibility, and morphology patterns. The definite and possible ictal discharges each
 accounted for similar proportions. With respect to the onset location, generalized ictal discharges
 reached major proportions. In addition, the ictal discharges with a sudden onset, developing from
 absent in less than or equal to 3 seconds, accounted for a slightly higher proportion than the ictal
 discharges with a gradual onset, developing from absent in more than 3 seconds. Morphologically,
 the vast majority (66%) of the ictal discharges had a “Spike Wave” pattern.

 3.4.       Pitfalls of unreliable EEG interpretations through visual EEG analysis
 Linear models showed a significant relationship between the average duration of the ictal
 discharges with a gradual onset and inter-rater agreement measured by the kappa statistics. For
 Cohen’s kappa, β=0.001, F(1, 14) = 10.861, p = 0.005, and the independent variable (the average
 duration) explained 43.7% of the variability. For Fleiss’s kappa, β=0.001, F(1, 14) = 12.89, p =
 0.003, and the independent variable explained 44.2% of the variability. In other words, an extra 2
 minutes of the ictal discharges with a gradual onset contributed to an increase in the kappa statistics
 of > 0.1. This implies that human raters interpreted ictal discharges with a gradual onset less
 reliably when the duration was shorter. Using a short duration criterion in annotating these ictal
 discharges could be a pitfall in visual EEG analysis (table 2).

 The abnormal background activity was categorized in three types: slow wave activities (figure 5A)
 regularly observed in a dysfunctional brain or in a drowsy stage, other abnormal brain activity
 (figure 5B) whose appearance was subject-dependent, and ictal-discharge-like movement artifacts
 caused by rhythmic movements, such as repetitive chewing movements (figure 5C). The pitfalls
 of misinterpretations are summarized in table 2, and the remarks by the epileptologists are
 provided in appendix E.
 4.         Discussion
 A reliable and correct EEG interpretation to diagnose NCSE is currently still difficult from visual
                                              5,18,23
 as well as automated analysis                        . In this retrospective study, we visually and automatically
 analyzed NCSE-EEG recordings, and the inter-rater agreement in the NCSE group was moderate
 (Cohen’s kappa = 0.53 and Fleiss’ kappa = 0.41), consistent with the findings by Goselink et al. 5.
 We found that using a short duration criterion for ictal discharges with a gradual onset contributed
 to an unreliable EEG interpretation. Moreover, we pointed out other facts for EEG
 misinterpretation: abnormal background activity, continuous interictal discharges, and continuous
 short ictal discharges, which extended the findings of a previous study 10.
 One pitfall was to use a short ictal duration criterion for ictal discharges with a gradual onset. In
 this study, we set 20 seconds as the duration criterion for ictal discharges, but even then the inter-
 rater agreement was still low. The 10-second criterion in SCC 12, defined according to commonly
 used EEG reading duration via software, could be too short to support the reliability of visual EEG
 interpretations in clinical practice. To increase the reliability of NCSE diagnosis and conform to
                                                                                                                                 19

 the natural course of the disease, a longer duration criterion can be recommended in future,
 especially when EEG-readers rate ictal discharges with a gradual onset. However, using a too long
 duration criterion might increase the risk of ignoring intervals carrying essential information.
 Further research should be undertaken into optimal length. Until now, automated EEG analysis
 algorithms for NCSE have regularly used short (e.g., 3 seconds) EEG signals as a classification
 epoch, but the epoch duration is too short to be used in reliably detecting the ictal discharges for
 NCSE diagnosis according to the earlier discussion. To be consistent with the way clinicians
 diagnose NCSE, future studies about automated EEG analysis algorithms should focus on ictal
 discharge detection using longer-duration EEG epochs.
 The pitfalls of EEG misinterpretations in both visual and automated analysis were misinterpreting
 the following as ictal discharges: (1) abnormal background activity [(a) slow wave activities, (b)
 other abnormal brain activity, and (c) the ictal-like movement artifacts], (2) continuous interictal
 discharges, and (3) continuous short ictal discharges.
 (1) For the three types of activities of the abnormal background activity:
            (a) Slow wave activities are frequently observed in a damaged brain (e.g., in epileptic
 encephalopathies) or during drowsiness. In visual analysis, EEG readers with insufficient training
                                                                                                                            18
 in reading EEGs from a dysfunctional brain or sleep-EEG may misinterpret the EEG                                              . In
 automated analysis, slow wave activities and ictal discharges could be confused because their
 frequency bands are similar. An advanced signal processing technique, such as extracting features
                                                                                               24
 in the morphological besides the time-frequency domain features                                  , may be helpful in their
 distinction in future studies.

            (b) The other abnormal brain activity is individually variable, and can be avoided by the
 use of historical EEG data. Its misinterpretation (false alarms) in automated analysis was also
 mentioned in the previous studies 8,9.
            (c) The ictal-like movement artifacts could be misinterpreted in automated analysis when
 their repetitive movements have a similar frequency band as ictal discharges. The low-pass filter
 of the analysis algorithms helps filter out high-frequency components caused by muscle activities,
 but keeps the envelope of signals caused by the repetitive movements.
 In summary, to avoid misinterpretation of abnormal background activity, we suggest reading more
 EEG recordings from the same subject to help human raters better recognize subject-specific ictal
 discharges and individualizing automated analysis algorithms.

 duration and presence of repetitive spiking or bursting activity cannot be the only criteria to

 identify interictal discharges by EEG readers                       . Further investigation of criteria for interictal
 discharges is needed.
 (3) High concentrations of short ictal discharges can be observed in the EEG recording of a subject
 presenting many short and unstable epileptic activities. Raters with hyper-sensitivity may
 misinterpret them as ictal discharges. We would suggest that EEG readers carefully interpret such
 EEG recordings and consult other readers if in doubt. In addition, we recommend tuning alarm
 thresholds according to subject-dependent clinical practice in the automated EEG analysis for
 these particular recordings.

 One unanticipated finding is that the inter-rater agreement in the suspected NCSE group was poor.
 Based on our previous discussions and the clinical data of the suspected NCSE subjects, we could
 assume that two factors may explain the unreliable EEG interpretations in this group. (1) Almost
 all the recordings were less than 1 hour, and the raters may not have had enough EEG recordings
 from the same subject to correctly distinguish ictal discharges from the abnormal background
 activity. (2) Half of the subjects had preexisting epileptic encephalopathy. The slow wave activities
 and the interictal discharges in the subjects with encephalopathy were probably misinterpreted as
 ictal discharges. Additional studies are needed to confirm the causes of the poor inter-rater
 agreement in the EEG interpretations of patients with suspected NCSE.
 This study has several limitations. Given that the number of recordings from patients with NCSE
 at Kempenhaeghe is relatively small, we also included several discontinuous archived EEG
 recordings. These discontinuous recordings may hinder human readers and automatic algorithms
 from correctly interpreting EEG. Continuous recordings from more data sources should be used in
 future. The EEG-recordings were acquired by three systems, and their sampling rate were different
 [the lowest sampling rate was 100 Hz (n=2)]. The heterogeneity of the sampling rate was not
 expected to affect our results, such as the problem of the aliasing, because the frequency band of
 interest, such as the frequency range occupied by Spike Wave and Wave patterns, is much lower
 than 50 Hz. Nevertheless, future works should be undertaken to further confirm the influence of
 the different system hardware and setting-up on our results. Given that this is an explorative study,
 the number of recruited subjects (n = 30), EEG readers (n = 2), and research centers (n = 1) was
 small; hence, the generalization of the conclusions is limited. In addition, given that our study is
 explorative and a large population of patient requires a large sample size, the subjects included in
                                                                                                                                 22

 this study were outpatients with chronic seizures and brain development disorders, and their age
 ranged between 4 and 61 years; thus, the conclusions do not extend beyond this population. Future
 work should include more subjects, especially those of neonatal age, elderly patients, patients
 without preexisting epilepsy, and ICU patients, and more EEG readers from different research
 centers for the generalizability. In the development of the automated EEG analysis algorithm, we
 primarily used time-frequency domain features, which limited our conclusion of the pitfalls in the
 automated analysis. In future, morphological features should be added to the automated analysis.
 5.         Conclusion
 We visually and automatically analyzed NCSE-EEG recordings to explore the causes of EEG
 misinterpretations. To avoid the pitfalls in NCSE-EEG analysis, a longer duration criterion than
 the one suggested by the Salzburg criteria is needed. Using knowledge of historical EEGs,
 individualized algorithms, and context-dependent alarm thresholds may also avoid mistakes.
