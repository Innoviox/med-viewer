   Abstract
   Background
   During the current COVID-19 pandemic many countries have taken drastic measures to
   reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These often include decreasing the number of
   contacts by physical distancing.
   Aim
   To measure the actual reduction of contacts when physical distancing measures are
   implemented.

   In the Netherlands, a cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2016/2017 in which
   participants reported the number and age of their contacts during the previous day. The
   survey was repeated among a subsample of the participants in April 2020 after physical
   distancing measures had been implemented, and in an extended sample in June 2020 after
   some of these measures were relaxed.
   Results
   The average number of community contacts per day was reduced from on average 14.9
   (interquartile range: 4-20) in the 2016/2017 survey to 3.5 (0-4) after physical distancing
   measures were implemented, and rebounded to 8.8 (1-10) after some of these measures
   were relaxed. All age groups restricted their number of community contacts to at most 5
   contacts on average after physical distancing measures were implemented. After relaxation,
   children reverted to baseline levels while elderly had a number of community contacts that
   was less than half their baseline levels.
   Conclusion
   The physical distancing measures have greatly reduced contact numbers, which has likely
   been beneficial in curbing the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands.
   Different age groups reacted differently upon relaxation of these measures. These findings
   offer guidance for the deployment of age-targeted measures in the future course of the
   pandemic.

   Introduction
   Since the beginning of 2020, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19
   disease has rapidly spread around the world. Most patients experience mild symptoms, but
   in particular elderly and persons with comorbidities may develop severe acute respiratory
   disease [1]. Hospitals have been confronted with an alarmingly growing number of patients,
   often exceeding the intensive care (IC) capacity. Many countries have implemented control
   measures that include a combination of increased hygiene, travel restrictions, case finding,
   contact tracing and physical distancing measures. The specific physical distancing measures
   differ between countries and between regions; their overall aim is to reduce the number of
   contacts in the population thus preventing the transmission of infection. The impact of
   these measures on the reduction of contacts in the population, and the reduction of
   contacts made by different age groups within that population, are poorly quantified.
   Different approaches exist to measure behavioural changes. Mobile telephone data
   provided by telecom companies are used to measure the change in mobility patterns [2, 3].
   Similarly, the location history of smart phones can be tracked with apps [4]. The anonymised
   and aggregated mobility patterns can suggest changes in contact patterns in the population
   at large. To obtain direct and detailed information on contacts, cross-sectional studies are
   conducted in which participants report their age and sex as well as the age and sex of all
   persons they have contacted during a single day [5, 6]. In the first months of the COVID-19
   pandemic, contact surveys have been successfully used to quantify the reduction in the
   number of contacts associated with physical distancing measures in Shanghai and Wuhan,
   China, estimated at 88% and 86%, respectively [7], and in the UK among the adult
   population, at 74% [8]. One of the challenges with the contact survey approach is to obtain
   a reliable baseline measurement before physical distancing measures were implemented. In
   the Wuhan study, participants needed to recall the number of contacts during a regular
   weekday at the end of 2019. In the UK study the baseline was provided by a similar study
   conducted 13 years ago among a different representative UK study population [5].
   We present two large contact surveys conducted in the Netherlands, in April 2020 and in
   June 2020. The participants were recruited from a large nationwide sample of the Dutch
   population who had participated in an earlier cross-sectional survey in 2016/2017 [9],
   supplemented with a new nationwide sample of the Dutch population for the June 2020
                                                                   4

   survey. The contact questionnaire was nearly identical in all surveys, which allows us to use
   the first survey as a baseline measurement. By 16 March 2020, the Netherlands had
   imposed physical distancing measures including closing daycare centers, schools,
   universities; working from home whenever possible; closing of cafes, pubs, restaurants,
   theaters, cinemas, and sport clubs; cancelling events with more than 10 persons attending;
   and maintaining 1.5 m distance from others outside one's household. A few weeks after
   these measures were implemented, the first survey was conducted. By 1 June 2020, most of
   the physical distancing measures were somewhat relaxed, except for working from home,
   and keeping 1.5 m distance. Primary schools and daycare centers were open at full capacity,
   and secondary schools, cafes, pubs, restaurants, theaters and cinemas at a reduced
   capacity. A few weeks after this relaxation, the second survey was conducted.
   By comparing the survey results before and after implementing the physical distancing
   measures, we could determine the impact on the number of contacts made in the
   community (i.e. outside the household), distinguishing between different age groups, sexes,
   household sizes, and days of the week. We also assessed how the physical distancing
   measures have affected the total number of contacts, including contacts with household
   members, and the age-specific mixing patterns.
   Methods
   Between February 2016 and October 2017, a cross-sectional sero-epidemiological study was
   conducted in a sample of the Dutch population from 0 to 89 years of age [9], henceforth
   referred to as ‘the baseline survey’. Participants were randomly selected from the Dutch
   population registry using a two-stage cluster design. Infants under 1 year of age, persons
   living in areas with low vaccination coverage, and persons with a migration background
   were oversampled in this survey. The study consisted of an extensive questionnaire, that
   was filled out by the guardians or parents for participants under 15 years of age. It included
   questions regarding the participants' age and sex, the age and sex of their household
   members, and the total number of unique persons they had contacted outside their
   household the previous day and which day of the week (i.e., Monday through Sunday) this
   applied to. Participants reported the age of the contacted persons in 11 age groups (0-4, 5-
                                                                   5

   9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, 90+). In the questionnaire,
   examples of a contact are given as talking to someone (face-to-face), touching someone,
   kissing someone or doing sports with someone.
   Of the 8,179 participants that had filled out the questionnaire in 2016/2017, 6102 were
   invited on 26 March 2020 to participate in the follow-up study, referred to as ‘the April 2020
   survey’. In total, 3,168 questionnaires were returned. Of these participants 2,754 again
   participated in the final survey, referred to as ‘the June 2020 survey’. They were
   supplemented with 4,496 new participants from a large population-based sample of 27,053
   randomly drawn Dutch citizens across all municipalities of the country. These bring the total
   number of participants for the June 2020 survey to 7,250.
   In order to obtain a representative study population, we omitted the participants from the
   low vaccination coverage areas that were oversampled, and we omitted the oversampled
   infants under 1 year of age in the baseline survey, such that the fraction of infants in the
   study population reflected the fraction of infants in the 2017 Dutch population. We
   excluded participants that did not fill out certain questions: participants that did not report
   the household composition and participants that did not report any contacts while also
   omitting the contact day. Finally, participants reporting more than 100 contacts per day
   were excluded from the analysis, as it was deemed unrealistic to have more face-to-face
   conversations during one day.
   The questionnaire in the 2020 surveys was identical to the baseline survey questionnaire,
   apart from two questions. A question asking whether participants had had any contacts
   outside their household was added (before asking how many), and in the June 2020 survey a
   question was added how many contacts in each age group occurred within 1.5 m or outside
   1.5 m distance.
   We analysed the contact surveys by comparing the number of contacts in the community
   per participant stratified by several characteristics: age, sex, household size, and day of the
   week. We combined the two oldest age groups and used 10 age groups (up to 80+) for the
   analysis. For the June 2020 survey, we studied the fraction of close contacts (within 1.5 m)
   by age group. We restricted this part of the analysis to community contacts, i.e. contacts
                                                                   6

   made with non-household members, because contacts with household members were not
   reported.
   For the following part of the analysis we used the household composition as a proxy for
   household contacts. By adding these to the reported community contacts, we obtained the
   total number of contacts in the population. We estimated age-stratified contact matrices
   that contain the number of contacts made between and within age groups, using an
   approach that accounts for reciprocity of contacts between different age groups [10], and
   using age-specific population size data for the Netherlands on 1 January 2017 and on 1
   January 2019 [11]. To check the effect of enforcing reciprocity between contacts, we
   compared the estimated and observed mean number of contacts per participant. We
   characterised the mixing pattern of the age-specific contacts by the disassortativeness index
   [12], which indicates assortative mixing for values of 0 and random mixing for values of 1.
   We characterised the ‘effective number’ of age-specific contacts by the largest eigenvalue of
   the contact matrix [13]. All analyses were done using R version 3.6.0 [14].

   Results
   Characteristics of the study population
   In total 5066 participants of the baseline survey, 2069 participants of the April 2020 survey,
   and 6300 participants of the June 2020 survey were included for analysis. The composition
   of the survey population by age and sex should reflect the Dutch population (Fig. 1), but the
   older age groups were overrepresented in the 2020 surveys. The mean age was 37 years
   (range 0 – 88) in the baseline survey, 42 years (range 3 – 90) in the April 2020 survey, and 46
   (range 1 – 90) in the June 2020 survey, whereas the mean age of the Dutch population is 41
   years. In all surveys, each age group consisted of more than 100 participants, except for the
   80+ age group in the baseline survey, and the 0-4 and 80+ age groups in the April 2020
   survey (Tab. 1). As expected from the household size distribution in the Netherlands [15],
   participants lived mostly in 2-person households, followed by 4-person households.
   Although the April 2020 survey population contained relatively few single-person
   households, the reported average household size was similar across all surveys (2.8 for the
   baseline survey, 3.0 for the April 2020 survey, 2.9 for the June 2020 survey), and in line with
   the expected average household size of 2.8. There were at least 79 participants per contact
   day of the week for each survey.

   Reduction in the mean number of community contacts
   The percentage of participants who did not report any community contacts on a single day
   increased from 5% in the baseline survey to 42% in the April 2020 survey, and decreased
   again to 22% in the June 2020 survey. The average number of community contacts a
   participant reported per day, decreased from 14.9 (4 – 20, interquartile range or IQR) in the
   baseline survey to 3.5 (0 – 4) in the April 2020 survey, and rebounded to 8.8 (1 – 10) in the
   June 2020 survey (Tab. 2). Compared to the baseline survey, the number of community
   contacts reduced by 76% and 41% in the April 2020 and June 2020 surveys respectively.

   In the baseline survey, participants aged 10 to 19 years had the highest number of
   community contacts, and this number gradually declined with increasing age. In contrast,
   the number of community contacts was more similar across the different age categories in
   the April 2020 survey with middle-aged participants (30-59 age groups) reporting the
   highest numbers of contacts (Fig. 2). The reduction in the number of contacts was with 90%
   greatest for participants aged 5 to 9 years, and with 64% lowest for participants aged 50 to
   59 (Tab. 2). After measures were relaxed, contact numbers increased among all age groups.
   Compared to the baseline survey, the two oldest age groups still reduced their contacts by
   65% and 59%, but the two youngest age groups increased the number of contacts by 30%
   and 23%.
   The reduction in the mean number of contacts was similar for male and female participants.
   The number of community contacts increased with household size in the baseline survey,
   whereas this number was similar for the different household sizes in the April 2020 survey.
   In the June 2020 survey, the number of community contacts increased for all household
   sizes, albeit to a lesser extent in 1- and 2-person households. This is likely caused by elderly
   persons who primarily live in smaller households (see S1.1). In the baseline survey, most
   contacts were made during weekdays, and fewer in the weekends. This distinction largely
   disappeared during the physical distancing measures, and reappeared after measures were
   relaxed.
   In the last contact survey, a question was included whether contacts occurred within or
   outside 1.5 m distance. On average, 53% of the community contacts per participant were
   reported within 1.5 m, ranging from 44% for the 70-79 age group to 77% for the 0-4 age
   group (Fig. 3). These close contacts outside the household occur mainly between children
   themselves, and between 0-4 year-olds and 50-79 year-olds (see S1.2).
   Comparison of mixing patterns
   In estimating the contact rates between age groups, reciprocity between contacts was
   explicitly taken into account. The observed (points) and estimated (line) mean numbers of
   community contacts per participant are in agreement (Fig. 2), showing consistency in
   reporting contacts between the age groups.
                                                                   12

   The contact matrices for all contact surveys and contact types are shown in Fig. 4. The
   contact matrices for household members illustrate that participants generally live with
   persons in their own age group and with their children or parents (i.e. 30 years younger or
   older); this is apparent in all surveys as the household composition remains fairly constant
   over time. The matrices for contacts in the community indicate the younger age groups have
   fewer contacts with all other age groups in the April 2020 survey compared with the
   baseline survey. Most community contacts are made among the working age classes and
   between elderly (80+) and middle-aged adults who might be health care workers or
   informal care givers. In the June 2020 survey, the community contact pattern is restored to
   the baseline pattern, but the absolute values of the contact numbers are smaller.
   Taken together, the household and community contact patterns reveal that age-specific
   mixing did not change much between the baseline and the April 2020 surveys
   (disassortativeness index is 0.50 for the baseline survey, 0.52 for the April 2020 survey). For
   the June 2020 survey however, the disassortativeness index is 0.66, indicating that mixing
   shifted slightly from within same age groups to between different age groups. The effect
   would be that a virus would spread more easily in the population. This is reflected in the
   effective number of contacts per person (i.e. the largest eigenvalue of the contact matrix),
   which decreased from 18 (15 – 24, 95% credible interval) in the baseline survey to 5.6 (4.7 –
   6.5) in the April 2020 survey, an average reduction of 69% (58% – 77%), and reverted to 18
   (14 – 27) the June 2020 survey.

   Discussion
   In the Netherlands, physical distancing measures came into effect on 16 March 2020. Three
   weeks after implementation, the numbers of occupied hospital and IC beds reached a peak,
   after which they gradually declined, reaching a minimum by June 2020 when most measures
   had been relaxed to some degree. Through comparison with the baseline survey, the
   numbers of contacts in the community were reduced by 76% by the physical distancing
   measures, and by 41% after relaxing the measures.
   The sampling scheme for inviting participants from the Dutch population was designed to
   obtain a representative study population. To assess the representativeness of the survey
   participants, a few potential limitations need to be addressed. First, not all of those who
   were invited to the survey, participated, causing a potential for selection bias. Second, there
   are differences in participant characteristics between the surveys, for instance participant
   age, sex, household size and contact day. We determined the weighted average number of
   contacts to account for these differences (see S1.3), and found that only the participant age
   altered the unweighted averages by about 10%. This does not affect the results as they are
   all stratified by age. Third, the 2020 surveys were carried out in time windows of one month
   (April and June), whereas the baseline survey was conducted over a period of almost two
   years. Because contact patterns change little throughout the course of a year (see S1.4 and
   [16]), we do not expect this to substantially affect the estimated reduction. Finally, the
   surveys consisted of different but overlapping study populations. To check whether this had
   any effects on the results, we repeated the analysis on 1,739 participants that were
   common to all surveys. This longitudinal study showed that – although baseline levels were
   a bit higher – trends and reductions were similar to the main analysis (see S1.5).
   During strict physical distancing, the number of community contacts was drastically reduced
   in all age groups. When these measures were relaxed, elderly persons largely kept their
   contacts at a reduced level, while children under 10 years of age had a number of contacts
   similar to before the measures were implemented. Moreover, the majority of these
   contacts occurred occurred within 1.5 m, whereas in the rest of the population around half
   of the contacts were made in close range. On the population level, children under 10 years
   of age accounted for 23% of all contacts (compared to 13% in the baseline survey) but only
                                                                   14

   for less than 1% of the reported infections [17]. This confirms the minor role that children
   play in the epidemic, as is also found in age-specific seroprevalence studies [18-20].
   The reduction in the number of contacts associated with physical distancing measures in the
   Netherlands is smaller than the reductions of 88% and 86% observed in Shanghai and
   Wuhan, China [7], most probably because the measures in the Netherlands were less
   stringent than those in both Chinese cities. In the UK a 74% reduction in the number of all
   contacts among adults (18+) has been reported [8]. To compare this with our results, we
   calculated the total number of contacts including community and household contacts for
   the participants of 18 years and older in our surveys, and found a reduction of 72%. At the
   time of the studies the control measures in the UK and the Netherlands ranked at similar
   values of the stringency index [21], which seems to have led to a similar contact reduction.
   Compared to the baseline, the effective number of contacts per person was found to be
   reduced by 69% in the April 2020 survey and by 0% in the June 2020 survey. This number
   would be proportional to the reproduction number (i.e. the number of secondary infections
   caused by a single infectious person in the population) under three conditions. First, the
   definition of contact (having a face-to-face conversation or physical contact) is a good proxy
   measure for at-risk contact events where SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted. This condition is
   likely met as the virus transmits through similar routes as influenza virus, i.e. droplets,
   fomites, aerosols and contaminated surfaces, for which this is a validated approach [22].
   Second, contacts should have been made in a similar fashion in the different surveys.
   Conversational contacts during the pandemic may very well have taken place at a larger
   distance or with a face mask. This would mean that the reproduction number would have
   been reduced further than by the reduction in the effective number of contacts. Third, all
   age groups are equally susceptible and infectious. As evidence accrues that children are less
   infectious or less susceptible [7, 23 – 25], and they have the largest numbers of contacts in
   the baseline survey, the reduction of the reproduction number is consequently less than the
   reduction in the effective number of contacts of 69% in the April 2020 survey. After
   relaxation of the measures, the focus of contact mixing shifts even more to younger age
   classes. Because of their limited role in transmission, the reduction of the effective
   reproduction number of COVID-19 should exceed the reduction in the effective number of
   contacts of 0%. Also general hygiene measures and use of face masks will have led to a
                                                                   15

   reduction of the reproduction number, but this effect is not captured in the contact
   matrices.
   The results of this study can immediately be applied to the public health response and
   management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimated contact reduction is applicable to
   other countries and regions with similar control measures. Combined with appropriate
   susceptibility and infectiousness profiles, the estimated age-specific contact matrices are
   useful for conducting scenario analyses with age-structured transmission models of COVID-
   19, to project the future course of the epidemic with or without physical distancing
   measures [26 - 28]. As we plan to repeat the contact survey at regular intervals, we will be
   able to monitor the number of contacts made over time and the fraction of close contacts.
   With infection numbers on the rise again, we can detect the impact of renewed physical
   distancing measures, as well as changes in compliance. We believe that contact surveys such
   as these can help to inform and guide infection control measures in these times of
   unprecedented physical distancing.
