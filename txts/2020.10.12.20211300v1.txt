    Abstract
    Background and Objectives. Self-regulation is a modifiable protective factor for lifespan
    mental and physical health outcomes. Early caregiver-mediated interventions to promote infant
    and child regulatory outcomes prevent long-term developmental, emotional, and behavioural
    difficulties and improve outcomes such as school readiness, educational achievement, and
    economic success. To harness the population health promise of these programmes, there is a
    need for more nuanced understanding of the impact of these interventions. The aim of this realist
    review is to understand how, why, under which circumstances, and for whom, early caregiver-
    mediated interventions improve infant and child self-regulation. The specific research questions
    guiding this review were based on consultation with families and community organizations that
    provide early childhood and family services.
    Design, Methods and Analysis: Realist reviews take a theory-driven and iterative approach to
    evidence synthesis, structured around continuous refinement of a programme theory. Programme
    theories specify context-mechanism-outcome configurations to explain what works, for whom,
    under which circumstances, and how. Our initial programme theory is based on prior work in
    this field and will be refined through searching peer-reviewed and grey literature to identify
    relevant evidence. A working group, comprising service users, community organization
    representatives, representatives from specific populations, clinicians, and review team members
    will be formed to guide the evidence synthesis and interpretation, as well as the development and
    dissemination of recommendations based on the findings of the review. The review will involve
    searching: (1) electronic databases (e.g. EMBASE, Medline, PsycInfo), (2) connected papers,
    articles and citations, and (3) grey literature. Decisions to include evidence will be guided by
    judgements about their contribution to the programme theory and will be made by the research
                                                                                                                                       3

    Strengths and Limitations
         •    Uses a realist approach to provide insight into what works, for whom, under which
              circumstances, and how for caregiver-mediated interventions designed to promote self-
              regulation outcomes among infants and young children.
         •    Research questions were developed in consultation with families and service providers.
         •    Decision-making will be transparently documented, and all review materials made
              available on the Open Science Framework repository.
         •    The programme theory will be largely derived from peer-reviewed journal articles, and
              therefore may be subject to publication bias.

    Background
              Self-regulation is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of top-down and bottom-up
    processes implicated in the capacity to flexibly regulate behaviour, cognition, and emotion.1 2
    Across developmental stages, healthy self-regulation is consistently associated with better mental
    health and adaptive functioning and improved human capital3-6 while self-regulatory difficulties
    are a risk factor for later mental and physical health problems.5-8 For example, self-regulatory
    difficulties in early childhood are associated with rapid weight gain through to early
    adolescence,9 while longitudinal studies have demonstrated that adults with no history of
    psychiatric diagnoses have significantly greater self-regulation in childhood than those with
    lifetime history of mental health problems.4 Differences in early self-regulation have been
    implicated in resilience to early adversity10-12 even when controlling for IQ and socioeconomic
    status.12 Self-regulation also predicts school readiness,13 academic achievement,14 self-worth,
    substance use, economic outcomes and criminal involvement.6 15 16
              Interactions between biological and environmental factors shape regulatory outcomes
    over the course of infancy and early childhood.17 18 Among typically developing children, basic
    self-regulatory capacities begin to emerge in the first months of life19 20 and increase in
    complexity across development, demonstrating a developmental cascade effect that parallels
    changes in neurobiology.21-23 This dynamic and self-reinforcing process supports increasingly
    sophisticated skills for adaptive and executive functioning:24 25 as children develop greater self-
    regulatory skills, they are more able to effectively engage with their environment, thereby
    fostering more adaptive outcomes.26 27 It is important to note, however, that these adaptive
    developmental cascades assume that children develop in the context of manageable demands on
    their self-regulatory capacities. In the context of early adversity such as adverse prenatal
                                                                                                                                       5

    exposures,28 29 socioeconomic stress, psychosocial threat, and neglect, cascade effects of
    adversity can work in the opposite way, undermining self-regulation and driving negative
    sequelae well into adulthood.5 30
    Promoting self-regulation through early intervention: the role of caregivers
              Caregivers are instrumental in the development and maintenance of self-regulatory
    capacities among infants and young children.31 As they develop, infants transition from
    dependence on caregivers for co-regulation to more autonomous self-regulation via multiple, co-
    occurring socialization processes.32 Regardless of developmental stage, in situations where
    regulatory demands are overwhelming, co-regulation via caregivers is important to support
    infants and children to respond adaptively to their environment. However, much like other
    environmental influences, the impact of caregiver behaviour on child self-regulatory outcomes
    can be positive or negative: reviews and meta-analyses have found that the use of positive
    caregiving strategies (such as guiding and encouraging) is associated with more adaptive child
    self-regulation, while negative caregiving strategies (such as criticism) are associated with poorer
    self-regulatory outcomes.31-34 Furthermore, evidence that caregiving mediates the relationship
    between early adversity and regulatory outcomes in children35 36 suggests that supporting
    positive caregiving practices is particularly important for families experiencing adversity.
              Evidence supports the assertion that caregiver-mediated interventions designed to foster
    self-regulation among infants and young children have potential to interrupt negative
    developmental cascades, and promote positive ones.22 Prior work by Murray and colleagues37
    reviewing studies of self-regulation programmes between 1989-2013 demonstrated the breadth
    of this literature, although they found substantially fewer programmes targeting the birth to age 2
    year group (k = 27) than those targeting 3-4 year olds (k = 75). Programmes that have been
                                                                                                                                       6

    found to promote self-regulation in infants and young children include, but are not limited to,
    Attachment and Biobehavioural Catch-Up,38 39 Triple P,40 the Incredible Years,41-43 the Family
    Check-Up, 44 45 Parent-Child Interaction Therapy,46-49 Head Start,50-52 the Chicago School
    Readiness Project, 53 the Kids in Transition to School Project,54 and Tools of the Mind.25 55-58
    However, inconsistencies in these programmes and their evaluation undermine capacity to draw
    inferences about how early self-regulation programmes work. For example, not all these
    programmes specifically target self-regulatory outcomes, there are differences used in the
    terminology used to describe the programme targets and components, and self-regulation
    outcomes are measured inconsistently across trials.2 59 Accordingly, it is unclear which
    components are considered key to promoting self-regulation outcomes and which are extraneous
    to this goal.2
    Factors influencing the effectiveness of caregiving programs to improve child self-regulation
              Conceptual and methodological issues notwithstanding, these interventions have shown
    evidence of benefit for a range of parent and child outcomes across a variety of populations and
    settings.60-63 For example, there is evidence that early intervention can improve self-regulation
    among infants and children exposed to early risk factors, such as socioeconomic adversity,64
    foster care,38 neglect,39 and pre-term birth.65 Early caregiving programmes may improve self-
    regulation outcomes when delivered remotely66 and in primary care settings. Together, these
    findings indicate a robustness of intervention effects across contexts. However, prior reviews and
    meta-analyses have also revealed important findings about the implementation of these
    interventions, including barriers to engagement and the circumstances under which such
    interventions do not work. For example, service location, incompatibility of programme delivery
    with work schedules, transport barriers, perceived stigma, and cost of delivery create
                                                                                                                                       7

    considerable barriers to programme engagement and implementation.67 68 Synthesizing these data
    on practical considerations that influence engagement and outcomes is important to inform
    implementation strategies.
              Despite the apparent robustness of self-regulation interventions across contexts, previous
    work has also highlighted how intervention characteristics interact with contextual factors to
    influence intervention effects. For instance, Rayno and McGrath 69 found that socioeconomic
    status and maternal mental health significantly predicted response to parenting interventions for
    child externalizing behaviour problems. Based on work demonstrating that socioeconomic stress
    adversely impacts caregiving behaviour by increasing caregiver distress, Rayno and McGrath
    suggested that one way of optimising intervention-context fit is to include additional components
    focusing on caregiver mental health when programmes are delivered to families with higher
    socioeconomic stress. Similarly, Harris, et al. 66 found that contact with an interventionist was
    necessary for technology-assisted caregiving interventions to effectively improve parent
    wellbeing in socioeconomically disadvantaged families. These findings illustrate the
    complexities of delivering ‘evidence-based’ caregiver-mediated self-regulation interventions in
    different settings for different target groups. The lack of synthesised understanding of how to
    respond to these complexities when delivering interventions can undermine translation. In
    reviewing the literature on caregiving interventions in paediatric primary care, Smith, et al. 70
    found that the dearth of information regarding implementation methods and contexts undermined
    the potential to deliver scalable and equitable caregiving intervention models.

    year-old children. We aim to highlight how and why these programmes work, as well as to
    identify for whom and under which circumstances these programmes lead to positive outcomes
    for children and families.
    Our objectives are as follows:
         1. To synthesize insights from peer-reviewed and grey literature, stakeholder perspectives,
              and expert guidance regarding what works, for whom, under which circumstances, and
              how, for caregiver-mediated self-regulation interventions for infants and young children.
         2. To develop a set of programme theories and corresponding evidence maps documenting
              relationships between intervention components, contextual factors, and mechanisms
              influencing outcomes of these interventions.
         3. To produce guidelines for intervention development and implementation based on the
              evidence synthesis.
    Methods
    Realist Review
              This review will use a realist approach to address questions around intervention
    mechanisms and implementation contexts and to generate insights into the question of what
    works, for whom, how, and in which settings. Realist synthesis is particularly useful where
    research is heterogenous, as is the case for the literature on early self-regulation interventions.71
    The realist approach aims to generate policy-relevant findings for the purposes of decision-
    making in programme financing and implementation. Realist approaches are appropriate for
    complex interventions where intervention effects are context-dependent. While randomised
                                                                                                                                       9

    controlled trials and meta-analyses help to answer the question of whether self-regulation
    interventions are effective or not, realist synthesis is a theory-driven approach that seek to
    determine why and how interventions do/do not work for different people in across different
    contexts.72 73
    Patient and Public Involvement
              The need for this review emerged from a series of consultations with families with a child
    with developmental, emotional and/or behavioural difficulties, for the purposes of understanding
    their needs regarding early screening and support. These consultations highlighted that parental
    awareness of children’s developmental difficulties often preceded formal recognition of these
    difficulties by health professionals, and that due to the highly variable nature of early
    development, families were frequently told to “wait and see” whether more pronounced and
    stable child difficulties would emerge. Families described this as a time of high concern and
    stress, with caregiver mental health and family functioning undermined by the burden of child
    developmental, emotional and/or behavioural difficulties coupled with the anxiety of “not
    knowing.” Accordingly, a potential solution was to investigate early intervention approaches that
    were cross-syndrome or transdiagnostic; that is, they target risk and/or protective factors that are
    implicated in a wide range of developmental, emotional and behavioural difficulties, and can be
    implemented prior to formal diagnosis.
              Self-regulation is one such transdiagnostic factor that is meaningful to caregivers and
    service providers, given that child self-regulatory difficulties are a common reason that parents
    seek support from health professionals and family services. Our community partners
    (organisations providing family and early childhood services in Australia) identified a gap in the
    availability of evidence-based self-regulation interventions for infants and toddlers and expressed
                                                                                                                                     10

    a desire to understand more about which interventions should be recommended for which
    families under which circumstances. Of particular interest to our community partners is the
    appropriateness of different self-regulation interventions for Aboriginal and Torres Strait
    Islander (Indigenous) families, Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) families, families
    experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage, and families living in rural and remote areas.
              Together, the input from families and community partners directly shaped the focus of
    the proposed review. The need to synthesise insights into what works, for whom, under which
    circumstances and how for early self-regulation interventions is guided by our community
    partners’ interest in optimising intervention strategies for the multiple communities they serve. It
    is also of importance to guide families, who, in the absence of formal recognition and guidance
    regarding child difficulties, are often required to make decisions about which types of strategies
    and services are most appropriate for their needs.
              We have planned for ongoing involvement of families and community partners in the
    review process. We will establish a working group with a balance of caregivers and
    representatives from community organisations to provide input into all stages of the review. The
    group will comprise representatives from community organizations (early childhood and family
    services), practitioners, service users (i.e. parents with young children), research and clinical
    experts in the field of infant and child self-regulation, as well as members of the review team.
    The working group will play a key role in interpreting the findings of the review, developing
    theory, and establishing consensus. They will also play a key role in developing the
    recommendations and guiding translation of the findings into policy and practice. We anticipate
    that the findings of the review will be used to guide intervention development and/or
    implementation as part of our ongoing work in this field. Families and community partners

         1. What are the key contextual factors (for example, implementation strategies, setting,
              mode of delivery, and population characteristics) which influence the success or failure
              of early caregiving interventions to support self-regulation?
         2. What are the core intervention components and key intervention mechanisms which, in
              the right contexts, lead to the success of early caregiving interventions to support self-
              regulation?
         3. How do core components and key intervention mechanisms vary across age groups from
              0-5 years?
         4. What is known about “what works” to improve child self-regulatory outcomes among (i)
              Indigenous and CALD families; (ii) families with socioeconomic disadvantage; and (iii)
              families living in rural and remote areas? Specifically, how do contextual factors, core
              components, key mechanisms and outcomes vary across populations?
         5. How might these findings influence future research, policy, and practice?
    Design
              We will follow the five steps outlined by Pawson, et al. 74: (1) clarifying the review’s
    scope; (2) defining the search strategy; (3) selecting studies for inclusion in the review; (4)
    extracting data from included studies; and (5) evidence synthesis and recommendations. Steps 1-
    2 and 5 will be done in active consultation with working groups formed with families and other
                                                                                                                                     12

    stakeholders. The review will be reported according to the Realist and MEta-narrative Evidence
    Synthesis: Evolving Standards (RAMESES) standards for realist syntheses.75 The review was
    registered with the Open Science Framework on the 10th October, 2020. Project documents,
    including refinements to the search strategy, decisions regarding evidence inclusion and
    exclusion, and amendments to the protocol will be documented on the project site
    (https://bit.ly/34J7oY2).
         The primary output of this review will be an evidence-based programme theory for early
    caregiving interventions to support infant and child self-regulation, highlighting the key
    mechanisms of these interventions and the contextual factors that influence their effectiveness
    across populations and settings. We aim to use the findings of this review to generate a set of
    recommendations for the development and delivery of early caregiving programmes to optimise
    intervention effectiveness, fidelity, and equity. Recommendations will concern core components,
    implementation principles and strategies, and considerations regarding setting and mode of
    delivery. We also aim to use the findings of this review to inform local intervention development
    and implementation efforts.
    Working Definitions and Preliminary Scope
              For the purposes of this review, ‘early self-regulation interventions’ are those that are
    delivered from the time children are born up to and including 5 years of age. We will focus on
    caregiver-mediated interventions given that most early self-regulation interventions for this age
    group focus on caregivers76 and because this focus aligns with the priorities and interests of the
    families and community organisations we consulted with. Following Murray and colleagues,37
    we will include studies of caregiving interventions that either explicitly target infant/child self-
    regulation or those that measure infant or child self-regulation as an outcome. As interventions
                                                                                                                                     13

    that promote self-regulation have been referred to in the literature using various terms, we will
    also focus on interventions that aim to promote children’s executive functioning and emotion
    regulation skills and reduce challenging behaviour. We will include universal or targeted
    interventions delivered across all contexts and settings.
    Step 1: Clarifying the scope of the review and developing a programme theory
              Realist reviews are theory-driven, using an iterative approach to selecting, developing,
    and refining programme theories to explain why and how interventions work for different people
    in different contexts.72 74 Thus, the first stage of the review will involve clarifying the review
    scope and defining the initial programme theory. Given the inconsistencies in terminology used
    across self-regulation interventions, an initial step is to identify key constructs associated with
    “self-regulation intervention” and develop a list of exemplar programs. These will be identified
    through initial scoping of the literature using a broad set of search terms (see Table 1 for an
    example of the Medline search strategy). In addition to searching peer reviewed and grey
    literature, we will liaise with the working group to identify other forms of evidence that do not
    take the form of peer reviewed studies, such as policy documents. At the scoping stage, we will
    focus on programmes that have been developed for infants and young children, 0-5 years, that
    involve caregiver-mediated strategies to promote child self-regulation and/or that measure infant
    and child self-regulation as an outcome. As the focus of the realist review is on theory
    development, we will include intervention studies with and without a comparator condition.
              In the realist approach, programme theories are comprised of ‘context’ (C), ‘mechanism’
    (M) and ‘outcome’ (O) – referred to here as the C-M-O framework. Interventions are thought to
    impact outcomes by altering context (e.g., increasing caregiver knowledge and skills), thereby
    influencing the mechanisms (e.g., increasing responsive caregiving behaviour) that drive
                                                                                                                                     14

    outcomes. Prior reviews have demonstrated that caregiving programs to improve child self-
    regulation include a vast array of program components. For example, effective interventions for
    preschool-age children have included components to increase proactive parenting, parent
    involvement, positive behaviour management, parental guidance, and limit-setting.45 51 It is
    unclear whether these different components influence self-regulatory outcomes via a smaller
    subset of shared mechanisms. For example, Sandler, et al. 77 suggest that three main factors
    account for long-term effects of parenting programmes: parenting skills, self-efficacy, and parent
    mental health.

    theory structured around the C-M-O framework. We will also consult with the working group to
    identify experts and key stakeholders to input to the programme theory. The resulting theoretical,
                                                                                                                                     16

    explanatory model and its component contexts, mechanisms and outcomes of interest will be
    used as the framework for the succeeding stages of the review.
    Step 2. Refining the search strategy
              The refined search strategy will be based on the emerging programme theory. Given the
    vast array of potential contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes that may emerge from the self-
    regulation intervention literature, we will consult with the working group to decide which C-M-
    O variables should be the primary focus of the review. Once this has been agreed, we will
    systematically search for literature to extend and refine the scope of studies identified in Step 1,
    with the aim of testing and refining the programme theory. This approach aligns with the
    iterative nature of the realist methodology.74 Electronic database searching in Ovid Embase,
    PsycInfo, Medline and Web of Science79 will be carried out using keywords based on the
    interventions, concepts, mechanisms, theories, and outcomes identified in the scoping stage. We
    will identify additional studies for inclusion by handsearching reference lists of included papers
    to find connected texts and by searching the grey literature. The search will be a multi-stage
    process that integrates consultation with the working group and other key stakeholders. A series
    of Endnote libraries will be created to document the results of each stage of the search process.
    Step 3: Selecting data sources for inclusion in the review
              Selection of data sources for inclusion in the review will primarily be based on their
    relevance to the C-M-O components of the programme theory. Several different types of
    evidence can be integrated within the scope of a realist review75; accordingly, we anticipate that
    data sources will include peer-reviewed journal articles, policy documents, and programme
    manuals. Two research team members will independently screen titles and abstracts of the data
                                                                                                                                     17

    sources against the inclusion and exclusion criteria (or refined versions of these criteria
    developed following the initial search). Data sources will be independently ranked by two
    members of the team, according to their relevance to their programme theory and the rigour of
    the findings. The “rigour” dimension will be appraised by the review team members based on
    how robustly the methods of a given data source (including entire studies and components within
    a study) support the conclusions drawn from it. The review team will use these rankings to guide
    selection of data sources, in consultation with the working group. Excel spreadsheets will be
    used to track decisions and rationale for the inclusion and exclusion of specific studies.
    Step 4: Extracting data from included sources
              According to the realist approach, extracted data should be used to determine whether
    programme theories and their components are meaningful and productive.80 Data sources and
    extracted data will therefore be included based on their capacity to test and refine the emerging
    programme theory. Extracted data will be mapped against the programme theory and research
    questions, with the overarching aim of identifying the core components of effective self-
    regulation interventions across contexts. We will design data extraction forms based on the C-M-
    O framework and using the interventions, contexts, mechanisms, theories, and outcomes
    identified in the scoping stage. It is anticipated that, at a minimum, extracted data will include
    study authors, year of publication, study country; study design; sample characteristics and
    inclusion criteria; intervention components, mode of delivery, and characteristics of intervention
    facilitators, as well as data on the context in which the intervention is studied, and predictors,
    mediators, and moderators of intervention outcome. Finally, we will extract data on outcomes:
    our primary outcome of interest is infant and child self-regulation, however we are also
    interested in related outcomes such as infant and child mental health, family functioning,
                                                                                                                                     18

    caregiver mental health, self-regulation, caregiving behaviours, and self-efficacy. Quality
    appraisal (separate from evaluations of relevance and rigour) will be undertaken to summarise
    the overall quality of the included studies. We will use the Cochrane RoB 2 revised risk-of-bias
    tool81 for randomized trials, the Cochrane ROBINS-I tool82 for non-randomized intervention
    studies, and the 32-item Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research.83
    Step 5: Evidence synthesis and recommendations
              The focus of evidence synthesis will be on the testing and refinement of the programme
    theory. In this stage of the review, we will code interventions using the C-M-O framework and
    generate a series of C-M-O configurations that can be applied to different populations across
    different settings. We will undertake qualitative data synthesis using NVivo, and map
    interventions against C-M-O variables using an evidence mapping spreadsheet developed for the
    purposes of this review. Where relevant, summary statistics will be used to characterise the
    included studies. We will use a narrative approach to synthesise findings and report these
    according to the RAMESES guidelines.
    Generation of Recommendations and Dissemination of Findings.
              A draft summary of the findings and recommendations will be reviewed by the working
    group and key stakeholders, who will provide input into their relevance and meaning for policy
    and practice applications. A final list of recommendations for the development and
    implementation of caregiver-mediated interventions to support self-regulation among infants and
    young children will be determined by consensus of the working group. Findings and
    recommendations will be disseminated through a report and policy brief, journal articles, and
                                                                                                                                     19

    broader community networks to develop evidence summaries that are useful to families.
    Discussion
    Importance of the Research
              Self-regulation is a cornerstone of healthy development,5 and early interventions to
    promote self-regulation have potential to support adaptive outcomes across the lifespan.37 This
    realist review will provide important insights into how caregiver-mediated interventions for
    infants and young children promote self-regulation outcomes and improve long-term
    functioning. Understanding how such interventions work, who they work for, and under which
    contexts, can help to optimize intervention and implementation strategies. Documenting how
    well the existing evidence supports the programme theory will also aid in refining theoretical
    understandings of caregiver-mediated interventions for infants and young children and highlight
    key gaps in the research. In addition, identifying mechanisms underlying early caregiver-
    mediated programmes to improve self-regulation process, will enable us to design experimental
    studies to test these mechanisms in the future.
                We anticipate that the findings of this review will provide key practical advice for health
    professionals and community service providers working to provide early childhood and family
    services, as well as service users, policymakers, and researchers. Our intention is to provide a
    trans-professional explanation of how, why, and under which circumstances caregiver-led self-
    regulation interventions can best support children’s development. We will work with the range of
    stakeholders in our working group to determine the best way to summarise and disseminate the
    findings from the review so it can be used to guide practical decisions around implementation.
