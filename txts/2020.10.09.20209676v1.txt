   Abstract
             Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related
   cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction,
   contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial
   direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder
   (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the
   common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results.
             In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to
   either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary
   outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary
   measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive
   function including impulsivity.
             An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there
   was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group,
   an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity
   improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group × time interactions showed
   improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to
   change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and
   craving.
             This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on
   craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the
   real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions.

   Introduction
             Drug addiction is a chronic brain disorder characterized by a relapsing cycle of compulsive
   drug seeking and using followed by withdrawal and craving that repeat despite harmful
   consequences (Volkow & Fowler, 2000). The underlying mechanisms encompass impairments in
   prefrontal cortex-mediated functions that include reduced inhibitory control of automatic or
   maladaptive behaviors, as well as the attribution of excessive salience to the drug and drug-related
   cues at the expense of non-drug related stimuli and cues, in a syndrome referred to as the impaired
   response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA; (Goldstein & Volkow, 2002, 2011).
   Specifically, dysfunction in dorsolateral subregions of the prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), associated
   with impairments in executive control, is thought to contribute to impulsive, compulsive,
   inflexible, or stimulus-driven behaviors (Lubman et al., 2004; Simon et al., 2007; Garavan et al.,
   2008), including craving. Drug craving, the intense subjective urge to use drugs, predicts clinical
   outcomes such as drug use and the propensity to relapse in drug addicted individuals (Ludwig &
   Wikler, 1974; Weiss et al., 2003; Paliwal et al., 2008; Chaves et al., 2011). Craving has therefore
   been considered an important therapeutic target in the treatment of substance use disorders (Tiffany
   & Wray, 2012; Tiffany et al., 2012). However, as most pharmacological treatments and behavioral
   therapies for this purpose show inconsistent results (Hennessy et al., 2003; Sofuoglu & Kosten,
   2006; Zilverstand et al., 2016; Mellentin et al., 2017; Liu & Li, 2018), reducing craving in drug
   addiction remains a challenge.
             Through the use of magnetic or electric brain stimulation, neuromodulation has recently
   gained momentum as an adjunct therapy for various psychiatric conditions including bipolar
   disorder and depression as well as for pain management (Kuo et al., 2014; Rapinesi et al., 2015;
   Sampaio-Junior et al., 2018). By targeting specific brain regions implicated in addiction such as
                                                                                                                                       4

   the dlPFC, neuromodulation has also been used in drug addicted individuals to reduce craving and
   maladaptive addiction-related behaviors (see Ekhtiari et al., 2019 for review). A recent meta-
   analysis of studies using non-invasive brain stimulation over the dlPFC, the medial prefrontal
   cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex, showed a specific strong main effect on drug craving in
   stimulant-addicted individuals (Ma et al., 2019). For instance, repeated sessions of transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (TMS), which consists of focal electromagnetic pulses that elicit neuronal
   firing in the targeted region under a coil positioned on the scalp (Hallett, 2007; Wagner et al., 2007;
   Rossi et al., 2009), showed reductions in subjective craving as well as drug intake when the dlPFC
   was targeted in cocaine addicted individuals (Bolloni et al., 2016; Rapinesi et al., 2016; Terraneo
   et al., 2016). A study in young males with cocaine use disorder (CUD) found that even a single
   session of repetitive TMS had an effect (albeit transient) on reducing craving (Camprodon et al.,
   2007). Although these studies show promising outcomes, the widespread use of TMS is limited by
   several factors (e.g., its lack of portability, the expertise required for administration, expense, etc.).
   As a battery-powered portable device that can be used remotely and repetitively, transcranial direct
   current stimulation (tDCS) directly applies small amounts of continuous low-intensity electric
   currents to the scalp in order to facilitate, in a polarity-dependent fashion, cortical excitability
   through changes in neuronal membrane potentials (Bindman et al., 1964; Nitsche & Paulus, 2000).
   The repeated use of tDCS specifically targeting the dlPFC either daily or every other day for up to
   10 days showed a reduction in subjective self-reported craving (Batista et al., 2015; de Almeida
   Ramos et al., 2016; Klauss et al., 2018), and a decrease in electrophysiological measures of drug-
   related cue reactivity (Conti & Nakamura-Palacios, 2014; Conti et al., 2014; Nakamura-Palacios
   et al., 2016) as well as in risk-taking behaviors (Gorini et al., 2014) in individuals with CUD
   (studies mostly conducted in Brazil). Recently, a study combining tDCS and positron emission
   tomography in healthy individuals suggested that repeated tDCS over the dlPFC induced dopamine
                                                                                                                                       5

   release in the ventral striatum, a hub within the reward and motivation network, pointing to a
   possible putative neurochemical mechanism of such scalp-based brain stimulation (Fonteneau et
   al., 2018).
             The goal of the current Phase 1 clinical trial was therefore to replicate the previous tDCS
   findings in treatment-seeking individuals with CUD living in an inpatient drug-rehabilitation
   facility in a northeastern US urban area. Given an ultimate goal of developing a home-based self-
   administration protocol, a related main aim was to assess the feasibility of administering 15
   repeated sessions of tDCS in contrast to the previous shorter tDCS administration protocols. Based
   on the previous findings (Batista et al., 2015), our main hypothesis was that real-tDCS will be
   associated with a decrease in the subjective reports of cocaine craving as well as symptoms of
   anxiety and depression, and with an increase in quality of life measures. In line with the literature,
   we also assessed the effect of repeated tDCS on secondary outcome measures, including subjective
   sleep measures (Minichino et al., 2014; Frase et al., 2016; Sheng et al., 2018; Charest et al., 2019),
   readiness to change (Opsal et al., 2019), and positive and negative affect (Wiegand et al., 2019).
   Neuropsychological tests measuring verbal fluency (including drug-related fluency as a proxy of
   cue-reactivity), temporal discounting/impulsivity, and self-reported sensitivity to reinforcement of
   rewards (Goldstein et al., 2010), were also included for exploratory purposes.
   Materials and Methods
   Participants
             Twenty-nine detoxified and abstinent individuals with CUD between the ages of 18 and 65
   years were recruited from, and studied at, an inpatient addiction treatment facility (Samaritan
   Daytop Village – Jamaica, Queens, NY). Potential participants were identified from rolling
                                                                                                                                       6

   admissions and were screened for the study following a period of detoxification (≥two weeks since
   last drug use). All participants met the diagnostic criteria for CUD as corroborated by a
   comprehensive diagnostic interview that included the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic
   and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (First, 2015) and the Addiction Severity
   Index (McLellan et al., 1992) to evaluate lifetime drug use and recency of drug use. Drug use
   questionnaires and scales also included the 5-item Severity of Dependence Scale (Foltin, 1999),
   the 18-item Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (Kampman et al., 1998) for withdrawal
   symptoms within 24 hours of the interview, and the Cocaine Negative Consequences Checklist
   (Michalec et al., 1996). Exclusion criteria were: 1) current or past history of a major neurological
   disorder, seizures or a neurodevelopmental disorder; 2) a history of head trauma with loss of
   conciousness (for ≥30 minutes); 3) history of Axis I disorders (with the exception of CUD)
   associated with psychotic symptoms; 4) medication use with known effects on the central nervous
   system within the past 6 months (except psychotropics for symptoms of depression/anxiety/post
   traumatic stress disorder); 5) a clinically significant and/or unstable medical illness or infection; 6)
   the presence of contraindicated metallic implants or devices that may be affected by electrical
   stimulation; and 7) pregnancy or breast feeding in women. All participants provided full written
   consent in accordance with both the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the Samaritan
   Daytop Village’s institutional review boards. This study was registered under Clinical Trials.gov
   number NCT03833583.
             Of the 29 inpatients with CUD who were consented, one was withdrawn from the study
   (due to inability to attend the appointments) (Figure 1). Of the remaining 28 subjects, 17 individuals
   qualified for the study (meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria), completing the pre-treatment
   behavioral assessments before being randomly assigned to either the real-tDCS or the sham-tDCS
   condition (control group). During the course of treatment, three participants withdrew from the
                                                                                                                                       7

   study, all in the sham-tDCS group (this intriguing difference between the groups in drop-out rate
   should be further explored with larger samples). They were considered lost to follow-up: two
   relapsed (after 4 and 9 sessions, respectively) leaving the treatment facility on their own accord;
   the third participant was transferred to another facility (that did not allow participation in research)
   after 12 sessions. Of the 14 subjects who completed all 15 tDCS sessions, 12 participants (real-
   tDCS: N = 7; sham-tDCS: N = 5) attended a one-month follow-up visit (2 participants were not
   able to attend due to a change in treatment location). All subjects continued taking their prescribed
   medications throughout the study. The demographic, neuropsychological and drug-related
   variables of the subjects who completed all 15 tDCS sessions in both groups are presented in Table
   1.
   Double-Blind Study Procedures
             Fourteen participants underwent all 15 sessions of either real-tDCS or sham-tDCS every
   other day over five weeks. The stimulations were administered using a battery-driven 1×1 (one
   anode and one cathode) portable tDCS mini-CT device (Soterix Medical, Inc., New York, USA).
   Two single-use 35 cm2 sponge electrodes pre-soaked in a saline solution were used with the
   cathodal electrode placed over the left hemisphere (F3 electrode) and the anodal electrode over the
   right hemisphere (F4 electrode) targeting the dlPFC. The anodal (positive) and cathodal (negative)
   nature of the stimulation refers to the polarity of the electrode placed over the targeted area (Woods
   et al., 2016), whereby cortical excitability is increased beneath the anode and decreased beneath
   the cathode (Nitsche & Paulus, 2000). While TMS induces neuronal firing directly beneath the
   stimulation coil (Opitz et al., 2011), tDCS is thought to enhance a more diffused neuronal plasticity
   underneath the large electrodes on the scalp, potentially reaching broader regions of interest (Datta
   et al., 2009; Opitz et al., 2013; DaSilva et al., 2015; Santos et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017).
   Electrode placement was ensured by a premeasured strap (Soterix Medical, Inc., New York, USA),
                                                                                                                                       8

   fitted to the participant’s headsize, on which the electrodes were snapped. Every electrode
   placement was photographed prior to each stimulation in order to assess the reliability of the
   positioning in-between sessions. The tDCS devices were pre-programmed to deliver real- or sham-
   tDCS by a co-author who was not involved in data acquisition or analyses, and both the
   experimenters and the participants were not aware of the applied treatment. In the real-tDCS
   condition, each stimulation delivered 2mA for a duration of 20 minutes. Stimulations started with
   a 30-second ramp up, during which the device slowly increased the amount of energy delivered to
   reach 2mA. A ramp down to zero occurred during the last 30 seconds of the stimulation. In order
   to maintain effective subject blinding, the sham-tDCS condition also included the 30 seconds ramp
   up from zero to 2mA followed by an immediate ramp down back to zero where the device did not
   deliver any current. At the end of the 20-minute sham-tDCS session, the same ramp up and ramp
   down was reproduced once again to mimic the tingling sensation under the electrodes usually
   reported by subjects receiving active stimulation (Brunoni et al., 2011). The actual length of the
   stimulation for all sessions was recorded on the tDCS device and all recordings were verified after
   the study in order to ensure that each participant received the intended set amount of stimulation.
   The blind was only removed after the completion of the entire study inclusive of data analyses.
   Behavioral Assessment and Outcome Measures
             Neuropsychological tests evaluated: 1) handedness [modified Edinburgh Handedness
   Inventory (Milenkovic & Dragovic, 2013)]; 2) color blindness [abbreviated version of the Ishihara
   color blindness test (Ishihara, 1917) with all subjects except for one of normal color vision]; 3)
   estimated premorbid verbal IQ [Wide Range Achievement Test (Wilkinson, 1993) – Reading
   scale]; 4) estimated premorbid non-verbal IQ [Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence
   (Wechsler, 1999) – Matrix Reasoning Subtest]; 5) verbal fluency (semantic and drug) (Goldstein
                                                                                                                                       9

   et al., 2007, 2009; Lezak et al., 2012); and 6) the Kirby Delay Discounting Task for temporal
   discounting/impulsivity (Kirby et al., 1999).
             The primary outcome measures, aimed at replicating previous findings (Batista et al.,
   2015), included the: 1) a subscale of the Obsessive-Compulsive Cocaine Scale (Vorspan et al.,
   2012) that includes 5 items (1, 2, 4, 5, and 13) known to be specificaly associated with cocaine
   cravings (De Wildt et al., 2005); 2) 5-item Cocaine Craving Questionnaire (Tiffany et al., 1993) to
   further measure subjective cocaine craving; 3) Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (Hamilton, 1959)
   for state anxiety; 4) Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Hamilton, 1960) for state depression; and
   5) an abbreviated version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (Skevington et al.,
   2004) for measures of quality of life on four different domains (physical health, psychological,
   social relationship, and environment).
             Secondary outcome measures included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Johns, 1991)
   assessing the likelihood of falling asleep in various situations (ranging from “would never doze”
   to “high chance of dozing”), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Buysse et al., 1989) to assess
   sleep quality as well as daily interviews to assess sleep quantity (number of hours of sleep during
   the previous night). Included were also the Contemplation Ladder (Biener & Abrams, 1991) that
   evaluates participants’ willingness to change their drug use (with a score of 0 being associated
   with: “No thoughts about quitting. I cannot live without drugs,” a score of 4 being associated with:
   “I sometimes think about changing the way that I use drugs, but I have not planned to change it
   yet,” a score of 8 being associated with: “I still use drugs, but I will begin to change, like cutting
   back on the amount of drugs that I use,” and a score of 10 being associated with: “I have changed

   the Sensitivity to Reinforcement of Addictive and other Primary Rewards questionnaire (STRAP-
   R) (Goldstein et al., 2010) to assess the liking and wanting of drug and non-drug rewards.
   Statistical Analyses
             A first set of statistical analyses was conducted to investigate group differences at baseline
   on demographic variables and the IQ measures. Continuous variables were compared using
   Student’s T-tests whereas chi-squared (χ2) tests were used for categorical variables. A second set
   of analyses aimed at assessing pre- vs. post-tDCS effects using 2 (Group: sham vs. real-tDCS) × 2
   (Time: pre- vs. post-tDCS) analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures for variables of
   interest that included select neuropsychological tests, clinical drug variables as well as the primary
   and secondary outcome variables. Daily measures of cocaine craving and sleep quantity were
   assessed with two 2 (Group: sham vs. real-tDCS) × 15 (Time: all study sessions) ANOVAs with
   repeated measures. The STRAP-R data were analysed following a previously published procedure
   (Goldstein et al., 2010) with a 2 (Group: sham vs. real-tDCS) × 3 (Reward: food, sex, drug) × 3
   (Situation: ‘current’, ‘in general’, ‘under the influence’), × 2 (Question: ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’), ×
   2 (Times: pre-tDCS, post-tDCS) mixed repeated-measures ANOVA. Finally, in order to
   investigate any potential longer-lasting effects of tDCS stimulation, additional 2 (Group: sham vs.
   real-tDCS) × 3 (Time: pre-tDCS, post-tDCS, and 1-month follow-up) ANOVAs with repeated
   measures were carried out for the primary and secondary variables that showed any significant
   Time or Group × Time interactions in the first set of ANOVAs. In all ANOVAs, simple effects
   were analyzed to follow-up significant interactions. Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used for
   repeated measures ANOVAs if needed. Covariates were the demographic, neuropsychological or
   clinical drug use measures that differed between the groups and correlated with any of the outcome
   measures that showed any significant results (Pocock et al., 2002). For this pilot small N study,
                                                                                                                                     11

   Results
   Demographic Variables and Neuropsychological Tests
             Supporting the randomization procedure and the creation of matched groups, there were no
   significant group differences at baseline in any of the demographic variables or neuropsychological
   tests (Table 1, which includes Cohen’s d effect sizes for the repeated measures ANOVA). A main
   effect for Time was significant for the Kirby Delay Discounting Task, where both groups showed
   decreased values of k from pre- to post-tDCS suggesting improvement in the ability to value
   delayed rewards with inpatient treatment [F(1,12) = 5.68, p = 0.035, d = 1.4]. There were no other
   Time or interaction effects that reached significance for the neuropsychological tests [F(1,12) <
   1.64, p > 0.225, d < .74].
   Clinical Drug Use Measures
             Our 2 × 2 ANOVAs with repeated measures showed the expected significant increase in
   abstinence length (days) in both groups [F(1,12) = 31.5, p = 0.01, d = 3.2] from pre- to post-tDCS,
   suggesting adherence to the inpatient treatment. A significant group effect was detected for the
   Cocaine Negative Consequences Checklist where the real-tDCS group reported overall less
   negative consequences of cocaine use than the sham-tDCS group [F(1,12) = 6.53, p = 0.025, d =
   1.5]; since this measure did not correlate with any of the outcome measures that showed significant
   results (below), we did not include it as a covariate in the subsequent analyses. There were no other
   significant effects for any of the other drug use variables including lifetime cocaine use, severity
   of dependence, and withdrawal symptoms at time of study.

   Primary Outcome Measures
             The 2 (Group) × 2 (Time) ANOVA with repeated measures with the 5-item Obsessive-
   Compulsive Cocaine Scale craving subscale yielded no significant effects. However, since a trend
   for a Group effect (p = 0.1, one-tailed statistical test) was observed, we explored the same ANOVA
   with repeated measures while correcting for baseline values. This analysis showed a trend for a
   significant Group × Time interaction [F(1,11) = 3.885, p = 0.074, Figure 2A] where only the real-
   tDCS group showed decreased self-reported craving scores after 15 sessions of stimulation. Power
   analysis (G*Power v3.1.9.4) suggested that 15 subjects per group would allow sufficient power
   (80%) for detecting this effect at the .05 significance level. The ANOVA for the 5-item Cocaine
   Craving Questionnaire showed a trend for a Time effect [F(1,12) = 4.17, p = 0.064, d = 1.2, Figure
   2B] that was further supported by a closer look at the self-reported craving intensity item on the
   Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment, showing a significant Time effect [F(1,12) = 7.15, p =
   0.020, d = 1.5, Figure 2C], together suggesting decreased self-reported craving from pre- to post-
   tDCS. Similarly, the 2 × 15 ANOVA for the daily self-report of cocaine craving revealed a trend
   for a Time main effect [F(14,168) = 1.63, p = 0.075, d = .20, Figure 4A], with a linear contrast
   reaching significance (p < 0.05) to suggest a linear decrease in craving over the 15 sessions across
   all subjects. A Time main effect was also significant for the World Health Organization Quality
   of Life, the environment scale [F(1,12) = 10.92, p = 0.006, d = 1.9], which increased from pre- to
   post-tDCS in both groups, again consistent with adherence to the inpatient treatment and the overall
   longer abstinence. No significant effects were observed for state depression or anxiety [F(1,12) <
   1.87, p > 0.197, d < .79].
   Secondary Outcome Measures
             The 2 × 2 ANOVAs with repeated measures showed a significant Group × Time interaction
   for the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [F(1,11) = 5.18, p = 0.044, d = 1.4, Figure 3A]; the main effects
                                                                                                                                     13

   of Group and Time were not significant [F(1,11) < 3.05, p > 0.109, d < 1.1]. Follow-up analyses
   showed that this interaction was explained by a group difference (real-tDCS < sham-tDCS) post
   [t(12) = 2.48, p = 0.029] but not pre-tDCS [t(11) = 0.30, p = 0.774)] suggesting that individuals
   with CUD who received real-tDCS reported less sleepiness than those in the sham-tDCS group
   after all 15 tDCS sessions. The 2 × 15 ANOVA of the daily reports of the amount of sleep yielded
   corroborating results (Figure 4B). Here, the Group by Time interaction did not reach significance
   [F(14,168) = 0.74, p = 0.729, d = .13], instead revealing a Group main effect (real-tDCS > sham-
   tDCS) [F(1,12) = 7.15, p = 0.020, d = 1.5]. Subsequent exploratory t-tests however showed real-
   as compared to the sham-tDCS participants to report significantly more hours of sleep after the 5th
   [t(12) = -2.43, p = 0.032], 9th [t(12) = -3.08, p = 0.009], 11th [t(12) = -2.31, p = 0.040], and 12th
   [t(12) = -2.58, p = 0.024] sessions with similar trends for the 8th [t(12) = -2.41, p = 0.054] and 15th
   [t(12) = -2.03, p = 0.065] sessions but not for the first 4 sessions [t(12) < -1.52, p > 0.155],
   indicating that the groups started differentiating later during treatment (See Figure 4B). In contrast,
   sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, showed a Time main effect,
   indicative of a decrease in the overall sleep quality during inpatient treatment in both groups
   [F(1,11) = 5.02, p = 0.047, d = 1.4]. A Group × Time interaction [F(1,12) = 5.40, p = 0.039, d =
   1.3, Figure 3B] was also significant for the Contemplation Ladder where simple effects showed a
   trend towards increase in readiness to change in the real-tDCS [t(7) = -2.35, p = 0.051] but not
   sham-tDCS [t(5) = 1.0, p = 0.363] group (Figure 3B), suggesting higher readiness to change after
   the stimulation sessions in the real-tDCS group.
   One-Month Follow-Up
             Using 2 (Group) × 3 (Time) ANOVAs with repeated measures, analyses were carried out
   for the three outcome variables that showed significant Group × Time interactions (or a trend) and
   for all outcome variables (in addition to the craving intensity item on the Cocaine Selective Severity
                                                                                                                                     14

   Assessment) that showed a significant Time effect (Table 1, Figure 5). While correcting for
   baseline value, no Group × Time interaction was found for the 5-item OCCS craving subscale
   [F(2,18) = 2.32, p = 0.127, Figure 5A] but a significant Group effect is otherwise found where the
   real-tDCS group shows lower craving scores than the sham-tDCS group [F(1,9) = 6.31, p < 0.033].
   Although no significant effect was found for the 5-item Cocaine Craving Questionnaire [F(2,20) <
   2.11, p > 0.147, Figure 5B] either, the craving question of the Cocaine Selective Severity
   Assessment showed a significant Time effect, driven by decreases in cocaine cravings during
   treatment and their increase back to baseline one month following the protocol [F(2,20) = 3.62, p
   = 0.045]. A significant interaction effect for the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [F(2,9) = 6.07, p =
   0.011, Table 2 and Figure 5C] was driven by a significant time effect only in the real-tDCS group
   [F(1,6) = 5.71, p = 0.021] such that participants reported more sleepiness at follow-up when
   compared to the immediate post-tDCS assessment (p = 0.009) suggesting that values returned to
   baseline after one month follow-up in this group. There were no significant effects for the
   Contemplation Ladder [F(2,20) < 1.75, p > 0.199, Figure 5D] nor for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
   Index [F(2,18) < 2.20, p > 0.172, Figure 5F]. The environment domain of the Quality of Life
   Questionnaire showed a significant Time effect [F(2,20) = 5.70, p = 0.011, Figure 5E] where values
   were higher in both groups after the 15 tDCS sessions, remaining elevated after a one-month
   follow-up (p < 0.05).
   STRAP-R
             Our 5-way mixed ANOVA showed main effects of Group [sham-tDCS > real-tDCS,
   F(1,12) = 9.48, p = 0.010], Reward [Food = Sex > Drug, F(2,24) = 16.35, p < 0.0001], and Question

   3-way Reward × Situation × Question interaction [F(4,48) = 4.04, p = 0.007] (See Table 3). To

   follow up on the significant interactions, 3 (Situation) × 2 (Question) ANOVAs with repeated
   measures were carried out independently for each Reward type. For the Food reward, there were
   significant Situation [“now” = “in general” > “under the influence”, F(1.27,16.45) = 6.54, p <
   0.016] and Question effects [“liking” > “wanting”, F(1,13) = 5.17, p = 0.041] . The Sex reward
   showed the same Question effect [“liking” > “wanting”, F(1,13) = 5.56, p = 0.035]; there were no
   other significant effects [F < 1.40, p > 0.269]. Consistent with our prior reports (Goldstein et al.,
   2010), for the Drug reward, there was a significant Situation main effect [“now” < “in general” <
   “under the influence”, F(2,26) = 33.56, p < 0.0001]. A significant Situation × Question interaction
   effect was also observed [F(1.39, 18.03) = 13.02, p = 0.001] and showed that “liking” was higher
   than “wanting” for both the “now” (t(13) = 3.37, p = 0.005) and “in general” (t(13) = 2.68, p =
   0.019) situations whereas “wanting” was higher than “liking” for the “under the influence” (t(13)
   = -3.30, p = 0.006) situation. No significant effects for Time [F(1,12) = 0.44, p = 0.522] or
   interactions with Time or Group [F < 2.18, p > 0.135] were however found for the STRAP-R
   questionnaire.
   Discussion
             The main goal of this Phase 1 clinical trial was to replicate previous findings showing a
   reduction in subjective cocaine cravings associated with repeated tDCS over the dlPFC in
   individuals with CUD living in an inpatient drug-rehabilitation facility (Batista et al., 2015). Using
   a portable device in such a non-medical setting, our study also aimed at assessing the feasibility of
   an extended protocol of 15 repeated sessions of tDCS. Feasibility was clearly evident in the
   completion of all 15 sessions in 14 of the 17 subjects who started this study (82% retention rate);
   future studies need to take into account drop-outs driven by subjects’ transfer to different treatment
                                                                                                                                     16

   facilities that may not allow participation in research-related activities. Beyond treatment-as-usual
   effects evident in longer abstinence duration, enhanced perceived quality of the environment and
   sleep measures, and in reduced impulsivity, our main finding provided partial support for the
   impact of real-tDCS on reducing craving. Importantly, we observed decreased self-reported
   daytime sleepiness and increased readiness to change in the real-tDCS group only. The real-tDCS
   effect on sleepiness was not maintained after a one-month follow-up, a result that needs to be tested
   with larger samples.
             Previous findings showed a significant decrease in subjective cocaine craving specifically
   in the real-tDCs group (Batista et al., 2015), bolstered by similar results in individuals using other
   psychostimulants such as methamphetamine and nicotine (Fecteau et al., 2014; Shahbabaie et al.,
   2014, 2018; Hajloo et al., 2019; Martinotti et al., 2019; Alizadehgoradel et al., 2020). Our results
   provide partial support for our main hypothesis for a similar unique effect of real-tDCS on craving
   in our subjects. Using the 5-item Obsessive-Compulsive Cocaine Scale craving subscale (De Wildt
   et al., 2005), the tool used by the previous study, a Group by Time interaction showed a trend
   toward significance when correcting for baseline values and using a one-tailed threshold. For this
   effect to reach significance, 30 individuals with CUD (15 in each group) would need to be enrolled
   in a Phase 2 study. Our other craving measures mainly showed a Time main effect such that
   participants in both groups reported less cravings after vs. before the experiment. This Time effect
   was observed for the self-reported craving intensity item on the Cocaine Selective Severity
   Assessment (Kampman et al., 1998) supported by a significant linear decrease over time in the 15
   daily self-reports of cocaine craving with a similar trend also for the 5-item Cocaine Craving
   Questionnaire (Tiffany et al., 1993). Overall, this decrease in craving for both the study groups can
   be attributed to drawing our sample from treatment-seeking individuals living in an inpatient
   facility, a controlled and structured therapeutic environment. Batista and colleagues (2015) also
                                                                                                                                     17

   reported that only the real-tDCS (and not sham) treatment was associated with a decrease in anxiety
   and depressive symptoms and higher levels in self-reported quality of life (in the psychological and
   environment domains). Consistent with the treatment environment, we observed a significant
   increase in the perception of the quality of the environment in both the real- and sham-tDCS groups,
   while effects for anxiety and depression were not significant, potentially because of insufficient
   statistical power and the need for larger sample sizes. Our results also showed a significant decrease
   in impulsivity with time in inpatient treatment, with both groups better able to value monetary
   reinforcement even if delayed in time (Odum, 2011; Mejía-Cruz et al., 2016). The association
   between impulsivity and craving deserves further exploration especially in light of a recent study
   in patients with alcohol use disorder showing that increased impulsivity was associated with higher
   craving, which, in turn, increased the likelihood of alcohol use in treatment, suggesting that craving
   mediates the relationship between impulsivity and the likelihood to relapse (Coates et al., 2020).
             Our exploratory results showed a specific decrease in self-reported daytime sleepiness,
   suggesting an increase in alertness that is characteristic of initial abstinence (Conroy & Arnedt,
   2014), only in the real-tDCS (and not sham) group. Although the Group by Time interaction did
   not reach significance in this small sample, the daily measures of sleep quantity showed similar
   effects such that the real-tDCS group reported sleeping on average more hours than the sham-tDCS
   group, an effect reaching significance in later sessions only (starting at the fifth session), suggesting
   a cumulative effect of real-tDCS on sleep quantity. The seemingly contradictory significant Time
   effect on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, where both groups reported a decrease in sleep quality
   after all tDCS sessions, could reflect the inpatient conditions where subjects share bedrooms similar
   to dormitories with no possibility for individual adjustments (e.g., in sleep/wake cycle). Overall,
   our results are consistent with other tDCS studies targeting the dlPFC with different electrode
   setups (left dlPFC anodal electrode and single or multiple cathodal electrodes throughout the scalp)
                                                                                                                                     18

   in sleep-quality, e.g., in euthymic bipolar patients (Minichino et al., 2014). The exact mechanisms
   underlying the putative effect of tDCS on sleep are yet to be fully investigated but of note is an
   alteration of resting-state functional MRI connectivity between the default mode network and
   subcortical regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus,
   after high-definition tDCS in older adults (Sheng et al., 2018), known for their crucial role in sleep-
   wake functions (Pace-Schott & Hobson, 2002; Sämann et al., 2011; De Havas et al., 2012).
             In addition, participants in the real-tDCS but not sham-tDCS group reported a higher
   motivation to change as measured by the Contemplation Ladder after (vs. before) all 15 sessions.
   Motivation to change is an inherent part of drug rehabilitation, associated with engagement in
   recovery-oriented behaviors (Gregoire & Burke, 2004) and predictive of changes in drug
   consumption (Heather et al., 1993). During a recent functional MRI reappraisal task performed by
   cocaine addicted individual, readiness to change was positively correlated with the right dlPFC
   response to emotional regulation and negatively with its response to emotional processing,
   prompting the authors to propose that a greater top-down control of negative emotionality and
   reactivity is associated with maintaining goal-oriented behaviors (Contreras-Rodríguez et al.,
   2020). It is therefore possible that our tDCS protocol that targeted the right dlPFC enhanced
   subjects’ motivation to change through a top-down executive control mechanism, potentially
   contributing to both the persistence towards reducing drug use and the ability to flexibly learn
   alternatives to current strategies for maintaining abstinence, consistent with the iRISA model
   (Volkow et al., 2010; Goldstein & Volkow, 2011; Hobkirk et al., 2019) as remains to be studied
   with objective measures.

             This iRISA syndrome is associated with enhanced attribution of salience to drug-related
   cues and with decreased sensitivity to non-drug reinforcers; we therefore evaluated the effects of
   tDCS on self-reported sensitivity to reinforcement of addictive and other primary rewards using
   the STRAP-R questionnaire. Although we did not observe significant Time or Group interactions,
   suggesting this sensitivity may mostly reflect trait measures not affected by tDCS, we corroborated
   previous results where the subjective value of drug and non-drug reinforcers depended on the
   situation (Goldstein et al., 2010). More precisely, individuals with CUD gave a higher “liking”
   than “wanting” ratings in all situations (“current”, “in general” and “under the influence”) for non-
   drug reinforcers (food and sex) whereas they exhibited more drug “wanting” than “liking” when
   reporting about being “under the influence”. These results support the idea that drug stimuli are
   wanted (potentially underlying habit and compulsion) more than they are liked (hedonic properties)
   especially during a drug-cue context in addiction (Goldstein & Volkow, 2002, 2011; Goldstein et
   al., 2010).
             A major limitation of this study is its small sample size (especially during the follow-up
   assessment), potentially reducing statistical power by increased interindividual variability
   characterizing the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation on cortical plasticity (Ridding &
   Ziemann, 2010; López-Alonso et al., 2014). Another limitation is the use of self-report to assess
   craving, which could reflect habituation and/or floor or other effects (e.g., compromised self-
   awareness). A Phase 2 clinical trial should include more participants in each group as well as
   objective measures of cocaine craving such as drug-related cue-reactivity (e.g., assessed by
   electroencephalography and event-related potentials), which may be more sensitive to our effects
   of interest. Indeed, these objective measures tracked cue-induced incubation of craving, showing a
   discrepancy with subjective measures of cocaine craving during abstinence in individuals with
   CUD (Parvaz et al., 2016). Our study suggests only a transient effect of tDCS on sleepiness and
                                                                                                                                     20

   craving when tested about one month after the last tDCS session. Further studies are needed to
   establish the tDCS dose and duration needed for optimally maintaining any beneficial impact in
   inpatients with CUD. Finally, the impact of medications (taken by all our participants) on results
   remains to be systematically studied. Some studies suggest that pharmacotherapy in combination
   with electrical brain stimulation yield greater effects (than brain stimulation or pharmacotherapy
   alone) in depression (Brunoni et al., 2013, 2014), although other studies suggest no significant
   effects of pharmacotherapy on decreasing craving, observed in both the experimental and control
   groups after 10 sessions of repeated tDCS in inpatients with CUD (Klauss et al., 2018).
             To summarize, our study in individuals with CUD showed a trend towards a unique effect
   of real-tDCS on craving, an effect that could reach significance with 15 subjects per group. In this
   small sample, inpatient treatment itself, and the ensuing longer abstinence, was associated with a
   reduction in self-reported craving and improvements in the perceived quality of the environment
   as well as with reduced impulsivity/improvements in valuation of delayed rewards (but not with
   changes in the value attributed to drug-related rewards especially when thinking about a drug-
   relevant context). Interestingly, real-tDCS (but not sham-tDCS) was associated with reductions in
   daytime sleepiness and increases in readiness to change potentially suggesting the fortification of
   executive cognitive functions supported by the dlPFC. A main result from this Phase 1 project was
   also the demonstration of the feasibility of using a portable tDCS device 15 times over 5 weeks in
   inpatients with CUD. Overall, our results suggest the need for extending this proof-of-concept
   study to establish the use of tDCS as an add-on therapy in drug addiction. Specifically, these results
   call for a larger sample further incorporating objective (e.g., psychophysiological) outcome
   measures and ultimately assessing the remote and self-administration of tDCS (e.g., in other in-
   and out-patient drug rehabilitation facilities, in combination with other cognitive and
                                                                                                                                     21

   Group-averaged total scores on all measures that showed significant Group × Time interactions
   and for all outcome variables that showed a significant Time effect (or a trend) for all three study
   timepoints (pre-tDCS, post-tDCS, and follow-up). Those measures were the 5-item OCCS craving
   subscale (A), 5-item Cocaine Cravings Questionnaire (B), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (C),
   Contemplation Ladder (D), the Environment domain of the abbreviated version of the World
   Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire (E), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (F).
   A Group × Time interaction on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was driven by a time effect only in
   the real-tDCS group such that participants reported more sleepiness at follow-up when compared
   to the immediate post-tDCS assessment (** p < 0.01). A significant Group effect was found for the
   5-item OCCS craving subscale when correcting for baseline values where the real-tDCS group
   showed lower cravings than the sham-tDCS group (p < 0.05). A significant Time effect was also
   found for the Environment domain of the Quality of Life questionnaire (p < 0.05).
