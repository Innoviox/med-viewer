    Structured Abstract
    Objective: Determine age-specific infection fatality rates for COVID-19 to inform
    public health policies and communications that help protect vulnerable age groups.
    Methods: Studies of COVID-19 prevalence were collected by conducting an online search of
    published articles, preprints, and government reports. A total of 120 studies were reviewed in
    depth and screened, of which 34 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the
    meta-analysis. Age-specific IFRs were computed using the prevalence data in conjunction with
    reported fatalities four weeks after the midpoint date of the study, reflecting typical lags in
    fatalities and reporting. Meta-regression procedures in Stata were used to analyze IFR by age.
    Results: Our analysis finds a exponential relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19.
    The estimated age-specific IFRs are very low for children and younger adults but increase
    progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. We find that
    differences in the age structure of the population and the age-specific prevalence of COVID-19
    explain about 90% of the geographical variation in population IFR.
    Discussion: These results indicate that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also
    for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate is two orders of magnitude greater
    than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal
    influenza. Moreover, the overall IFR for COVID-19 should not be viewed as a fixed parameter
    but as intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. Consequently, public health
    measures to mitigate infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths.

    Introduction
    Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in winter 2020, it has been evident that the severity
    of the disease varies markedly across infected individuals.[1, 2] Some remain asymptomatic
    throughout the course of infection or experience only mild symptoms such as headache or
    ageusia, whereas others experience much more severe illness, hospitalization, or even death.
    Thus, official case reporting may tend to encompass a high fraction of severe cases but only a
    small fraction of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Moreover, the availability of live
    virus tests has varied significantly across locations and over time, and the deployment of such
    tests may differ markedly across demographic groups.
    Consequently, assessments of the case fatality rate (CFR), the ratio of deaths to reported cases,
    are fraught with pitfalls in gauging the severity of COVID-19. For example, early case reports
    from Wuhan noted a preponderance of older people among hospital admissions and a high CFR.
    Subsequent studies have documented that children and young adults tend to exhibit fewer and
    milder symptoms and a far lower CFR. Nonetheless, the link between age and severity of
    COVID-19 infections has remained unclear for the reasons noted above.
    To provide more accurate assessments of the spread of COVID-19, researchers have conducted
    seroprevalence studies in numerous locations. Such studies analyze samples of serum to detect
    antibodies in those infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Seroprevalence
    results can be used to estimate the infection fatality rate (IFR), the ratio of fatalities to total
    infections, thereby facilitating the identification of vulnerable segments of the population and
    informing key policy decisions aimed at mitigating the consequences of the pandemic.
    For example, as shown in Table 1, the New York Department of Health conducted a large-scale
    seroprevalence study and estimated about 1·6 million SARS-CoV-2 infections among the 8
    million residents of New York City.[3] However, only one-tenth of those infections were
    captured in reported COVID-19 cases, about one-fourth of which required hospitalization, and a
    substantial fraction of cases had fatal outcomes.[4] All told, COVID-19 fatalities in NYC
    represented a tenth of reported cases but only one-hundredth of all SARS-CoV-2 infections.
    Nonetheless, divergences in study design and reporting have hampered comparisons of
    seroprevalence and IFRs across locations and demographic groups. For example, a number of
    studies have analyzed a representative sample of the general population, while other studies have
    made use of “convenience samples” of residual sera collected for other purposes (such as
    laboratory tests or blood donations). Some studies have simply reported results for raw
    prevalence (the fraction of seropositive results), whereas other studies have reported results
    adjusted for antibody test characteristics (sensitivity and specificity).
    While the NYC data indicate an IFR of about 1%, seroprevalence estimates from other locations
    have yielded a wide array of IFR estimates, ranging from about 0·6% in Geneva to levels
    exceeding 2% in northern Italy. Such estimates have fueled intense controversy about the

    severity of COVID-19 and the appropriate design of public health measures to contain it, which
    in turn hinges on whether the hazards of this disease are mostly limited to the elderly and infirm.
    Indeed, a recent meta-analysis noted the high degree of heterogeneity across aggregate estimates
    of IFR and concluded that research on age-stratified IFR is “urgently needed to inform
    policymaking.”[5]
    This paper reports on a systematic review and meta-analysis of age-specific IFRs for COVID-19.
    We specifically consider the hypothesis that the observed variation in IFR across locations may
    primarily reflect the age specificity of COVID-19 infections and fatalities. Based on these
    findings, we are able to assess and contextualize the severity of COVID-19 and examine how
    age-specific prevalence affects the population IFR and the total incidence of fatalities.
    Methodology
    To perform the present meta-analysis, we collected published papers and preprints on the
    seroprevalence and/or infection fatality rate of COVID-19 that were publicly disseminated prior
    to 18 September 2020. As described in Supplementary Appendix B, we systematically performed
    online searches in MedRxiv, Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar, and EMBASE, and we
    identified other studies listed in reports by government institutions such as the U.K. Parliament
    Office.[6] Data was extracted from studies by three authors and verified prior to inclusion.
    We restricted our meta-analysis to studies of advanced economies, based on current membership
    in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in light of the distinct
    challenges of health care provision and reporting of fatalities in developing economies.[7] We
    also excluded studies aimed at measuring prevalence in specific groups such as health care
    workers.
    Our meta-analysis encompasses two distinct approaches for assessing the prevalence of
    COVID-19: (1) seroprevalence studies that test for antibodies produced in response to the virus,
    and (2) comprehensive tracing programs using extensive live-virus testing of everyone who has
    had contact with a potentially infected individual. Seroprevalence estimates are associated with
    uncertainty related to the sensitivity and specificity of the test method and the extent to which the
    sampling frame provides an accurate representation of prevalence in the general population; see
    Supplementary Appendix C. Prevalence measures from comprehensive tracing programs are
    associated with uncertainty about the extent of inclusion of infected individuals, especially those
    who are asymptomatic.
    Sampling frame
    To assess prevalence in the general population, a study should be specifically designed to utilize
    a random sample using standard survey procedures such as stratification and weighting by
    demographic characteristics. Other sampling frames may be useful for specific purposes such as

                                                                       3
    sentinel surveillance but not well-suited for assessing prevalence due to substantial risk of
    systemic bias. Consequently, our meta-analysis excludes the following types of studies:
        •    Blood Donors. Only a small fraction of blood donors are ages 60 and above—a
             fundamental limitation in assessing COVID-19 prevalence and IFRs for older age
             groups—and the social behavior of blood donors may be systematically different from
             their peers.[8, 9] These concerns can be directly investigated by comparing alternative
             seroprevalence surveys of the same geographical location. As of early June, Public
             Health England (PHE) reported seroprevalence of 8·5% based on specimens from blood
             donors, whereas the U.K. Office of National Statistics (ONS) reported markedly lower
             seroprevalence of 5·4% (CI: 4·3–6·5%) based on its monitoring of a representative
             sample of the English population.[10, 11]
        •    Dialysis Centers. Assessing seroprevalence of dialysis patients using residual sera
             collected at dialysis centers is crucial for gauging the infection risks faced by these
             individuals, of which a disproportionately high fraction tend to be underrepresented
             minorities. Nonetheless, the seroprevalence within this group may be markedly different
             from that of the general population. For example, a study of U.K. dialysis patients found
             seroprevalence of about 36%, several times higher than that obtained using a very large
             random sample of the English population.[12, 13] Similarly, a recent U.S. study found a
             seropositive rate of 34% for dialysis patients in New York state that was more than twice
             as high as the seroprevalence in a random sample of New York residents.[3, 14]
        •    Hospitals and Urgent Care Clinics. Estimates of seroprevalence among current medical
             patients are subject to substantial bias, as evident from a pair of studies conducted in
             Tokyo, Japan: One study found 41 positive cases among 1071 urgent care clinic patients,
             whereas the other study found only two confirmed positive results in a random sample of
             nearly 2000 Tokyo residents (seroprevalence estimates of 3·8% vs. 0·1%).[15, 16]
        •    Active Recruitment. Soliciting participants is particularly problematic in contexts of low
             prevalence, because seroprevalence can be markedly affected by a few individuals who
             volunteer due to concerns about prior exposure. For example, a Luxembourg study
             obtained positive antibody results for 35 out of 1,807 participants, but nearly half of those
             individuals (15 of 35) had previously had a positive live virus test, were residing in a
             household with someone who had a confirmed positive test, or had direct contact with
             someone else who had been infected.[17]
    Our critical review has also underscored the pitfalls of seroprevalence studies based on
    “convenience samples” of residual sera collected for other purposes. For example, two studies
    assessed seroprevalence of Utah residents during spring 2020. The first study analyzed residual
    sera from two commercial laboratories and obtained a prevalence estimate of 2·2% (CI: 1·2–
    3·4%), whereas the second study collected specimens from a representative sample and obtained

                                                                       4
    a markedly lower prevalence estimate of 0·96% (CI: 0·4–1·8%).[18, 19] In light of these issues,
    our meta-analysis includes residual serum studies but we flag such studies as having an elevated
    risk of bias.
    Comprehensive Tracing Programs
    Our meta-analysis incorporates data on COVID-19 prevalence and fatalities in countries that
    have consistently maintained comprehensive tracing programs since the early stages of the
    pandemic. Such a program was only feasible in places where public health officials could
    conduct repeated tests of potentially infected individuals and trace those whom they had direct
    contact. We identify such countries using a threshold of 300 for the ratio of cumulative tests to
    reported cases as of 30 April 2020, based on comparisons of prevalence estimates and reported
    cases in Czech Republic, Korea, and Iceland; see Supplementary Appendices D and E.[20]
    Studies of Iceland and Korea found that estimated prevalence was moderately higher than the
    number of reported cases, especially for younger age groups; hence we make corresponding
    adjustments for other countries with comprehensive tracing programs, and we identify these
    estimates as subject to an elevated risk of bias.[21-23]
    Measurement of fatalities
    Accurately measuring total deaths is a substantial issue in assessing IFR due to time lags from
    onset of symptoms to death and from death to official reporting. Symptoms typically develop
    within 6 days after exposure but may develop as early as 2 days or as late as 14 days.[1, 24]
    More than 95% of symptomatic COVID patients have positive antibody (IgG) titres within 17-19
    days of symptom onset, and those antibodies remain elevated over a sustained period.[25-28]
    The mean time interval from symptom onset to death is 15 days for ages 18–64 and 12 days for
    ages 65+, with interquartile ranges of 9–24 days and 7–19 days, respectively, while the mean
    interval from date of death to the reporting of that person’s death is about 7 days with an IQR of
    2–19 days; thus, the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval between symptom onset and
    reporting of fatalities is about six weeks (41 days).[29]
    Figure 1 illustrates these findings in a hypothetical scenario where the pandemic was curtailed
    two weeks prior to the date of the seroprevalence study. This figure shows the results of a
    simulation calibrated to reflect the estimated distribution for time lags between symptom onset,
    death, and inclusion in official fatality reports. The histogram shows the frequency of deaths
    and reported fatalities associated with the infections that occurred on the last day prior to full
    containment. Consistent with the confidence intervals noted above, 95% of cumulative fatalities
    are reported within roughly four weeks of the date of the seroprevalence study.
    As shown in Table 2, the precise timing of the count of cumulative fatalities is relatively
    innocuous in locations where the outbreak had been contained for more than a month prior to the
    date of the seroprevalence study. By contrast, in instances where the outbreak had only recently

                                                                       5
    been contained, the death count continued rising markedly for several more weeks after the
    midpoint of the seroprevalence study.
    Therefore, we construct age-specific IFRs using the seroprevalence data in conjunction with
    cumulative fatalities four weeks after the midpoint date of each study; see Supplementary
    Appendix F. We have also conducted sensitivity analysis using cumulative fatalities five weeks
    after the midpoint date, and we flag studies as having an elevated risk of bias if the change in
    cumulative fatalities between weeks 4 and 5 exceeds 10%.
    By contrast, matching prevalence estimates with subsequent fatalities is not feasible if a
    seroprevalence study was conducted in the midst of an accelerating outbreak. Therefore, our
    meta-analysis excludes seroprevalence studies for which the change in cumulative fatalities from
    week 0 to week 4 exceeds 200%.
    Metaregression procedure
    To analyze IFR by age, we use meta-regression with random effects, using the meta regress
    procedure in Stata v16.[30, 31] We used a random-effects procedures to allow for residual
    heterogeneity between studies and across age groups by assuming that these divergences are
    drawn from a Gaussian distribution. Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s regression and
    the trim-and-fill method. See Supplementary Appendix G for further details.
    Results
    After an initial screening of 1153 studies, we reviewed the full texts of 120 studies, of which
    54 studies were excluded due to lack of age-specific data on COVID-19 prevalence or
    fatalities.[11, 15, 16, 28, 32-81] Seroprevalence estimates for two locations were excluded
    because the outbreak was still accelerating during the period when the specimens were being
    collected and from two other locations for which age-specific seroprevalence was not
    distinguishable from zero.[18, 82-84] Studies of non-representative samples were excluded as
    follows: 13 studies of blood donors; 5 studies of patients of hospitals, outpatient clinics, and
    dialysis centers; 4 studies with active recruitment of participants, and 6 narrow sample groups
    such as elementary schools.[10, 14, 16, 17, 82, 85-107] Supplementary Appendix H lists all
    excluded studies.
    Consequently, our meta-analysis encompasses 34 studies, of which 28 are included in our
    metaregression and 6 are used for out-of-sample analysis. The metaregression studies can
    be categorized into three distinct groups:
        •    Representative samples from studies of England, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands,
             Portugal, Spain, Geneva (Switzerland), and four U.S. locations (Atlanta, Indiana,
             New York, and Salt Lake City).[3, 13, 19, 108-117]

        •    Convenience samples from studies of Belgium, Sweden, Ontario (Canada),
             and eight U.S. locations (Connecticut, Louisiana, Miami, Minneapolis, Missouri,
             Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Seattle).[18, 118-120]
        •    Comprehensive tracing programs for Australia, Iceland, Korea, Lithuania, and
             New Zealand.[121-125]
    The metaregression includes results from the very large REACT-2 seroprevalence study of the
    English population.[13] Thus, to avoid pitfalls of nested or overlapping samples, two other
    somewhat smaller studies conducted by U.K. Biobank and the U.K. Office of National Statistics
    are not included in the metaregression but are instead used in out-of-sample analysis of the
    metaregression results.[11, 126] Similarly, the metaregression includes two large-scale studies
    involving representative samples from three French provinces and from Salt Lake City, and
    hence two other studies using convenience samples from laboratories in France and in Utah are
    used in the out-of-sample analysis along with two other small-scale studies.[18, 19, 127-129]
    Data taken from included studies is shown in Supplementary Appendix I. Supplementary
    Appendix J assesses the risk of bias for each individual study. As indicated in Supplementary
    Appendix K, no publication bias was found using Egger’s test (p > 0.10), and the trim-and-fill
    method produced the same estimate as the metaregression.
    We obtain the following metaregression results:
                                        𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙10 (𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼) = −3.27               + 0.0524 ∗ 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎
                                                                   (0.07)           (0.0013)
    where the standard error for each estimated coefficient is given in parentheses. These estimates
    are highly significant with t-statistics of -44·5 and 40·4, respectively, and p-values below
    0·0001. The residual heterogeneity τ2 = 0·071 (p-value < 0.0001) and I2 = 97·0, confirming that
    the random effects are essential for capturing unexplained variations across studies and age
    groups. The adjusted R2 is 94·7%.
    As noted above, the validity of this metaregression rests on the condition that the data are
    consistent with a Gaussian distribution. The validity of that assumption is evident in Figure 3:
    Nearly all of the observations fall within the 95% prediction interval of the metaregression, and
    the remainder are moderate outliers.
    This specification of the metaregression also assumes that the intercept and slope parameters are
    stable across the entire age distribution. We have confirmed the validity of that assumption by
    estimating alternative specifications in which the parameters are allowed to differ between three
    distinct age categories (ages 0–34, 35–59, and 60+ years). The estimated parameters are similar
    across all three age categories, and the null hypothesis of parameter constancy is consistent with
    the metaregression data (see Supplementary Appendix L).
    Figure 4 depicts the exponential relationship between age and the level of IFR in percent, and
    Figure 5 shows the corresponding forest plot. Evidently, the SARS-CoV-2 virus poses a

    substantial mortality risk for middle-aged adults and even higher risks for elderly people: The
    IFR is very low for children and young adults but rises to 0·4% at age 55, 1·4% at age 65,
    4·6% at age 75, 15% at age 85, and exceeds 25% for ages 90 and above. These metaregression
    predictions are well aligned with the out-of-sample IFRs; see Supplementary Appendix M.
    As shown in Figure 6, the metaregression explains nearly 90% of the geographical variation in
    population IFR, which ranges from about 0·5% in Salt Lake City and Geneva to 1·5% in
    Australia and England and 2·7% in Italy. The metaregression explains this variation in terms of
    differences in the age structure of the population and age-specific prevalence of COVID-19.
    Discussion
    The IFR is central to our understanding of the public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
    and the appropriate policies for mitigating those consequences. In the absence of effective
    therapies or vaccines, such policies will primarily involve non-pharmaceutical interventions
    (NPIs). NPIs may include relatively mild measures (such as prohibitions on large gatherings) or
    more draconian restrictions such as shelter-in-place edicts, popularly known as “lockdowns.”
    Unfortunately, public debate on these issues has been hampered by diverging assessments of the
    severity of COVID-19. For example, some early seroprevalence studies (using relatively small
    and non-representative samples, often in areas of low prevalence) yielded miniscule estimates of
    population IFR similar to those of seasonal influenza. Such estimates implied that strict NPIs
    would be completely irrational given the limited benefits and severe economic and social costs.
    With the dissemination of many more seroprevalence studies over recent months, a wide array of
    hypotheses have been mooted to explain the diverging implications for IFR, including regional
    variations in the quality of treatment or the extent of T-cell immunity to other betacoronaviruses.
    By contrast, our critical review identifies the key characteristics of seroprevalence studies that
    can be used to provide reliable assessments of IFR. Indeed, once we focus on this group of
    studies (which includes nine national seroprevalence studies), our metaregression reveals a
    remarkably high degree of consistency in the implications for age-specific IFR. Moreover, our
    results indicate that most of the variation in population IFR across locations reflects differences
    in the extent to which vulnerable age groups were exposed to the virus.
    One key implication of our findings is that the incidence of fatalities from a COVID-19 outbreak
    depends crucially on the age groups that are infected, which in turn reflects the age structure of
    that population and the extent to which public health measures limit the incidence of infections
    among vulnerable age groups. Indeed, even if an outbreak is mainly concentrated among
    younger people, it may be very difficult to prevent the virus from spreading among older adults.
    To illustrate the benefits of age-stratified public health strategies for COVID-19, we have
    constructed a set of three scenarios for the U.S. trajectory of infections and fatalities (see
    Supplementary Appendix N). Each scenario assumes that U.S. prevalence rises to a plateau of

                                                                       8
    around 20% but with different patterns of age-specific prevalence. In particular, if prevalence
    becomes uniform across age groups, this analysis projects that total U.S. fatalities would exceed
    500 thousand and that population IFR would converge to around 0·8%. By contrast, a scenario
    with relatively low incidence of new infections among vulnerable age groups would be
    associated with less than half as many deaths and a much lower population IFR of about 0·3%.
    A further implication of our results is that the risks of infection to the middle aged cannot be
    neglected. This is important for pandemic management strategies that aim to avoid large influxes
    of patients to healthcare. Indeed, it is likely that an unmitigated outbreak among adults over 35
    years old could have severe consequences on the healthcare system. Table 3 contextualizes this
    issue by comparing the age-specific IFRs from our meta-regression analysis to the annualized
    risks of fatal automobile accidents or other unintentional injuries in England and in the United
    States.[130, 131] For example, an English person aged 55–64 years who gets infected with
    SARS-CoV-2 faces a fatality risk that is more than 200 times higher than the annual risk of
    dying in a fatal car accident. These results also confirm that COVID-19 is far more deadly than
    seasonal flu, for which the population IFR is about 0·05% (see Supplementary Appendix O).
    Moreover, seasonal influenza outbreaks are limited by prior immunity, whereas that is not the
    case for SARS-CoV-2.
    Our critical review highlights the benefits of assessing prevalence using large-scale studies of
    representative samples of the general population rather than convenience samples of blood
    donors or medical patients. Conducting such studies on an ongoing basis will enable public
    health officials to monitor changes in prevalence among vulnerable age groups and gauge the
    efficacy of public policy measures. Moreover, such studies enable researchers to assess the
    extent to which antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 may gradually diminish over time as well as the
    extent to which advances in treatment facilitate the reduction of age-specific IFRs.
    Our critical review also underscores the importance of methodological issues in assessing IFR.
    For example, the raw prevalence results reported by a national study of Italy would imply a
    population IFR of about 2·3%, whereas test-adjusted prevalence implies a substantially higher
    IFR of 2·7%. Likewise, a few recent studies have excluded all deaths occurring in nursing homes
    and retirement communities and have obtained estimates of population IFR that are markedly
    lower than our estimates based on all confirmed COVID-19 fatalities, whereas assessments of
    IFR based on measures of excess mortality are broadly similar to our estimates.[110, 132-134]
    See Supplementary Appendix P for further discussion.
    Our metaregression results are broadly consistent with the study of Verity et al. (2020), which
    was completed at a very early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and characterized an
    exponential pattern of age-specific IFRs (see Supplementary Appendix Q).[135] Our results are
    also well-aligned with a more recent meta-analysis of population IFR; indeed, our age-specific
    analysis explains a very high proportion of the dispersion in population IFRs highlighted by that
    study.[5] In contrast, our findings are markedly different from those of an earlier review of

                                                                       9
    population IFR, mostly due to differences in selection criteria.[136] Finally, the exponential
    pattern of our age-specific IFR estimates is qualitatively similar to that of age-specific CFRs but
    the magnitudes are systematically different (see Supplementary Appendix R).
    A potential concern about measuring IFR based on seroprevalence is that antibody titers
    may diminish over time, leading to underestimation of true prevalence and corresponding
    overestimation of IFR, especially for locations where the seroprevalence study was conducted
    several months after the outbreak had been contained. However, a key feature of our
    metaregression analysis is that we also utilize age-specific IFR data based on RT-PCR results
    (not seroprevalence) for five countries that have maintained comprehensive tracing programs
    since the onset of the pandemic, namely, Australia, Iceland, Korea, Lithuania, and New Zealand.
    As shown in figure 3, the age-specific IFRs for those five countries are well aligned with the
    metaregression predictions, indicating that these findings do not rely upon any specific method
    of gauging prevalence.
    A substantial limitation of our work is that we have not considered factors apart from age that
    affect the IFR of COVID-19. For example, a recent U.K. study found that mortality outcomes are
    strongly linked to specific comorbidities such as diabetes and obesity but did not resolve the
    question of whether those links reflect differences in prevalence or causal effects on IFR.[137]
    See Supplementary Appendix S for additional evidence. Likewise, we have not considered the
    extent to which IFRs may vary with other demographic factors such as race and ethnicity or
    potential causal interactions between these factors.[32, 61] Further research on these issues is
    clearly warranted.
    It should also be noted that our analysis has focused exclusively on the incidence of fatalities but
    has not captured the full spectrum of adverse health consequences of COVID-19, some of which
    may be severe and persistent. Further research is needed to assess age-stratified rates of
    hospitalization as well as longer-term sequelae attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections. These
    factors are likely to be particularly important in quantifying risks to health care.
    In summary, our meta-analysis demonstrates that COVID-19 is not only dangerous for the
    elderly and infirm but also for healthy middle-aged adults. The metaregression explains nearly
    90% of the geographical variation in population IFR, indicating that the population IFR is
    intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. Consequently, public health
    measures to protect vulnerable age groups could substantially reduce the incidence of mortality.

    Note: This table compares IFRs for COVID-19 with the incidence of accidental deaths in
    England and in the USA. For each age group, the second column shows the metaregression
    estimate of the age-specific IFR with its 95% confidence interval enclosed in parentheses. The
    final four columns report the annual incidence of automobile fatalities and other accidental
    fatalities as a percent of the population of each age group in each country. The accidental fatality
    data for England as of 2019 is reported by the U.K. Office of National Statistics, while the
    corresponding U.S. data are reported as of 2018 by the U.S. National Center for Health
    Statistics.[130, 131]

          Figure 1: Time lags in the incidence and reporting of COVID-19 fatalities
    Note: This figure illustrates time lags in the incidence and reporting of COVID-19 fatalities using
    the results of a simulation calibrated to reflect the estimated distribution for time lags between
    symptom onset, death, and inclusion in official fatality reports.[29] As indicated by the vertical
    green line, this simulation assumes that the seroprevalence study was conducted two weeks after
    the pandemic was curtailed. The histogram shows the frequency of deaths and reported fatalities
    associated with the infections that occurred on the last day prior to full containment. As indicated
    by the orange vertical line, 95% of cumulative fatalities are reported within about four weeks
    after the midpoint date of the seroprevalence study.

      Figure 3: The log-linear relationship between IFR and age
    Note: Our metaregression indicates that the infection fatality rate (IFR) increases exponentially
    with age, and hence this figure uses a base-10 logarithmic scale so that the relationship is evident
    across all ages from 5 to 95 years. Each marker denotes a specific metaregression observation,
    that is, the IFR for a particular age group in a particular location. The marker style reflects the
    type of observation: circles for observations from seroprevalence studies of representative
    samples, diamonds for seroprevalence studies of convenience samples, and squares for countries
    with comprehensive tracing programs. The red line denotes the metaregression estimate of IFR
    as a function of age, the shaded region depicts the 95% confidence interval for that estimate.
    The dashed lines denote the prediction interval (which includes random variations across studies
    and age groups), and almost all of the 108 metaregression observations lie within that interval.

      Figure 6: Variations in population IFR across geographical locations
    Note: This figure depicts the extent to which the metaregression results account for variations in
    population IFR across geographical locations. The blue circles denote seroprevalence studies of
    representative samples, and the green diamonds denote countries with comprehensive tracing
    programs. For each observation, its position on the horizontal axis denotes its predicted IFR
    obtained by aggregating across the age-specific predictions of the metaregression, and its
    position on the vertical axis denotes the actual population IFR for that location. The dashed
    segments denote the estimated line obtained by fitting a regression to these 16 observations.
    The R2 of this regression is 0.87, indicating that nearly 90% of the variation in population IFR
    can be explained by variations in age composition and age-specific prevalence of COVID-19.
