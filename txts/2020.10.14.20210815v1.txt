                Sociodemographic correlates of access to sanitary pads among college
                        students in Lucknow during COVID 19 lockdown
           Abstract
           Introduction
           Sanitary napkin is an essential aspect of the Menstrual management materials for women and
           adolescent girls between menarche and menopause. Despite being an important issue
           concerning women and girls in the menstruating age group, access to menstrual hygiene
           products neglected during the COVID19 pandemic. Further, there is no evidence of the
           practice of menstrual hygiene products in Indian settings during this period. This paper
           investigates the prevalence of socio-demographic correlations of access to sanitary napkins
           among college students in Lucknow.
           Methods
           An online retrospective cross-sectional survey was conducted in Lucknow in September
           2020. In total, 1439 participants took part in the survey. After removing 55 participants, those
           quit the survey by clicking on the disagree button and 13 were not satisfying inclusion
           criteria. So the final samples were 1371, which were included in the analysis. Students of UG
           and PG currently studying in colleges in the Lucknow were eligible to participate. The data
           collection was anonymous. Responses were analysed using descriptive and bivariate logistic
           regression.
           Results
           In this study, 1371 students were included, making a response rate of 96.2 percent. Nearly
           12.5 percent of students reported about difficulty encountered during the lockdown. Muslims,
           Father education illiterate or upto12th, father occupation as farmer, monthly salary less than
           25 thousand, residence as rural, and history of reusable clothes were more likely to face
           problems to access sanitary pads during the lockdown in Lucknow (P < .05).
           Conclusions
           During COVID-19 lockdown, about 12.5 % of girls were dependent on either locally
           available resources as absorbents during menstruation or paid more to access in Lucknow.
           Because of the lockdown, many people have lost their livelihood. More than ever,
           economically low-income families are reluctant to spend on sanitary pads, which is why few
           college girls were going back to their previous handling periods by using rags.

           Introduction
           It is a well-established fact that the COVID-19 and lockdown affected economically (1) and
           psychosocially (2) to all segments of the population adversely. Especially vulnerable groups,
           including people living below the poverty line, differently-abled people, women, children,
           elderly and migrant workers (3). Healthcare, a fundamental human right, also affected (4)
           because, it affected routine healthcare services due to shortages of essential medical supplies
           and health staff (5).
           Across diverse social contexts, the topic of menstruation has often been relegated and it was
           not in priority list of policy makers(6).Global health priorities were aimed only at reducing
           maternal morbidity and mortality, and the problematic feminization of the HIV epidemic(7).
           Reason was because of menstrual shame and the complexities of menstrual management
           were perceived as an inevitable part of the social order, and other priorities for the limited
           existing resources consumed more attention(6).
           However, now menstrual hygiene management (MHM) is one of globally recognized public
           health issue(6) which was also affected during COVID19 lockdown and made menstruating
           females one of vulnerable groups, because menstruation is a biological processes and do not
           cease during lockdown. With the sudden closure of campuses worldwide , many female
           students faced challenges to manage menstrual hygiene practices confined at home(8). The
           COVID-19 lockdown crisis was presented with even more difficulties in accessing menstrual
           hygiene products (9) in India, because it is not a socially discoursed area. There were lack of
           availability of sanitary pads (10), which facilitate personal hygiene, and dispose of its waste,
           which required adequate privacy(11). During lockdown around 58 per cent of the small and
           medium scale manufacturers of sanitary pads were not able to operate fully whereas 37 per
           cent were not operational at all(12).
           Hygiene practices such as the use of sanitary napkins are useful during menstruation to
           protect girls or women health (13). The closure of shops and shutdown of transport means
           less availability and accessibility of menstrual hygiene provisions(14). Further, the lockdown
           was also challenging for women's and girls' access to toilets in presence of male and elder
           family members for managing menstruation (15).
           India went into one of the world's strictest lockdowns from March 25 (16) to May 31 (17),
           extended four times, from June 1 there were gradual relaxations. However, schools and
           colleges are still not open. During the initial phase of the lockdown, sanitary napkins were

           not included in the essential items, later rectified after massive public outrage. That led to a
           shortage and devised many girls and women with no choice but to resort to unhygienic
           practice using old clothes/rags to manage their periods (18).
           Various State governments have a provision in a school-based distribution of sanitary pads
           under a central government programme, Kishori Shakti Yojna. Due to schools' closing down,
           many girls have no access to sanitary pads forced to shift from disposable sanitary pads to
           cloth pads (18).
           A common problem linked to cloth pads is that those who use it do not have adequate
           information on maintaining the cloth they are using so that they are not infected later. Using
           cloth pads without knowing how to keep it poses a danger to a woman's health, and they risk
           infections of a grave nature (19).
           Hygiene-related menstruation practices are essential as these can predispose women to the
           risk of reproductive tract infection (20). For menstruating girls and women, anxiety over
           menstrual hygiene is a key concern. The interplay of socio-economic status, menstrual
           hygiene practices, and RTI are noticeable (21). Women's autonomy, residential status,
           occupation of father, Caste, exposure to mass media, and wealth status found to be the most
           significant positive factors of hygienic menstrual practices (20) (22).
           National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4 (2015 -16) of Uttar Pradesh reported, only 47.1%
           of women (Urban 68.6, Rural 39.9) in the age group of 15 to 24 years use hygienic methods
           of protection during their menstrual period (23). Girls with a higher education level use safe
           menstruation methods compare to less educated girls (24). So, college students better use of
           menstruation hygiene practices than the general women population. A study in Telangana
           reported about 87 % of college students using sanitary pads (25), while a study done in
           Ghana said 100% were using a sanitary pad (26).
           Further, the lack of sanitary products created a sense of isolation and fear (27). In Lebanon,
           69% of adolescent girls were walk long distance to access menstrual pads. Similarly, parents
           of 63% of young girl faced financial hardship to buy menstrual pads. In Uganda, 100% of
           respondents said they were struggling to access menstrual pads (28).
           Menstrual hygiene is an important need of menstruating women and girls. Adolescent girls
           constitute a vulnerable group, particularly in India, where a girl child is neglected and
           discriminated(29). Menstruation is still regarded as something unclean or dirty among Indians
           (21). There is no study on menstrual management materials in India during the COVID-19
           lockdown. Therefore, we conducted this study to know the prevalence of socio-demographic
           correlations of access to sanitary napkins among college students in Lucknow.

           Methods
           Study design and Settings
           A quantitative approach was utilised to achieve the objectives of this study. An online cross-
           sectional survey was most appropriate for gathering information on access to sanitary napkins
           among college students between 11th September 2020 to 25th September 2020.
           Ethical approval
           This work was done in collaboration of Shri Gurunanak Girls Degree College, Lucknow and
           Career Institute of Medical Sciences and Hospital, Lucknow. Ethical approval for this
           research was obtained from the Institutional Review Committee of Career Institute of
           Medical Sciences and Hospital (Ref: PHARMA/SEP/2020/02), Lucknow, India. Participants
           who gave consent to participate in the survey would click the ‘Agree’ button and then be
           directed to complete the self-administered questionnaire.
           Recruitment procedure
           In total, 1439 participants took part in the survey. After removing participants' data with 55
           participants’, the questionnaires quit the survey by clicking on the disagree button and 13 not
           satisfying inclusion criteria. So the final samples were 1371, which were included in the
           analysis. As colleges were closed, it is not feasible to conduct a systematic sampling
           procedure; the researchers opted for Google form platform as an online survey. Students of
           UG and PG currently studying in colleges in the Lucknow were eligible to participate. We
           utilised several strategies to reach as many respondents as possible all over the Lucknow
           within the two-week data collection period. This includes relying on the researchers'
           professional and personal networks to share the survey. WhatsApp was selected as the most
           popular communication and social platform during online teaching in colleges in Lucknow.
           Every college made a student's group for communication-related to course instruction and
           notice. A description about the survey was given in the WhatsApp message postings before
           the link was provided to both English and Hindi language versions of the questionnaire.
           Measures
           Outcome variables
           Students were asked the following question: Did you face difficulties to access sanitary pads during
           lockdown? Response were recorded in No=0 and Yes=1. Further additional open question was also
           asked about alternative method used during that time.
           Independent variable
           We examined the distribution of this variable with a range of independent variables that have
           been suggested in the literature to predict menstrual absorbent precisely: Class of

           residence(Rural and Urban) and history of reusable cloth use( No and Yes).
           Statistical analysis
           For this study, the collected data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social
           Sciences (SPSS), version 25. To identify factors associated with difficulties to access sanitary pad
                                                                                                                          2
           during COVID19, we first performed bivariate analysis using Pearson’s chi-square test (χ ). All
           factors found significant at P-value<0.05 were incorporated into the bivariate logistic regression
           model. The statistical significance level was set at p < 0.05.
           Results

           Table 1 depicts college students' characteristics. The mean age of students was 20.06 years
           (SD = 1.78). There were more Undergraduate students (87.7%) participants, and the majority
           of students were Hindu (85.5%) followed by Muslims (11.7%). About 55.9% of students
           were General caste, followed by Other Backward Class (33.8%). About 48.8 percent of the
           student fathers were school educated, and 34.3 percent were graduate, followed by
           Postgraduate and higher (16.9%). Though 60.2 % of the student mothers were school
           educated, graduates (28%) and Postgraduate and higher (11.8%). The majority of student
           fathers were self-employed/businessman (27.9%) followed by private organization
           employees (26%), Government employees (20.7%), farmers (10%). Besides, 86.9% of
           student mothers were homemakers. The majority (59.1%) students' monthly family's income
           was less than 25 thousand and lived with a Nuclear family (66.5%). More than three fourth
           students' place of residence was urban Lucknow. Nearly 15.1 % of students reported they had
           previously used reusable cloth.
           Table 2 exhibits the relationship between students' characteristics and difficulties to access
           sanitary pad during COVID19 lockdown. The present study reported nearly 12.5 percent of
           students encountered a problem to access sanitary pad during the lockdown. Caste, religion,
           Father's education, Mother's education, Father's occupation, Mother's occupation, Monthly
           salary, type of family, residence place, and history of reusable cloth uses were statistically
           associated with difficulties to access sanitary pads during COVID19 lockdown.

           Difficulties encountered to access sanitary pad access during the COVID19 lockdown were
           influenced significantly by religion, father's education, father's occupation, monthly salary,
           place of residence, and history of reusable cloth use. Among religion, Muslim students were
           more likely (AOR 2.182 95%CI:1.354-3.517) to encounter difficulties in accessing sanitary
           pads compared to Hindu students. Furthermore, Students whose fathers were graduates were
           less likely (AOR 0.559 95% CI:0.349-0.897) to encounter difficulties accessing sanitary pads
           than those whose fathers were school educated. Students whose father were farmers were
           more likely (AOR 1.998 95% CI:1.013-3.937) face difficulties accessing sanitary pads than
           those whose fathers were government employees. Students whose monthly family income
           was between 25 to 50 thousand were less likely (AOR 0.560 95% CI:0.334-0.937) encounter
           difficulties to access sanitary pads compare to those whose monthly income was less than 25
           thousand. Students' residence location was rural and more likely (AOR 1.736 95%CI: 1.194-
           2.525) meet difficulties accessing sanitary pads compared to their counterparts. Students with
           a history of reusable clothes were more likely to face problems (AOR 2.858 CI:1.942-4.205)
           to access sanitary pads compared to those who have not previously used reusable cloth (Table
           3).
           Discussion

           This is the first study to evaluate difficulties to access sanitary pads during COVID19
           lockdown in any countries. Our study is only focused on college students especially
           Undergraduate and Postgraduate students in Lucknow which is capital of Uttar Pradesh state
           in India. Data also shows that Lucknow is the worst COVID-19 affected district in UP, a
           fifth-worst COVID-19 affected state in India (30). Since the COVID-19 outbreak media
           reported about difficulties for menstruating women in accessing menstrual hygiene products
           (31) in India as well as abroad(32)(33). However, there has been no scientific evidence
           available of the difficulties faced by the menstruating women to access sanitary pads during
           lockdown. This study is also small steps to add a new evidence about the prevalence of
           difficulties as well as predictors to access sanitary pads.
           Present study found 12.5 percent college students faced difficulties to access sanitary pads
           during lockdown. The commonly used alternative for pads during lockdown were homemade
           reusable cloth pad. Similar type of pad were also used in Rwanda, however, women and girls
           also used rags, leaves, newspapers or other makeshift items to absorb or collect menstrual
           blood(34). Most girls in India is not comfortable for asking men in the family to procure pads
           for them since periods is a taboo subject not openly talked about in Indian families. In

           addition, during lockdown when all the men were at home because of the lockdown, girls and
           women may find it difficult to use toilet facilities as frequently and getting additional water to
           wash pads and put them out in the sun to dry (10). Students managed menstruation during
           lockdown by using the pad of brand which they never used earlier and size, or by paid more
           price, bought from another place, used old cloth, home-made pad, and sponge.
           Present study revealed that Muslims students faced difficulties to access sanitary pads during
           COVID19 lockdown. Reason may be Muslims in India displayed lowest work participation
           rate(35). Further, Muslims mostly rely on the informal economy (36) and during COVID19
           lockdown informal workers suffer more (37) in India as well as abroad(38). It may be the
           reason because of low family income and poor income during lockdown, Muslim girls may
           compromise with their menstrual needs and personal hygiene.
           Students whose fathers were graduates were less likely to encounter difficulties accessing
           sanitary pads than those whose fathers were school educated. In previous study in Nepal also
           reported association of good menstrual hygiene practice with father’s education(39).Educated
           father were have more awareness and concerned about the hygiene of their daughter.
           Students whose father were farmers as well rural residence students were more likely face
           difficulties accessing sanitary pads compared to those whose father were government
           employees. In previous studies in India(20) and Ghana(40) where adolescents whose fathers
           were farmers had poor menstrual hygiene management were found. During COVID-19
           lockdown time Indian farmers faced new challenges in front of agriculture sector that is
           already under threat. The lockdown created both a shortage of labour, equipment, access to

           seeds, fertilizers and pesticides (41).This all make farmers highly vulnerable to the present
           crisis. Reason In rural areas, women do not have access to sanitary products so uses of
           sanitary napkins is very low. Another reasons were high cost of branded napkins, and cultural
           barriers (42). So, they mostly rely on reusable cloth pads which they wash and use again(43).
           However, college students purchase it when they come to college. But due to lockdown they
           are not able to come outside.
           Students whose monthly family income was between 25 to 50 thousand were less likely to
           encounter difficulties accessing sanitary pads than those whose monthly income was less than
           25 thousand. Due to limited household income during the lockdown, people prioritized other
           household demands and did not prefer to spend their fixed income purchasing sanitary pads.
           On the other hand, prosperous people buy the product in mass. In India society is patriarchal
           and during lockdown women are not able to told their family member for sanitary napkin.

           Men do not support women regarding menstruation hygiene and do not give money to buy
           menstrual products. So women have to rely on cheap reusable cloth pads which they have to
           wash, dry, and use again.
           Study also found students with a history of reusable clothes were more likely to face
           problems to access sanitary pads compared to those who have not previously used reusable
           cloth. They may more chance that students those unable to afford such products due to high
           cost previously may also not afford it during lockdown any may be from lower income or
           rural areas. So, they mostly rely on reusable cloth pads which they wash and use again(43).
           Strength and limitations of the study

           The study tried to evaluate the difficulties to access sanitary pads during lockdown by online
           survey and tried to cover all types of students. However, this study has a limitation. First, the
           study design's cross-sectional nature might not show the cause and effect relationships
           between study variables. Second, this study follows only quantitative data collection, and
           mixed approaches do not triangulate it. Third, the study lacks random sampling, which leads
           the statistical confidence and margin of error.
           Conclusion

           About 12.5 college students faced difficulties with accessing sanitary pads during the
           lockdown. Muslims, Father education illiterate or upto12th, Father occupation as farmer,
           Monthly salary less than 25 thousand, place of residence as rural, and history of uses of
           reusable clothes were more likely to face problems to access sanitary pads were significant
           correlates of difficulties to access sanitary pads during the lockdown in Lucknow. It
           demonstrates a need to design acceptable advocacy programs for menstruating females
           during a crisis because menstruation does not cease during any emergency.
