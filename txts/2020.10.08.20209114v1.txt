32     Abstract
33     Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been reported in several virus infections
34     including dengue fever virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle
35     East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection. To study whether ADE is
36     involved in COVID-19 infections, in vitro pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 entry into Raji
37     cells, K562 cells, and primary B cells mediated by plasma from recovered COVID-19
38     patients were employed as models. The enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells
39     was more commonly detected in plasma from severely-affected elderly patients with
40     high titers of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibodies. Cellular entry was
41     mediated via the engagement of FcγRII receptor through virus-cell membrane fusion,
42     but not by endocytosis. Peptide array scanning analyses showed that antibodies which
43     promote SARS-CoV-2 infection targeted the variable regions of the RBD domain. To
44     further characterize the association between the spike-specific antibody and ADE, an
45     RBD-specific monoclonal antibody (7F3) was isolated from a recovered patient, which
46     potently inhibited SARS-Cov-2 infection of ACE-2 expressing cells and also mediated
47     ADE in Raji cells. Site-directed mutagenesis the spike RBD domain reduced the
48     neutralization activity of 7F3, but did not abolish its binding to the RBD domain.
49     Structural analysis using cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) revealed that 7F3 binds
50     to spike proteins at a shift-angled pattern with one “up” and two “down” RBDs,
51     resulting in partial overlapping with the receptor binding motif (RBM), while a
52     neutralizing monoclonal antibody that lacked ADE activity binds to spike proteins with
53     three “up” RBDs, resulting in complete overlapping with RBM. Our results revealed
54     that ADE mediated by SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies could result from
55     binding to the receptor in slightly different pattern from antibodies mediating
56     neutralizations. Studies on ADE using antibodies from recovered patients via cell
57     biology and structural biology technology could be of use for developing novel
58     therapeutic and preventive measures for control of COVID-19 infection.

60     Introduction
61     The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute
62     respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had resulted in a total of 34.8
63     million cases of infection and over 1 million deaths worldwide by October 4, 2020,1.
64     No therapeutic drugs against SARS-CoV-2 are currently available, and the development
65     of vaccines is considered as the most effective approach to control the ongoing
66     pandemic. Multiple platforms are being developed as a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,
67     including DNA- and RNA-based formulations, recombinant viral subunits, replicating
68     viral vectors and purified inactivated viral particles, are under development, and several
69     vaccine candidates are presently being evaluated for efficacy in phase III trials2.
70     Most vaccines incorporate SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein or its receptor-binding
71     domain (RBD) as immunogens. As the primary targets for neutralizing antibodies
72     (NAbs), the S protein and RBD are promising immunogens to induce protective NAbs
73     in vaccine recipients3-6. However, preclinical experience with severe acute respiratory
74     syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) vaccine candidates
75     has raised safety concerns about the potential for antibody-dependent enhancement
76     (ADE) induced by coronavirus S protein7-11. ADE is an enhancement of viral entry into
77     immune cells mediated by antibody via the engagement of the Fc receptors12,13. This
78     phenomenon has been documented with mosquito-borne flavivirus infections, such as
79     dengue14 and Zika viruses15. For dengue virus, the ADE of virus infection of immune
80     cells resulted in the enhancement of disease severity especially at the second infections
81     with different virus strains in humans16. For coronaviruses, ADE has been mainly
82     reported in animal models infected by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and feline coronavirus,
83     in which exacerbated lung disease was observed when vaccinated animals were infected
84     with viruses7,10,17. In both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, ADE was mediated
85     with antibodies against spike (S) proteins7,9. Although S protein-specific antibodies
86     were elicited in most patients with COVID-19, the antibody titers were higher in elderly
87     patients of COVID-19, and stronger antibody response was associated with delayed
88     viral clearance and increased disease severity in patients18,19. Hence it is reasonable to

 89     speculate that S protein-specific antibodies may contribute to disease severity during
 90     SARS-CoV-2 infection11,20,21. Furthermore, the potential for such ADE responses is of
 91     concern for SARS-CoV-2 in the use of convalescent plasma or antibodies as a treatment
                                            22,23
 92     in COVID-19 patients                      . However, whether SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies or
 93     convalescent plasma could promote virus infection of immune cells or enhance disease
 94     severity has not been documented.
 95     Here, we used an in vitro pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection assay to evaluate the
 96     ability of plasma and antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients to promote SARS-
 97     CoV-2 infection of immune cells, and analyzed the associated clinical and
 98     immunological characteristics.

100     Results
101     Clinical Characteristics
102     This study enrolled 222 patients in total who had recovered from COVID-19 and were
103     discharged from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center as of April 23, 2020. Of
104     the 222 patients, 205 had mild symptoms and 17 had severe symptoms. The median
105     [interquartile range, IQR] age of patients was 53 [38-65] years; 49 % of the patients
106     were female. The median length of hospital stay was 17 [13-24] days, and the median
107     disease duration was 23 [18-30] days.
108
109     Plasma from recovered patients of COVID-19 showed enhancement of SARS-
110     CoV-2 infection of immune cells
111     We collected plasma samples from 205 patients who had recovered from mild COVID-
112     19 at the time of discharge (median days 22), as well as 17 patients who had recovered
113     from severe COVID-19 at the time before discharge (median days 34), and evaluated
114     the enhancement of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro for each patient
115     plasma by using Raji cells that are lymphoma cells derived from human B lymphocytes.
116     The cells expressed human FcγRII (CD32) and were used for ADE assay of SARS-CoV

117     previously24. Plasma from 16 (8%) of the recovered patients with mild COVID-19 and
118     13 (76%) of the recovered patients with severe COVID-19 (N=17, median age 66)
119     showed a concentration-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection of Raji cells,
120     indicated by the increase of luciferase expression in Raji cells (Figure S1,1A). The
121     enhancement of virus infection was significantly higher in plasma from COVID-19
122     patients compared with plasma from uninfected controls (P < 0.0001, Figure 1B, S1).
123     Moreover, plasma from these 29 patients also showed detectable enhanced infection of
124     Raji cells of pseudotyped bat-origin SARS-like coronavirus, either RS3367 or WIV1
125     (P = 0.0108 or P = 0.0046, Figure 1B), while none of the plasma showed enhancement
126     of SARS-CoV infection (Figure 1B).
127     The enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection by patient plasma was also observed when
128     K562 cells derived from human monocytes were used as targets (P = 0.0006, Figure S2,
129     1C). Furthermore, the enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection was also confirmed
130     when cultured primary B cells were used as targets. As shown in Figure S3, eight
131     representative positive plasma samples, four from patients with mild COVID-19 and
132     the other four from patients with severe COVID-19, showed concentration-dependent
133     enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary B cells. These eight plasma
134     mediated significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 infection than control plasma from
135     uninfected donors (P = 0.004, Figure 1D).
136     In the following studies, Raji cells were used as targets on the mechanism of
137     enhancement of SARS-CoV2 infection because they were easily maintained and
138     generated higher luciferase reading than K562 cells and primary B cells.
139
140     Enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mediated by IgG antibodies
141     engagement of FcγRII receptor
142     To confirm whether the enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mediated by
143     antibodies, we purified IgG from the plasma and measured the enhancement of SARS-
144     CoV-2 infection of Raji cells by purified antibodies and IgG-depleted plasma,
        5

145     respectively. As shown in Figure 1E, purified IgG showed enhancement of SARS-CoV-
146     2 infection, which was similar to plasma from patients. The depletion of IgG from
147     plasma completely abolished the infection of Raji cells, confirming that the
148     enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mediated by IgG in plasma. We further
149     used anti-CD32 antibody to block the cell surface FcɤRII receptor to evaluate the
150     engagement of FcɤRII receptor in promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection. The addition of
151     anti-CD32 antibody eliminated the enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection by both
152     plasma (Figure 1F) and purified IgG (Figure 1G) from patients. These results indicated
153     that the in vitro enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection by patient plasma was mediated
154     by IgG antibodies with the engagement of FcɤRII receptor, which is similar to the ADE
155     of virus infections including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Zika, and dengue viruses.
156
157     ADE is more likely to develop in elderly patients with severe and critical condition,
158     longer hospital stays and disease duration
159     We investigated the clinical characteristics of 29 recovered patients whose plasma
160     showed ADE effect. The median age of these patients (65 [58-72] years) was
161     significantly higher than the patients without ADE effect (50 [37-64] years, P < 0.0001,
162     Figure 1H). The median disease duration time and the length of hospital stays of
163     patients whose plasma showed ADE was significantly longer than patients without
164     ADE effect (35 [23-60] days vs. 22 [18-29] days, P < 0.0001, and 30 [19-55] days vs.
165     17 [13-23] days, P < 0.0001, Figure 1I and 1J). These results indicated that ADE is more
166     likely to develop in elderly patients with severe and critical condition, longer hospital
167     stays and disease duration, suggesting a possible association of ADE with disease
168     severity in COVID-19 patients.
169     To evaluate whether the ADE effect resulted from pre-exposure to other pathogens in
170     elderly patients, we collected plasma from 18 uninfected elderly donors aged 60 to 80
171     years and tested them for ADE. None of the plasma from uninfected control donors
172     showed an ADE effect (P = 0.3085, Figure S4), confirming that ADE appeared to be

173     the result of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
174
175     ADE is more likely to develop in patients with high titers of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-
176     and S1-specific antibodies
177     Next, we evaluated the relationship between ADE effect and SARS-CoV-2-specific
178     antibodies. Significantly higher titers of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs (P < 0.0001, Figure 2A),
179     as well as RBD-specific (P < 0.0001) and S1-specific binding antibodies (P < 0.0001)
180     (Figure 2B), were found in plasma with ADE effect compared to plasma without ADE
181     effect, while S2-specific antibodies showed no difference. Then we evaluated the
182     kinetics of ADE effect, binding antibodies, and NAbs during the course of disease in
183     six patients for whom sequential plasma samples were available. The kinetics of ADE
184     development was similar among all patients, starting to increase at day 10 post-disease
185     onset, reaching their peak at day 20, and remaining stable for at least 40-81 days (Figure
186     2C and Figure S5A). The kinetics of titers of antibodies binding to RBD and S1 (Figure
187     2D and Figure S5B) was similar to the kinetics of ADE (Figure 2C and Figure S5B red
188     line), while the kinetics of NAbs in these patients was different. The titers of NAbs in
189     the six patients increased on day 10 post-disease onset and reached a very high level
190     around day 20 (median ID50 = 2877) (Figure 2E and Figure S3C blue line). However,
191     NAb titers dramatically dropped to low levels (median ID50 = 545) after day 30 post-
192     disease onset. These results indicated that high levels of binding antibodies might
193     contribute to the ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
194
195     ADE was mediated by antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD subunits
196     To further determine the role of spike-specific antibodies in mediating ADE of SARS-
197     CoV-2 infection, we incubated SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 proteins with plasma to block
198     the protein-specific antibodies before measuring the ADE effect of plasma samples.
199     Pre-incubation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein at a concentration as low as 0.1 μg/ml
200     could completely block the ADE effect of plasma from the representative patient 8
        7

201     (Figure 3A), and pre-incubation with S1 protein at the concentration of 1 μg/ml could
202     also block the ADE effect (Figure 3B). However, pre-incubation with SARS-CoV RBD
203     or S1 protein did not change the ADE activity in plasma (Figure 3C and 3D). The
204     inhibition of ADE effect by SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein was also observed in the plasma
205     from other patients. As shown in Figure 3E, pre-incubation of 10 μg/ml SARS-CoV-2
206     RBD significantly reduced ADE effect mediated by plasma from six tested patients (P
207     = 0.009). These results indicated that the ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mediated
208     by antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD subunits.
209
210     ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred through the virus-cell membrane fusion
211     It was suggested that the ADE of viral infection was mediated by phagocytosis of
212     immune complexes via FcγRII / CD32 receptor25. However, the addition of chloroquine,
213     a phagocytosis inhibitor which could raise the pH of phagolysosomes and inhibit the
214     phagocytosis of mononuclear cells26, did not inhibit the ADE by the plasma, even at the
215     highest concentration of 50 μM (Figure 4A). In contrast, EK1 peptide, which has been
216     demonstrated to inhibit virus-cell membranes fusion by binding to the HR1 domain and
217     thus inhibiting the formation of the six-helix bundle (6HB) of SARS-CoV-2 S2
218     protein27, blocked ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
219     4B). The inhibition of ADE effect by EK1 peptide, but not chloroquine, was observed
220     for six tested plasma samples with ADE effect (P = 0.0064, Figure 4C). These results
221     indicated that ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mediated through virus-to-cell
222     membrane fusion, not phagocytosis.
223     The ability of plasma to promote virus-to-cell membrane fusion was confirmed by an
224     in vitro syncytium formation assay, using HEK-293T cells expressing the SARS-CoV-
225     2 S protein as effector cells and Raji cells as target cells. No syncytium formation
226     occurred in the presence of control plasma (Figure 4D, left). However, large syncytium
227     was induced by plasma from representative patients 5, 7, and 8 in a dose-dependent

229     from COVID-19 patients was specifically inhibited by the addition of EK1 peptide, but
230     not chloroquine (Figure 4D, right; Figure 4E). These results again confirmed that ADE
231     of SARS-CoV-2 infection by plasma was mainly through cell-to-cell membrane fusion,
232     a pathway involved in the formation of the six-helix bundle (6HB) of SARS-CoV-2 S2
233     protein, which could be inhibited by EK1 peptide.
234
235     RBD-specific human NAb 7F3 with ADE effect enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection
236     and promoted virus entry into Raji cells through the virus-cell membrane fusion
237     We further evaluated the characterization of antibodies with ADE effect by isolating
238     two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from recovered COVID-19 patient. These two
239     mAbs, termed as 7F3 and 4L12, were isolated by in vitro single B cell culture and
240     subsequent high-throughput micro-neutralization screening assay from the same
241     recovered COVID-19 patient. Both of the antibodies potently neutralized SARS-CoV-
242     2 pesudovirus infection of 293T cells expressing ACE2 protein with an IC50 of 0.00684
243     μg/ml and 0.00452 μg/ml, respectively (Figure 5A). The two antibodies bound to
244     SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 proteins, but not S2, in the ELISA assay (Figure 5B).
245     Antibody 7F3 had higher binding affinity to RBD protein with a KD value of 0.69±
246     0.03 nM, when compared to antibody 4L12 which bound to RBD with a KD value of
247     1.49 ± 0.06 nM (Figure 5C). Antibody 7F3 showed a concentration-dependent
248     enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection of Raji cells (Figure 5D), while antibody 4L12
249     did not. The enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection by antibody 7F3 was also
250     dependent on the interaction between antibody Fc region with FcɤRII receptor, because
251     the enhancement could be completely abolished by either removal of antibody Fc
252     region (Figure 5E) or blocking FcɤRII receptor with anti-CD32 antibody (Figure 5F).
253     We also compared the ADE effect of different isotypes of 7F3 antibodies which were
254     generated by linking different heavy-chain constant regions to the same variable region
255     of 7F3 antibody. The IgG1 isotype showed the strongest ADE effect, IgG4 isotype
256     showed detectable ADE effect, while IgG2 and IgG3 did not show any detectable ADE

257     (Figure 5G), possibly resulting from the different binding affinity to FcɤRII receptor on
258     Raji cells. Consistent with the observations for plasma samples from recovered patients,
259     antibody 7F3-mediated enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be specifically
260     reduced by pre-incubation with RBD protein of SARS-CoV-2, but not from SARS-CoV
261     virus (Figure 5H), and the ADE could also be blocked by fusion-inhibitor EK1 peptide,
262     but not chloroquine (Figure 5I), suggesting that antibody 7F3-mediated ADE of SARS-
263     CoV-2 infection of Raji cells also occurred through virus-to-cell membrane fusion.
264
265     Peptide scanning for hot spots in RBD associated with ADE effect
266     Next, we explored the epitopes in RBD to which patient plasma and NAb 7F3 bound
267     and induced ADE. We synthesized a series of 20-mer peptides with 10 amino acid
268     overlap spanning the RBD region (304-593) to block the ADE of patient plasma and
269     antibody 7F3. Peptides from the S1 region, i.e., 304-323, 364-383, 544-563, 564-583,
270     and 574-593, dramatically blocked the ADE of both patient plasma (Figure 6A) and
271     7F3 (Figure 6B) and decreased >70 % of AUC (Figure 6C). Peptides from S1 regions
272     454-473 and 484-503 decreased 50-62% of the AUC for both ADE patient plasma and
273     7F3. Peptides from S1 regions 484-403 and 525-543 specifically blocked ADE patient
274     plasma, but not 7F3. These results suggested that several epitopes in RBD were
275     associated with ADE by antibodies.
276
277     ADE antibody 7F3 and non-ADE antibody 4L12 shared overlapping epitopes but
278     showed different binding abilities to RBD
279     To more precisely map the epitopes on RBD recognized by antibody 7F3, we
280     introduced single amino acid substitutions into the spike RBD domain and constructed
281     25 spike mutants, including seven mutants that were reported to be resistant to NAbs28,
282     as well as a prevalent mutant D614G29 (Figure 7, highlighted in blue), and evaluated
283     their sensitivity to neutralization of antibody 7F3. As shown in Figure 7A, 7F3
284     neutralized all seven mutants that resistant to NAbs and the prevalent mutant D614D.
285     Three amino acid substitutions, including F342L, P491A, and E516A exhibited

286     complete resistance to the neutralization of both 7F3 and 4L12 (IC50 >50 μg/ml),
287     suggesting overlapping between the epitopes of 7F3 and 4L12.
288     We expressed the RBD protein mutants and measured the binding ability of 7F3 to these
289     mutants relative to wild type RBD. None of these mutations except P491A affected 7F3
290     and 4L12 binding to spike protein (Figure 7B and 7C). A mutant with single mutation
291     D427A and four mutants with three amino acid alanine substitutions in RBD showed
292     decreased binding to 4L12 but had no effect on 7F3 binding (Figure 7B and 7C). Even
293     though mutations F342L and E516A in the RBD region affected 7F3 neutralization,
294     they did not impact 7F3 binding, which may play an important role in ADE.
295
296     Structures of 7F3 or 4L12 in complex with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 revealed
297     different binding patterns
298     To characterize the molecular details of the antibodies mediating ADE, we solved the
299     cryo-EM structures of S-ECD bound with 7F3 or 4L12 at an overall resolution of 3.3
300     Å and 3.0 Å, respectively (Figure S6-S8, Table S1). Details of cryo-EM sample
301     preparation, data collection and processing, as well as model building, can be found in
302     the Materials and Methods section in Supplementary Information (SI).
303     The overall resolution for S-ECD was good enough for model building, whereas the
304     resolution at the interface between 7F3 and S-ECD was worse owing to the flexibility.
305     We only docked the light chain and heavy chain of 7F3 into the cryo EM map. The S
306     protein bound with 7F3 exhibits a conformation with one “up” and two “down” RBDs,
307     among which the “up” RBD and one of two “down” RBDs were bound by 7F3, whereas
308     the other “down” RBD was not bound by 7F3 (Figure 8A). In contrast to the S/7F3
309     complex, all three RBDs of S protein were in “up” conformation and bound with 4L12
310     in the S/4L12 complex (Figure 8B). Additionally, the interfaces between antibodies and
311     RBD in both antibodies are overlapped with binding to ACE2 (Figure S9).
312     The resolution at the interface between 4L12 and RBD was improved to 3.5 Å by
313     focused refinement, allowing detailed analysis (Fig. S7). When compared with 4L12

314     bound structure, 7F3 bound to RBD with a shift of about 28.5 angstroms (Figure 8C),
315     making a different binding pattern. In summary, structural analysis indicates that both
316     7F3 and 4L12 can block the binding between ACE2 and RBD. The binding interface of
317     7F3 is accessible on the “down” RBD and is partially overlapped with the edge of the
318     receptor binding motif (RBM) (Figure 8D), which is consistent with the competing
319     results of peptides 454-473 and 484-503 (Figure 6C) and the amino acid P491A
320     substitution result (Figure 7A, B). Additionally, the epitope residues of 4L12 are
321     distributed across RBM, fully competing with ACE2 (Figure 8D). These results suggest
322     that the different ability of antibody 7F3 and 4L12 to induce ADE may result from the
323     different binding patterns to spike proteins.
324
325     Discussion
326     The role of antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infection has remained unclear. For most
327     infectious viral diseases, the concentrations of virus-specific antibodies correlate with
328     viral clearance and protection, while it is different in patients of COVID-19. It was
329     reported that stronger antibody response was associated with delayed viral clearance
330     and increased disease severity in patients of COVID-1930. We also reported that NAb
331     titers were higher in elderly patients of COVID-19, who tend to have worse outcomes,
332     while a few patients recovered without generating detectable NAbs18. Here we reported
333     the observation of in vitro ADE of SARS-CoV-2 entry into FcɤRII receptor-bearing
334     cells by plasma and antibodies from patients who recovered from COVID-19. The
335     antibody enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 entry may enhance viral replication in immune
336     cells, since it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 could productively infect immune
337     cells including monocytes and B cells both in vivo and ex vivo31. Because of the limited
338     availability of tissue samples from these patients, we could not directly evaluate the
339     immuno-pathological damage associated with ADE. However, in our study the
340     enhancement of virus infection was more commonly observed in plasma from older
341     patients with severe symptoms, and it was associated with prolonged disease duration,
        12

342     suggesting that ADE may be associated with worse clinical outcomes during SARS-
343     CoV-2 infection.
344     Previous studies on SARS-CoV have shown that antibodies mediating ADE of SARS-
345     CoV infection were mainly targeting an immunodominant linear epitope (S597–603)
346     located at C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV spike protein32. Here we found that
347     antibodies mediating enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection were mainly targeting the
348     RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The enhancement could be completely
349     blocked by pre-adsorption of RBD-specific antibodies in plasma with RBD protein. As
350     the receptor binding site of the spike protein, the RBD domain is the main target for
351     neutralizing antibodies33. Our results indicated that some RBD-specific antibodies, for
352     example antibody 7F3 in this study, have dual effects in mediating both neutralization
353     and ADE. The effect of neutralization or ADE was dependent on receptor expression
354     on the target cells and concentration of the antibody. When viruses infect cells
355     expressing ACE2, such as Huh-7 cells or lung alveolar epithelial cells, antibody 7F3 at
356     optimal neutralizing concentration could block RBD binding to ACE2 and inhibit viral
357     infection. However, when viruses infect cells expressing Fc receptors, such as Raji,
358     K562, or primary immune cells, the antibody at suboptimal neutralizing concentration
359     promotes virus entry into cells through interaction between antibody and Fc receptors
360     (Figure 9). We found that amino acid substitutions F342L and E516A on RBD allowed
361     the virus escape from the neutralization by 7F3 without reducing binding affinity to
362     antibody. How these mutants abolished the antibody neutralization without affecting
363     binding affinity requires further studies.
364     It is interesting that antibody-mediated viral entry into Fc receptor-bearing cells was
365     not through phagocytosis, but rather, through virus-to-cell membrane fusion. However,
366     the molecular mechanism that regulates the interaction among spike protein, antibody
367     and Fc receptors in order to initiate virus-cell membrane fusion remains unknown. It
368     should be noted that not all RBD-specific antibodies will induce ADE effect. Antibodies
369     that can induce ADE in this study bind to the spike with one “up” and two “down” RBD
370     domains, while the antibodies that cannot induce ADE bind to the spike with three “up”

371     RBD domains. Therefore, the different binding pattern to spike proteins may result in
372     different abilities to promote ADE, but the detailed mechanism requires further studies.
373     Our results revealed that antibodies mediating ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection were not
374     the result of pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies from other coronavirus infection34,
375     but were generated de novo following infection with SARS-CoV-2. First, the plasma
376     from COVID-19 patients did not significantly promote the enhancement of SARS-CoV
377     coronavirus infection. Second, pre-incubation with SARS-CoV RBD did not block the
378     enhancement of virus infection by either plasma or monoclonal antibody 7F3. Third,
379     mAb 7F3, which promotes the enhancement of virus infection, specifically binds to
380     RBD of SARS-COV-2 virus, but no other coronaviruses. These results also suggest that
381     ADE may be more likely to occur at later time points after recovery from COVID-19
382     when the concentration of neutralizing antibodies elicited by the primary SARS-CoV-
383     2 infection have waned to suboptimal neutralizing level.
384
385     Limitations
386     In this study, plasma and antibodies was measured by an in vitro cell-based pseudovirus
387     assay to evaluate the enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection of immune cells. Whether
388     such enhancement of virus infection results in disease severity needs to be validated in
389     appropriate animal models.
390
391     Implication for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine research and therapies
392     Although several SARS-Cov-2 vaccines have been undergoing phase III clinical trials,
393     the potential ADE of coronavirus infection still remains a safety concern for any vaccine
394     candidates. The observation of enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection mediated by
395     plasma and antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients in this study does not
396     indicate that vaccine candidates would necessarily induce ADE or disease severity.
397     However, these results suggest that vaccine candidates should be evaluated for
        14

398     induction of ADE in addition to induction of neutralizing antibodies. A vaccine that can
399     induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies should be safer than one inducing low titers
400     since 1) most the newly invaded virions are neutralized before the ADE occurs and 2)
401     neutralizing antibodies mediate ADE only at the suboptimal neutralizing concentration.
402     Furthermore, these results also suggested that plasma and antibodies from patients who
403     recovered from COVID-19 should be tested for potential ADE effect before clinical
404     usage.

406     Methods
407     Study design and participants

454     cultured at 37 °C for 48 hours. For primary B cells ADE assay, 100 μl of cultured B
455     cells were seeded into wells at a concentration of 1 X 104 cells per well in the presence
456     of irritated 3T3-msCD40L feeder cells, IL-2, and IL-21 and cultured at 37 °C for 48
457     hours. Ten μl of heat-inactivated plasma were two-fold serially diluted with DMEM
458     with 10% FBS and mixed with 40 μl pseudovirus at 37 °C for 30 minutes. For ADE
459     inhibition assay, different concentrations of RBD or S1 protein from SARS-CoV-2,
460     RBD or S1 protein from SARS-CoV, 20-mer peptides spanning RBD region (20 μg/ml),
461     EK1 peptide (50 μM), or chloroquine (50 μM), or mouse anti-human CD32 monoclonal
462     antibody (5 μg/ml) were incubated with serially diluted patient plasma at 37 °C for 1
463     hour before mixing with pseudovirus. The mixture was added into cultured cells for
464     infection. After 12 hours, 150 μl of culture medium were added to the cells and
465     incubated for an additional 48 hours. The infection of cells was evaluated by luciferase
466     expression, as determined with a luciferase assay system (Promega) and read on a
467     luminometer (Perkin Elmer). The enhancement of virus infection was expressed as the
468     fold changes of luciferase reading comparing to virus control without addition of
469     plasma or antibodies.

471     Purification of IgG from human plasma
472     Heat-inactivated human plasma samples were 1:6 diluted in PBS and filtered through
473     0.22 µm filters. The diluted plasma was incubated with protein G beads (Smart-
474     Lifesciences) at 4 °C overnight. The mixture was loaded on filtration column, and IgG-
475     depleted plasma was collected from the flow through. After washing with 150 ml PBS,
476     the beads binding IgG were eluted with 8 ml of 0.1M glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.7) and
477     neutralized with 200 µl of 2 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The eluted IgG was
478     concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugation units (50 kDa, Millipore) after triple
479     washing with 15 ml PBS. Purified IgG was diluted with PBS to the same volume as
480     that of the original plasma samples before evaluation.

482     Neutralization assay
483     Neutralization activity of plasma and antibodies was measured by the inhibition of
484     pseudovirus infection with 293 T/ACE2 cells as previously described18. Briefly,
485     293 T/ACE2 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a concentration of 104 cells per well
486     and cultured for 12 hours. Then, ten μl heat-inactivated plasma were five-fold serially
487     diluted with DMEM with 10% FBS and mixed with 40 μl of pseudovirus. The mixture
488     was added to cultured 293 T/ACE2 cells for infection. The culture medium was
489     refreshed after 12 hours and incubated for an additional 48 hours. Assays were
490     developed with a luciferase assay system (Promega), and the relative light units (RLU)
491     were read on a luminometer (Perkin Elmer). The titers of NAbs were calculated as 50%
492     inhibitory dose (ID50), expressed as the highest dilution of plasma which resulted in a
493     50% reduction of luciferase luminescence compared with virus control.

495     Cell-cell fusion assay mediated by ADE patient plasma.
496     Cell-cell fusion assay was conducted as previously described with modification27.
497     Briefly, HEK-293T cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein on the cell membrane
498     were used as effector cells, while Raji cells were used as target cells. HEK293T cells
499     were transfected with plasmid pAAV-IRES-EGFP-SARS-2-S, using transfection
500     reagent VigoFect (Vigorous Biotechnology, China). Raji cells were seeded at a density
501     of 5 x 104 cells per well into the 96-well plates which were precoated with 100 μl of 0.1
502     mg/ml of Poly L-lysine for 30 min at 37°C. The effector cells were collected 24 hours
503     after transfection and mixed with the serially diluted serum at 37°C for 30 min. The
504     mixture of effector cells and serum was applied onto the Raji cells and cultured for an
505     additional 24 hours. After fixing with 4 % paraformaldehyde, the cells were observed
506     and captured using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti-S). The
507     fused cells were counted on five random fields in each well. For inhibition assay, EK1
508     peptide or chloroquine (TargetMol) was two-fold serially diluted in RPMI 1640 and

512     ELISA
513     SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S1, or S2 protein were coated on a MaxiSorp Nunc-immuno 96-
514     well plate (Thermo Scientific, USA) overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked with 5%
515     nonfat milk (Biofroxx, Germany) in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by
516     incubation with 1:400 diluted sera or serially diluted sera in disruption buffer (PBS, 5%
517     FBS, 2% BSA, and 1% Tween-20) for 1 hour at room temperature. A 1:2500 dilution
518     of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody (Jackson
519     Immuno Research Laboratories, USA) was added for 1 hour at room temperature. Wells
520     were developed using ABST (Thermo Scientific, USA) for 30 minutes and read at 405
521     nm on a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific, USA).
522
523     Memory B-cell staining, sorting and antibody cloning
524     SARS-CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies were isolated from mononuclear cells
525     (PBMC) of recovered patients by in vitro single B cell as previously described35. Briefly,
526     CD19+IgA−IgD−IgM− memory B cells were sorted and resuspended in medium with
527     IL-2, IL-21, and irradiated 3T3-msCD40L feeder cells, followed by seeding into 384-
528     well plates at a density of 4 cells per well. After 13 days of incubation, supernatants
529     from each well were screened for neutralization activity using a high-throughput micro-
530     neutralization assay against SARS-CoV-2. From the wells that scored positive in the
531     neutralization assay, the variable region of the heavy chain and the light chain of the
532     immunoglobulin gene was amplified by RT–PCR and re-expressed as described
533     previously36,37. The full-length IgG was purified using a protein G column (Smart-
534     Lifesciences).

537     The kinetics of monoclonal antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein was
538     measured by biolayer interferometry binding assay on a FortéBio OctetRED96
539     instrument using anti-human IgG (AHC) biosensors as previously described38 The
540     assay followed sequential steps at 30℃ as follows. First, the biosensor was immersed
541     in sterile water for 60s, and 10 μg/ml of antibody was loaded on the biosensors. The
542     biosensors were dipped into 0.02% PBST (PBS with 0.02% Tween) for 300 s to reach
543     baseline and then incubated with serially diluted RBD protein solutions for association
544     and PBST for dissociation. Results were analyzed, and Kon, Koff and KD were calculated
545     by FortéBio Data Analysis software (Version 8.1) using 1:1 binding and a global fitting
546     model.
547
548     Cryo-EM sample preparation
549     The peak fractions of complex were concentrated to about 1.5 mg/mL and applied to
550     the grids. Aliquots (3.3 μL) of the protein complex were placed on glow-discharged
551     holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Au R1.2/1.3). The grids were blotted for 2.5 s or 3.0 s
552     and flash-frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen with Vitrobot (Mark IV,
553     Thermo Scientific). The cryo-EM samples were transferred to a Titan Krios operating
554     at 300 kV equipped with Cs corrector, Gatan K3 Summit detector and GIF Quantum
555     energy filter. Movie stacks were automatically collected using AutoEMation 39, with a
556     slit width of 20 eV on the energy filter and a defocus range from -1.2 µm to -2.2 µm in
557     super-resolution mode at a nominal magnification of 81,000×. Each stack was exposed
558     for 2.56 s with an exposure time of 0.08 s per frame, resulting in a total of 32 frames
559     per stack. The total dose rate was approximately 50 e-/Å2 for each stack. The stacks
560     were motion corrected with MotionCor2 40 and binned 2-fold, resulting in a pixel size
                                                                                                 41
561     of 1.087 Å/pixel. Meanwhile, dose weighting was performed                                   . The defocus values
562     were estimated with Gctf 42.

564     Data processing
565     Particles for all samples were automatically picked using Relion 3.0.643-46 from

566     manually selected micrographs. After 2D classification with Relion, good particles
567     were selected and subjected to two cycles of heterogeneous refinement without
568     symmetry using cryoSPARC 47.The good particles were selected and subjected to Non-
569     uniform Refinement (beta) with C1 symmetry, resulting in 3D reconstruction for the
570     whole structures, which were further subjected to 3D auto-refinement and post-
571     processing with Relion. For interface between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and mAb, the
572     dataset was subjected to focused refinement with adapted mask on each RBD-mAb sub-
573     complex to improve map quality. Then the datasets of three similar RBD-mAb sub-
574     complexes were combined and subjected to focused refinement with Relion. The
575     combined dataset was recentered on the interface between RBD and mAb and re-
576     extracted. The re-extracted dataset was 3D classified with Relion focused on RBD-mAb
577     sub-complex. Then the good particles were selected and subjected to focused
578     refinement with Relion, resulting in 3D reconstruction of better quality on the RBD-
579     mAb sub-complex.
580     The resolution was estimated with the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation 0.143
                     48                                                           49
581     criterion         with high-resolution noise substitution                    . Refer to Supplemental Figures
582     S6-S7 and Supplemental Table S1 for details of data collection and processing.
583
584     Model building and structure refinement
585     For model building of all complexes of S-ECD of SARS-CoV-2 with mAb, atomic
586     models (PDB ID: 7C2L) were used as templates, which were molecular dynamics
587     flexible fitted 50 into the whole cryo-EM map of the complex and the focused-refined
588     cryo-EM map of the RBD-mAb sub-complex, respectively. The fitted atomic models
589     were further manually adjusted with Coot 51. Each residue was manually checked with
590     the chemical properties taken into consideration during model building. Several
591     segments were not modeled because the corresponding densities were invisible.
592     Structural refinement was performed in Phenix52 with secondary structure and
593     geometry restraints to prevent overfitting. To monitor the potential overfitting, the
594     model was refined against one of the two independent half maps from the gold standard
        21

793     (A) Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 recovered patients whose plasma showed ADE. (B) The
794     enhancement of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, SARS-related RS3367, WIV-1 infection of Raji cells by 29
795     plasma samples from patients who recovered from mild COVID-19 (N=16, blue) or severe COVID-19
796     (N=13, red) are shown. Plasma from 10 uninfected donors was used as negative controls. For each plasma
797     sample, the area under curve (AUC) of fold changes of enhancement was calculated. (C) The
798     enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection of K562 cells by 29 plasma samples are shown. (D) The
799     enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary B cells by eight representative plasma samples are
800     shown. (E) ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mediated by plasma IgG with the engagement of FcrRII
801     receptor. IgG purified from the ADE plasma was evaluated for enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection
802     of Raji cells. IgG-depleted plasma was also evaluated. (F) ADE plasma or (G) IgG purified from ADE
803     plasma (right) were evaluated for ADE on Raji cells in the presence or absence of anti-FcrRII antibody
804     CD32. Comparison of age (H), disease duration (I), and hospital stay (J) of 29 patients whose plasma
805     showed ADE effect and 193 patients whose plasma did not show ADE effect (green). P value was
806     calculated using non-parametric t test.
807
808     Figure 2. ADE is more likely to develop in elderly patients with high titers of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-
809     and S1-specific antibodies.
810     (A) SARS-CoV-2 NAb titers (ID50) and (B) RBD, S1-, and S2-specific binding antibodies of 29 ADE
811     patients and 193 Non-ADE patients are compared. P value was calculated using t test. (C) Kinetics of
812     SARS-CoV-2-specific ADE in plasma of six COVID-19 patients are shown. Plasma was collected at
813     different time points post-disease onset. (D) Kinetics of spike-binding antibodies (left Y axis) targeting
814     RBD, S1, and S2 in plasma of six COVID-19 patients exhibiting ADE are shown. Plasma diluted 1:400
815     was incubated with RBD, S1, or S2 protein. (E) Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs titers in plasma of six
816     COVID-19 patients whose plasma showed ADE are shown.

818     Figure 3. ADE was mediated by antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD subunits.
819     (A) Suppression of ADE of plasma by RBD (A) or S1 protein (B) of SARS-CoV-2 but not by RBD (C)
820     or S1 protein (D) of SARS-CoV viruses. Serially diluted patient plasma were pre-incubated with different
821     concentrations of proteins before evaluating ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection of Raji cells. Untreated
822     plasma was used as a positive control, and healthy donor plasma was used as a negative control. (E) ADE
823     mediated by plasma from six patients was inhibited by pre-incubation with 10 μg/ml SARS-CoV-2 RBD
824     but not SARS-CoV RBD.

827     Inhibition of ADE induced by plasma from patients using chloroquine (A) or EK peptide (B). Serially
828     diluted plasma was pre-incubated with different concentrations of chloroquine or EK1 peptide before
829     evaluating ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection of Raji cells. Patient plasma with ADE was used as a positive
830     control, and plasma from uninfected health donor was used as a negative control. (C) ADE mediated by
831     plasma from six patients was inhibited by 50 μM of EK1 peptide but not by chloroquine.. (D) ADE
832     plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients promoted syncytium formation. Plasma from uninfected
833     health donor was used as a negative control. The syncytium formation was specifically inhibited by EK1
834     peptide but not by chloroquine. (E) The statistical counts of syncytium formation induced by plasma
835     from three patients (8, 5, and 7) in the presence of EK1 peptide or chloroquine.
