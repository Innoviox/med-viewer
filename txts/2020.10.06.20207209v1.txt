          Background: Patients with severe COVID-19 have overwhelmed healthcare systems
          worldwide. We hypothesized that Machine Learning (ML) models could be used to predict
          risks at different stages of management (at diagnosis, hospital admission and ICU admission)
          and thereby provide insights into drivers and prognostic markers of disease progression and
          death.
          Methods: From a cohort of approx. 2.6 million citizens in the two regions of Denmark,
          SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed on subjects suspected for COVID-19 disease; 3944
          cases had at least one positive test and were subjected to further analysis. A cohort of SARS-
          CoV-2 positive cases from the United Kingdom Biobank was used for external validation.
          Findings: The ML models predicted the risk of death (Receiver Operation Characteristics –
          Area Under the Curve, ROC-AUC) of 0.904 at diagnosis, 0.818, at hospital admission and
          0.723 at Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Similar metrics were achieved for predicted
          risks of hospital and ICU admission and use of mechanical ventilation. We identified some
          common risk factors, including age, body mass index (BMI) and hypertension as driving
          factors, although the top risk features shifted towards markers of shock and organ
          dysfunction in ICU patients. The external validation indicated fair predictive performance
          for mortality prediction, but suboptimal performance for predicting ICU admission.
          Interpretation: ML may be used to identify drivers of progression to more severe disease
          and for prognostication patients in patients with COVID-19. Prognostic features included

          age, BMI and hypertension, although markers of shock and organ dysfunction became more
          important in more severe cases.
          We provide access to an online risk calculator based on these findings.

                                                             INTRODUCTION
          The COVID-19 pandemic has put severe strains on hospital systems around the world. As of
          October 1st, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that more than 34
          million patients are affected worldwide, and that the pandemic is the direct cause of more
          than 1 million deaths - a number that will likely rise as the pandemic progress.
          The unknown clinical features coupled with the speed of viral spreading creates an
          unfortunate situation where health care providers are lacking important diagnostic adjuncts
          such as accurate prediction models and data-driven insights into the drivers of disease
          progression.
          Several studies have now proposed prediction models based on a variety of clinical features.
          The majority of these are, however, trained and validated on national datasets from hospital
          admitted COVID-19 patients. While these may be of value locally, whether the classification
          ability transfers to other healthcare systems is questionable. As such, a recent review of
          Machine Learning (ML) models1, aimed at risk prediction in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients,
          found that the majority of studies were constructed on Chinese data with a high risk of bias as
          assessed by the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment tool (PROBAST)2. Furthermore,
          models often utilize data from hospital admitted SARS-CoV-2 positive patients only, which
          may skew results due to the lack of data from patients with milder disease trajectories.
          Finally, models are often developed for predictions at hospital admission, providing little
          insight into the effects of in-hospital management. This, in turn, hinders identification of
          optimal biomarkers and prognostic features of adverse outcomes, as these may change as the
          patient advance through the trajectory of the disease.
          The objective of this study is to construct and validate an ML model for SARS-CoV-2
          adverse outcome risk prediction on a European dataset from Denmark, with external

          validation in a United Kingdom (UK) dataset. Secondly, we seek to use the constructed
          models for identification of disease risk factors, including comorbidities, biomarkers and vital
          signs as the patient moves through the disease trajectory. As such, we seek to identify
          important clinical predictors of adverse outcomes at four timepoints or timeframes, based on
          accumulating available data: On diagnoses, on hospital admission (where applicable) and
          immediately before and after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU9), where applicable.
          Finally, we sought to create an online prediction tool to support rapid risk assessment upon
          COVID-19 diagnosis based on the most relevant data points.
          We hypothesized that ML can be leveraged to provide accurate outcome predictions for
          COVID-19 patients, and that including accumulating datapoints from available sources from
          Electronic Health Record (EHR) repositories in a combined model improves risk prediction
          as well as identification of relevant disease drivers at specific time points.
                                                                  METHODS
          The study was approved by the relevant legal and ethics boards. These included the Danish
          Patient Safety Authority (Styrelsen for Patientsikkerhed, approval #31-1521-257) and the
          Danish Data Protection Agency (Datatilsynet, approval #P-2020-320) as well as the UK
          Biobank (Application ID #60861) COVID-19 cohort. Under Danish law, approval from these
          agencies are required for access to and handling of patient sensitive data, including EHR
          records. Legal approval for the study was furthermore obtained from the Danish Capital
          Region (Region Hovedstaden).
          We conducted a prospective study by including all individuals undergoing a SARS-CoV-2
          test (nasal and/or pharyngeal swap subjected to Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
          testing) in the Capital and Zealand Regions (approximately 2.6 million citizens) of Denmark
          between March 1st, 2020 and June 16th 2020. Data inclusion was censored on June 16th.

          Patients were identified through their Central Person Registry (CPR) number, a unique
          numerical combination given to every Danish citizen, enabling linking of electronic health
          records (EHRs) with nationwide medical registry data.
          During the study period, all SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed at regional hospitals. Patients
          were referred for testing based on presence of symptoms albeit test strategies shifted towards
          the end of the inclusion period to include a wider screening indication.
          For cases with at least one positive tests, we extracted data from the bi-regional EHR system,
          including demographics, comorbidities and prescription medication. In-hospital data included
          laboratory results and vital signs.
          Supplementary Table S1 lists extracted comorbidities with their definitions, Supplementary
          Table S2 extracted laboratory values, and Supplementary Table S3 extracted temporal
          features (vital signs).
          For the purpose of external validation of the ML models, we extracted data from the UK
          biobank COVID-19 cohort. The UK biobank contains detailed healthcare information on
          500.000 UK citizens, of which 1650 have been tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. This cohort has
          recently been made available for the purpose of COVID-19 research by the UK biobank
          consortium3.
          Prediction models
          ML models were trained and validated on the Danish dataset. A subset of models sharing
          identical data fields (e.g. age, comorbidities etc.) between the Danish and UK cohorts were
          subsequently externally validated on the UK biobank dataset.
          We constructed ML prediction models by including available data for patients up to and
          including the selected time frames or time points. These time frames or points were
               -    At time of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (all patients, Diagnosis model)

               -    The first 12 hours of hospital admission (Admission model)
               -    12 hours up to ICU admission (Pre-ICU model)
               -    12 hours after ICU admission (Post-ICU model).
          Models were trained to predict one of four events, where applicable:
               -    Hospital admission (SARS-CoV-2 positive patients)
               -    ICU admission (Diagnosed and hospital admitted patients)
               -    Mechanical ventilation (Diagnosed, hospital and ICU admitted patients)
               -    Death (all patients)
          For each task, we trained with different feature sets to study how incrementally adding data
          affects model performance as well as to gain insight into drivers of disease progression:
               -    Base models: Age, sex and body mass index (BMI).
               -    Comorbidities: Base model and comorbidities (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1)
               -    Temporal features: Comorbidities model and temporal features (Supplementary Table
                    S3)
               -    In-hospital laboratory tests: Temporal features model and in-hospital lab tests
                    (Supplementary Table S2).
          For the purpose of external validation, data points were available in the UK biobank
          matching those of the base and comorbidities models. In-hospital models could not be
          externally validated due to lack of availability of these data points in the UK biobank.
          ML models
          We used random forests (RFs)4, implemented in the open-source machine learning library
          scikit-learn5. Because each individual tree is trained on a bootstrap sample, there is training
          data that can be used to compute the out-of-bag (OOB) error, an estimate of the RF’s
          performance.

          All models were evaluated on the Danish set using 5-fold cross-validation. The folds were
          stratified to ensure that the splits are representative of the full cohort. For each split, we
          conducted grid search on the available training data fold to tune the hyperparameters of the
          RF models for each prediction task. The OOB error served as the selection criterion. We
          varied the number of decision trees in the ensemble in 100, 500, 1000 and the maximum
          depth of the individual decision trees in 3,4,7,9,11. When splitting a node, all input features
          were checked.
          For computing the Receiver Operating Characteristics Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC)
          and precision/recall AUC (PR-AUC), the outputs for all test folds were combined, resulting
          in predictions for the entire data set.
          For evaluation on the UK data, models were trained on the entire Danish data set. As before,
          for each model, a grid search based on the OOB error was performed on the same parameter
          grid. Each model was then evaluated on the entire UK cohort.
          Post-hoc analysis of the use of the predictive variables across all decision trees in the RF
          allows us to derive a measure of feature importance. Feature importance was calculated by
          the mean decrease in impurity (MDI). The measure takes into account how often a feature is
          used when classifying the training data points and how well it splits the training data points
          when being used. For each predictive variable the importance was computed as the mean
          over the feature importance for each fold. The top-10 or top-20 (depending on the model)
          were extracted and visualized. The correlations of these features were then computed across
          the entire dataset.
          Missing data
          Missing data was considered missing at random.

          Percentages of available data in the Danish cohort are presented in supplementary Table S4.
          Missing values for BMI were imputed by using k-nearest neighbour imputation using age and
          sex6, with k=100. Other missing data points were set to “not available” for the purpose of ML
          modelling and deleted by case wise deletion for group comparisons.
          Data presentation and statistical testing
          Continuous data is presented as medians (interquartile range) and compared using the Mann-
          Whitney U test. Categorical data is presented as percentages and compared using the Chi-
          square test.
          ML model performances are presented as ROC-AUC for Positive and Negative predictive
          value and precision/recall. Model comparisons were performed by the deLong test7.
           The p-values for comparisons of outcome groups are provided for reference only. As these
          comparisons are not part of the study hypotheses, p-values are presented without post-hoc
          correction for multiple testing and should be interpreted as such.
          In addition, calibration curves are presented for the combined test folds and the external
          validation data. For each calibration plot, the predictions were grouped using quantile-based
          binning.

          A total of 3944 individuals had at least one positive SARS-CoV-2 test in the two Danish
          regions and were included in the study. These were supplemented by the 1650 patients from
          the UK biobank used for external model validation.
          Among the Danish cases, 1359 (34.5%) required hospitalization, and 181 (4.6%) intensive
          care. A total of 324 patients (8.2%) died.
          Demographics and comorbidities are summarized in Table 1, selected laboratory values and
          vital signs in Table 2. Demographics information for the UK biobank external validation
          cohort is presented in supplementary Table S5.
          When compared to non-hospitalized patients, hospital admitted patients were older and more
          likely to be male.
          A number of comorbidities were overrepresented in the admitted subgroup. These included
          hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, arrythmias, stroke, chronic
          obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, osteoporosis, neurological disease, cancer,
          chronic kidney failure and use of dialysis. Hospitalized patients were more likely to be
          smokers (Table 2).
          For hospitalized patients requiring ICU admission vs. hospitalized patients without ICU
          admission, only male sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), dementia and hypertension differed
          between patients. ICU-admitted patients were furthermore more likely to be smokers. When
          compared to survivors, non-survivors were older and male (Table 1).
          Non-survivors were furthermore more likely to suffer from hypertension, diabetes, ischemic
          heart disease, heart Failure, arrythmias, stroke, COPD or asthma, osteoporosis, Dementia,
          Mental disorders, Neurological disease, cancer, chronic kidney failure and use of dialysis.

          When compared to non-admitted, admitted patients differed significantly in all measured
          values (Table 2). Among those hospitalised, those admitted to the ICU had derangements in
          many variables (Table 2). The same was observed for non-survivors compared with survivors
          (Table 2).
          ML models prediction
          ML models are presented in Table 3 and graphically depicted in supplementary Figure S1
          (Diagnosis model), Supplementary Figure S2 (Admission model), Supplementary Figure S3
          (Pre-ICU model) and Supplementary Figure S4 (Post-ICU model).
          Base models deployed on the time of diagnosis were able to predict hospital admission with a
          ROC-AUC of 0.815, ICU admission 0.785, ventilator treatment 0.801 and death 0.904 (Table
          3 and Supplementary Figure S1).
          Adding information on patient comorbidities increased the predictive ability for all outcomes.
          Models deployed at hospital admission achieved ROC-AUC scores ranging from 0.678 to
          0.818 for the selected outcomes (Table 3 and Supplementary Figure S2). Adding information
          on comorbidities, temporal features and hospital laboratory tests increased model
          performance for ICU admission, use of mechanical ventilation and death.
          Models deployed pre- or post-ICU admission achieved ROC-AUC’s from 0.587 to 0.736
          (Table 3 and Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Figure S4).
          The calibration curves (supplementary figures S7 and S8) show that the models are well
          calibrated when looking at all diagnosed subjects and at patients admitted to the hospital.
          When restricted to patients admitted to ICU, the calibration gets worse as expected due to
          smaller sample size. Ventilator treatment could not be predicted accurately, and the
          calibration curves reflect this.

          External validation results (Supplementary Table S6) on UK data indicated an overall
          reduction in model classification ability. For diagnosed patients, ROC-AUCs were 0.664 for
          predicting hospital admission, 0.548 for predicting ICU admission and 0.724 for predicting
          mortality. Inspection of the calibration curves (Supplementary Figure S7) shows that the
          models are only slightly worse calibrated for the UK data, meaning that the model outputs
          approximately the correct probability for individual patients, despite the degradation in ROC-
          AUC.
          As patients progressed through the disease severity trajectories, mortality prediction remained
          in the area of 0.625 – 0.674 (Supplementary Table S6).
          Detection of important features and drivers of disease progression.
          Results of the drivers of disease progression feature detection analysis for each of the
          selected timepoints are depicted in Figure 1 (diagnoses model) and Figure 2 (admission
          model) as well as Supplementary Figure S4 (pre-ICU model) and Supplementary Figure S5
          (post-ICU model).
          For diagnosed patients (Figure 1), age and BMI were the most relevant features for risk of
          hospital admission and death, whereas hypertension was the most prominent risk feature for
          ICU admission and ventilator treatment.
          Among comorbidities, hypertension was the most important feature for predicting ICU
          admission.
          For admitted patients (Figure 2) the most relevant drivers of disease progression were age,
          BMI, hypertension and the presence of dementia. When the full dataset was analysed, lab
          tests indicating aspects of cell dysfunction (Lactic dehydrogenase, LDH), kidney dysfunction
          (Blood urea nitrogen and Creatinine), the inflammatory response (C-reactive protein, CRP),

          and liver damage (Alanine Aminotransferase, ALT) were identified as important prognostic
          markers for disease progression.
          For ICU models (Supplementary Figure S5 and S6), relevant disease progression features
          again included age and BMI as well as comorbidities including hypertension, heart failure
          and neurological disease. When the full dataset was analysed, disease progression drivers
          included features reflecting insufficient respiration and metabolism (pulse oximetry oxygen
          saturation, pO2 values and slopes over time), as well as BUN and CRP levels.
                                                                DISCUSSION
          In this study, we analyse prognostic and factors associated with disease progression in 3944
          SARS-CoV-2 positive patients by constructing an interpretable ML framework. In contrast to
          previous studies, these included diagnosed patients outside hospitals, and thus included the
          entire spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the 2.6 million regional population.
          Results indicate that by focusing on a limited number of demographic variables, including
          age, gender and BMI, it is possible to predict the risk of hospital and ICU admission, use of
          mechanical ventilation and death as early as at the time of diagnosis. Adding information on
          comorbidity to the model increased performance, indicating that these features play a
          prognostic role in the outcome of patients as they progress through the disease trajectory.
          As such, results from the ML feature detection indicate that comorbidity factors such as
          hypertension and diabetes are driving factors of adverse outcome, which is in line with
          reports from other cohort studies8-10. The role of hypertension is further underlined by reports
          indicating a role of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as an entry point
          for the SARS-CoV211. Whether COVID-19 interacts unfavourably with hypertension per se,
          or whether this risk is simply a manifestation of reduced tolerance to severe infection and
          hypoxia is currently debated12.

          Furthermore, BMI was identified as a major feature of adverse outcome, as also reported by
          others13-15. Whether this is due to a reduced respiratory capacity or chronic impairment of the
          immune system through alterations in tumour necrosis factor and interferon secretion
          associated with obesity, is also currently debated16. Caution should, however, be taken when
          analysing these results, as the median observed differences between groups were minor and
          may not be clinically relevant. Furthermore, data imputation may have impacted on these
          results.
          The addition of more data points, including temporal features and lab tests improved the
          model’s predictive value for hospitalized patients. Group comparisons indicated alterations of
          a plethora of laboratory tests for admitted patients, including features of immune activation
          and organ dysfunction. Interestingly, laboratory tests differed to a lesser extent between ICU
          and non-ICU patients, except for CRP levels, lymphocyte counts, LDH, ALT, neutrophil, D-
          dimer and ferritin levels as well as arterial blood gas values. As expected, ICU admitted
          patients had lower oxygen saturation and higher respiratory rates, likely reflecting the acute
          respiratory distress from COVID-19 pneumonia.
          Feature analysis indicated that strong prognostic markers expectedly included CRP levels,
          but also markers of organ damage, including kidney injury (creatinine and blood urea
          nitrogen), liver injury (ALAT), cell damage (LDH), anaemia (haemoglobin levels) as well as
          ferritin levels. These, as well as vital signs and arterial blood gas values superseded many of
          the comorbidities in feature importance once the patient progressed through hospital and ICU
          admission. This again indicates that drivers and prognostic markers of adverse outcomes
          represent a dynamic field affected by the patient’s current point on the disease trajectory, and
          that differential values should be considered when risk-assessing COVID-19 patients
          depending on their current status (e.g. in hospital, in ICU etc.). A caveat is, however, that
          multiple comorbidities and advanced age may resulted in decisions by patients, relatives or

          clinicians limiting the use of life-support, and thus potentially precluding them from ICU
          admission and reducing the effect of comorbidities and age on model predictions.
          Kidney injury has previously been reported in patients with COVID-1917,18. Our finding that
          markers of kidney injury may be important at hospital admission supports the notion that
          COVID-19 associated kidney injury plays an important pathophysiological role.
          The importance of LDH for COVID-19 patients has previously been reported in other ML19
          as well as clinical studies20. These results are supported by the feature detection from this
          study, indicating that LDH levels serve as an important prognostic marker on hospital
          admission, although its value is superseded by other biomarkers when the patient advance to
          the ICU stage. As LDH can be seen as a general marker of cell and organ damage with a
          reported prognostic value for mortality in ICU patients21, these findings likely indicate a
          general organ affection associated with COVID-19 disease progression.
          Abnormal liver function tests, including ALAT, has previously been associated with COVID-
          19 disease severity22. As such, reports have indicated the presence of elevated liver enzymes
          in both severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases23. Whether this is a function of viral
          infection, shock or a consequence of hepatotoxic treatments deployed during treatment is still
          not clear24.
          Ferritin levels have previously been associated with COVID-1925, presumably due to its role
          in immunomodulation and association with the cytokine storm response seen in critical
          illness26.
          Taken together, the feature importance of laboratory tests indicating affection of several
          organ systems indicates that COVID-19 disease severity follows a predictable pattern
          characterized by multi-organ affection (albeit not always dysfunction), which is in line with
          previous findings27.

          Once patients progress to the ICU stage, feature detection indicated a switch towards vital
          signs and biomarkers indicating that the severity of respiratory failure, shock and
          inflammatory markers were the most important features of risk of death (Supplementary
          Figure S5 and Supplementary Figure S6).
          When the feature importance of all models is analysed, the results indicate that COVID-19
          outcomes are at the time of diagnoses largely predictable through a relatively limited number
          of features, dominated by age, BMI and comorbidities, effectively proxies for frailty.
          As patients follow their disease trajectories, differential features supersede each other in
          prognostic importance, and prognostic models should thus consider the patient’s place in the
          disease trajectory.
          The results of the external validation did, however, show an overall reduction in the model’s
          classification ability when the UK biobank cohort was analysed. This will impact on the
          generalizability of the presented models, but results should be interpreted with caution.
          As such, the UK cohort was assembled for the purpose of biobanking studies, and thus
          comprise a highly selected subset of patients, whereas the Danish cohort was population wide
          in the two analysed geographical regions. Demographic data also highlights differences in the
          two populations, including an age difference between groups. Actually, when predicting
          death for ICU patients, where demographics are similar, we do not observe a reduction in
          model performance.
          The differences in results can be explained by the change of the underlying data distribution.
          The results demonstrate that caution should be exercised when evaluating whether ML
          models are useful for local health care practitioners if developed on other cohorts, especially
          when developed on early phase COVID-19 data. As such, significant variations in national
          factors such as isolation policies and triage for ICU and mechanical ventilation, population
          demographics etc. may impact on results. This notion is supported by the finding that our

          model retained reasonable classification ability for mortality in UK patients, but failed to
          predict ICU admission risk.
          These results could thus indicate that potential users of ML models for COVID-19 patients
          should carefully examine the generalizability of the training cohort and healthcare
          infrastructure where patients originated from and compare these with local features prior to
          model usage.
          Our study has several limitations. The number of patients available for this analysis was
          limited, and additional patient data could change the results. Secondly, we have extracted a
          subset of clinical variables from the EHR system. Analysing other features could affect the
          model. Furthermore, the changing criteria for SARS-CoV-2 testing associated with the course
          of the pandemic, likely also affects the results.
          Even with these limitations, we may conclude that ML may be leveraged to perform outcome
          prediction in COVID-19 patients, as well as serve as a potential tool for identifying drivers
          and prognostic markers.

          Table 2: Temporal features (laboratory tests and vital signs). The table presents information
          on the full cohort (admitted and non-admitted SARS-CoV-2 positive patients) as well as
          subgroups admitted to a hospital and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) respectively. Furthermore,
          differential temporal features between survivors and non-survivors (in-hospital mortality) is
          presented. Continuous variables are presented as medians with (interquartile range)
          **p<0.001 when subgroups are compared (e.g. hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized, ICU vs.
          non-ICU, survivors vs. non- survivors).

          Table 3: Main results from the prediction models. Predictions were performed with data
          available from four different time frames in the patient disease trajectories (left column): On
          diagnosis (Diagnoses model), On hospital admission and 12-hours into admission (Admission
          model), 12 hours leading up to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission (Pre-ICU model) and 12
          hours after ICU admission (post-ICU model).
          Models were trained to predict risk of hospital admission, ICU admission, ventilator
          treatment and death (top row).
          All models were trained with incremental data, starting with age, gender and Body Mass
          Index, then adding comorbidity information, temporal features (e.g. vital signs) and finally by
          adding hospital laboratory tests where applicable. Please see supplementary tables S1 and S2
          for data definitions.
          Performance metrics are presented as the Receiver Operating Characteristics Area Under the
          Curve (ROC-AUC) for True/False positive rates (TPR/FPR) and Precision/Recall (Pre/Rec).

          Supplementary Table S5: Demographic information on the group SARS-CoV-2 positive
          patients from the United Kingdom biobank cohort used for external validation. The table
          presents information on the full cohort (admitted and non-admitted SARS-CoV-2 positive
          patients) as well as subgroups admitted to a hospital and Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
          respectively. Furthermore, differential demographics between survivors and non-survivors
          (in-hospital mortality) is presented. Continuous variables are presented as medians with
          (interquartile range)
          **p<0.001 when subgroups are compared (e.g. hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized, ICU vs.
          non-ICU, survivors vs. non- survivors).
