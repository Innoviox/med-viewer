          Abstract
          Background
          Abbreviations are commonly used in medical records to save time and space but use in
          prescriptions can be a reason for communication failures and preventable harm during
          healthcare delivery. Nearly 5% of medication errors can be attributable to abbreviation
          use. Prescriptions need to be clear so that nurses and pharmacists can correctly interpret
          intentions of doctors. For patient safety, hospitals should implement a process for uniform
          use of approved abbreviations, such as through use of an approved list or never-use list of
          abbreviations and symbols.
          Local Problem
          In the hospital under study, there was no system of avoiding error prone abbreviations
          while prescribing to prevent medical errors. Hence, an interventional study was done to
          quantify and reduce incidence of error prone abbreviations.
          Methods
          The study design was pre-post interventional / quasi-experimental design to assess the impact
          of never use list and standardized abbreviations. The study was conducted after ethical

          approval from Institute Ethics Committee. Pre intervention data was collected by a
          retrospective closed in-patient medical record review. Post interventional incidence of error
          prone abbreviations was determined and the effectiveness of the same was assessed by using
          statistical analysis.
          Intervention
          An approved ‘Never use’ list and standardized abbreviations were developed and poster
          copies were affixed in inpatient wards, doctors were educated and poster pamphlets were also
          distributed.
          Results
          Incidence of error abbreviations in inpatient prescription were 47.5% and ‘Never Use’ list of
          abbreviation led to a statistically significant reduction of error-prone abbreviation by 8.2%
          from 47.5% to 43.6% (P\0.006)
          Conclusion
          ‘Never Use’ lists are effective in reducing incidence of common error-prone abbreviations
          and discipline wise variation is observed. Adoption of such lists is highly recommended. The
          lists should be comprehensive, regularly updated and educational interventions should be
          comprehensive and integration into patient medical charts and pocket friendly flash cards
          may be provided for better outcomes. Enforcing a policy to prohibit the use of EPAs while
          prescribing will also be helpful.

          INTRODUCTION
          Problem Description
          Abbreviations are commonly used in medical records to save time and space. However,
          abbreviations can be confusing and may convey different meaning in different contexts,
          e.g., DOA is interpreted as either ‘date of admission’ or ‘dead on arrival’ by various
          clinical or surgical disciplines. Good medical practice warrants that doctors keep clear,
          accurate and legible medical records to provide good clinical care and enable correct
          interpretation by pharmacists and nurses. Inappropriate abbreviations in prescriptions may
          alter intended therapeutic outcomes and even harm patients. [1] Communication failures
          often result from non-uniform or non-standardized use of abbreviations, symbols, and
          codes and cause patient safety incidents. [2] Nearly 5% of errors reported were
          attributable to abbreviation use. [3]
          Available knowledge
          The problem of inappropriate use of abbreviations has been raised by many medication
          safety organizations such as National Coordinating Council for Medication Error
          Reporting and Prevention of the USA, Institute of Safe Medication Practices, etc. National
          Board for Accreditation of Hospitals and Healthcare providers (NABH) quality standards
          recommends standardized list of approved and documented abbreviations for medication
          orders for uniform use throughout to ensure that the abbreviation has only one meaning
          thereby avoiding medical errors. Dangerous/ error prone abbreviations (EPA’s) should not
          be used. The standardized approved list of abbreviations, symbols, and dose designations
          should be based on best national and international practices. [4] Joint Commission
          International (JCI) accreditation standards recommend developing and/or adopt a do-not-
          use list of abbreviations and symbols. [2] EPAs and correct way of abbreviations are also
          recommended by ISMP (Institute for Safe Medication Practices) and ACSQH (Australian
          Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care). [5]
          Rationale
          In the hospital under study, there was no system of avoiding error prone abbreviations
          while prescribing to prevent medical errors.
          Specific Aims
          An interventional study was done to quantify and reduce incidence of error prone
          abbreviations.

                                                                                                                                  4
          In the hospital under study, being a multi-specialty hospital, there were many specialty
          inpatient wards. Being hospital administrators, the researchers were aware that there was no
          formal mechanism in place to address potential harm by error prone abbreviations. Since
          broad specialty admitted most of the patients, the intervention was envisaged in these wards.
          The team involved in the work comprised of hospital administrators who were administrative
          in charges of the inpatient wards expected to ensure smooth and safe hospital operations
          related to patient care.
          Study of the Intervention(s)
          Review of literature had indicated that many medication safety organisations had suggested
          use of standardized list of approved and documented abbreviations for medication orders.
          Use of do-not-use lists has also been recommended. Hence, an intervention of introducing
          never use list was decided.
          To ensure the effect establish whether the observed outcomes were due to the intervention,
          pre-post study of prescriptions of the same inpatient areas was conducted and results
          compared.
          Study Design
          The study design was pre-post interventional study / quasi-experimental study design to
          assess the impact of never use list and standardised abbreviations.
          Study Settings
          This prospective study was conducted in inpatient wards of broad specialties of medicine,
          paediatrics and surgery of a tertiary care hospital.
          Study Period
          The duration of this study was four months from July to November 2019. The objectives
          were to develop and implement a standardised “never use” list of error prone abbreviations
          and standardised abbreviations based on international bets practices and impact its list on
          incidence of prescription of error-prone abbreviations. The study was conducted after ethical
          approval from Institute Ethics Committee (IECPG-196).
          Sample Size
          A pilot study showed that incidence of error-prone abbreviations in prescriptions varied from
          8% to 40 % in broad specialties studied. One thousand three hundred prescriptions were
          studied - 600 during pre-interventional phase and 700 prescriptions in post interventional
          phase to identify a 10% change (before and after studies) in use of error-prone abbreviations in
          prescriptions taking 5% margin of error, 95% confidence in correlation with similar study in
          Hong Kong study which was done by Nithushi R, Samaranayake & Dixon S.

          Measures, Methodology and Intervention
          Initially, a retrospective closed in-patient medical record review of patients from disciplines
          of medicine, paediatric and surgery was conducted using stratified random sampling to
          determine the incidence of these error prone abbreviations compared against lists by ISMP
          and ACSQH. Based on results of the pilot study, existing literature and inputs from experts in
          hospital administrations and patient safety, an approved ‘Never use’ list and standardised
          abbreviations were developed in the form of poster. Copies of these posters were affixed in
          inpatient wards of medicine, surgery and paediatric discipline, doctors were educated about
          EPAs and correct method of prescribing and poster pamphlets were also distributed. The post
          intervention data collection for calculating incident of error prone abbreviations in
          prescriptions was started two weeks after intervention.
          Statistical Analysis
          Impact was assessed by comparing pre and post interventional results by data analysis using
          SPSS version 20. Paired t-test was applied to evaluate the statistical significance between pre
          and post interventional results.
          Ethical Considerations
          The study was conducted after ethical approval from Institute Ethics Committee (IECPG-
          196).
          RESULTS
          Never use” list of error prone abbreviations (EPAs)
           By comparing the different international safety organisation, a list of 12 most error prone
          abbreviations was adopted which was frequently used in our hospital set up and the same list
          was considered as “Never use” list of error prone abbreviations (Table 1).

          Impact on incidence of EPAs
          Among the 678 prescriptions that were selected for review, 78 prescriptions were excluded
          from the analysis because they contained non-drug items only. We reviewed 600
          prescriptions in Phase II (post interventional phase), comprising a total of 2950 drug items.
          Pre-Intervention Incidence of EPAs
          Pre intervention incidence of error prone abbreviation was higher in prescription of discipline
          of surgery (66%) followed by paediatrics (54.8%) and medicine (53.4%). Top three EPAs
          were ‘Inj’ instead of Injection (17%), followed by ‘BD’ instead of twice a day (10.8%) and
          OD instead of once daily (9.6%). (Table 2)
          Post-Intervention Incidence of EPAs
          Analysis of pre and post interventional results revealed statistically significant reduction
          8.2% in overall use of EPAs from 47.5% to 43.6% (P\0.006) (Paired t-test).

          DISCUSSION
          Key findings and Interpretations
          The use of inappropriate abbreviations in prescriptions may alter intended therapeutic
          outcomes and even cause unnecessary harm. [5] Use of inappropriate abbreviations is one of
          the reasons for medication error. Hospitals opting for accreditation have preventive measures
          such as use of error prone abbreviations or do not use lists to guide prescribing behaviours.
          Others lack such initiatives. In Sudan, only 5% hospitals among 41 Khartoum State hospitals
          had a list of error-prone abbreviations. [6] A survey in the Pakistan established knowledge
          gap among medicine trainees regarding meaning and usage of common medical abbreviations
          where 93% used ‘IU’ instead of entire phrase ‘international unit’. [7]
          Use of error prone abbreviations is pervasive but it incidence rates vary. In a multi-hospital
          Australian study hospitals, 76.9% patients had one or more error prone abbreviations used in
          prescribing, with 8.4% of orders containing at least one error prone abbreviation and 29.6%
          of these considered to be high risk for causing significant harm. [8] In another study in
          Australia, paediatric prescription audits identified error-prone abbreviations on 5% of audited
          medication orders. These were Qd, OD, U, mcg, trailing zeros or failure to include a leading

                                                                                                                                  8
          zero when the dose is less than a one. [9] Audits in a Sri Lankan hospital, showed use of
          following error-prone abbreviations - μg (microgram), mcg (microgram), u (units), cc (cubic
          centimeter), OD (once a day), @ sign, d (days/daily), m (morning) and n (night) - at a rate of
          17.4%, 0.1%, 1.9%, 0.2%, 0.2%, 4.9%, 23.5%, 4.4% and 15.8% respectively among all
          prescriptions reviewed. [10] In our study, overall incidence of error prone abbreviations
          before intervention was 47.5%. Top three EPAs were ‘Inj’ instead of Injection (17%),
          followed by ‘BD’ instead of twice a day (10.8%) and OD instead of once daily (9.6%).
          Common abbreviations recorded in acute care settings in Saudi Arabia were ‘IJ for injection’
          (28.6%), ‘SC for subcutaneous’ (17.4%) and ‘OD for once daily’ (5.8%). [11] In another
          study in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, use of unsafe abbreviations in 7000 medication orders was
          28.3%. These abbreviations were used mainly by interns (41%), residents (33.6%), registrars
          (22%), and a few consultants (3.2%). The most common abbreviations used were ‘‘cc’’
          instead of ‘‘mL’’ (50%), ‘‘@’’ instead of ‘‘at’’ (34%), and ‘‘DC’’ instead of ‘‘discontinue’’
          (32%). [12] It appears that globally, the incidence somewhat inversely correlates with the
          socio-economic development of the countries.
          In our study, introduction of never-use lists and standardised abbreviations have been
          effective in reducing incidence of EPA’s in prescriptions by 8.2% from 58.1% to 52.9%. In a
          similar pharmacist-led educational interventional study in Saudi Arabia, overall incidence of
          high risk abbreviations was reduced by 52% (53.6% to 25.5%). [11] The educational
          intervention was more comprehensive compared to that in our study. It included insertion of a
          printed list of abbreviations on brightly coloured paper into medical records/patient charts,
          pocket-sized flash cards provided for staff, laminated copies of list was attached to the back
          of the physician’s order divider in medical records. [11] These were in addition to the
          interventions undertaken in our study. A two phased intervention based on education and a
          hospital-wide policy on prohibition on use of unsafe abbreviations yielded 65% reduction
          from a baseline of 28.3%. [12] In our study, reductions in incidents of individual EPA’s was
          INJ/ IJ (4.1%), ug (31.3%) and IU (35%) study compared to reductions in EPAs in another
          similar study in Hong Kong on effectiveness of a ‘Do Not Use’ list that were 35.7% for ‘ug’,
          92% for ‘od or OD’ and 69.2% for ‘IU’. [1]
          It has been suggested introduction of such lists was effective but success largely depends a
          comprehensive EPA list. [13] Historically, these abbreviations crop up with alarming
          frequency. [14] Furthermore, frequent review and update of ‘‘Never Use’ list and frequent
          reminders recommended are recommended but absolute elimination may be difficult.
          Interventional study on use of electronic health records (EHR) technology has helped

                                                                                                                                  9
          eliminate error prone abbreviation from a pre-intervention incidence rate of 41% to 0%. [15]
          However, implement of EHRs is difficult as it not only involves costly technology, its
          maintenance and training but in the fundamental way how a doctor behaves while
          prescribing. It is quite different from scribbling notes possible even while on patient rounds.
          Limitations
          Limitations of study were that all possible error-prone abbreviations were not included, the
          post intervention study duration was limited to three months and sustainability could not be
          checked beyond that.
          Conclusion
          ‘Never Use’ lists are effective in reducing incidents of common error-prone abbreviations,
          discipline wise variation is observed and adoption of such lists is highly recommended.
          However, the lists should be comprehensive, regularly updated and educational interventions
          should be more comprehensive with integration into patient medical charts and pocket
          friendly flash cards may also be provided for better outcomes. Enforcing a policy to prohibit
          the use of EPAs while prescribing will also be helpful. The study adds to the research domain
          by establishing the impact of never use list of EPAs and opens avenues for further research
          on more comprehensive intervention and a policy inhibiting use of error prone abbreviations.
