Abstract
Multivariate datasets with a clustered structure are the natural
framework for, e.g., multicentre clinical trials. We propose a number
of methods aimed at detecting clusters with outlying correlation
coefficients. While the methods can be used in a variety of settings,
we focus mainly on their application to central statistical monitoring of
clinical trials. In particular, we consider the issue of detecting centers
(or other clusters of patients such as regions) with outlying correlation
coefficients for bivariate data in a multicenter clinical trial. It appears
that, in that context, the proposed methods perform well, as we show
by using a simulation study and a number of real life datasets.

1         Introduction

We focus on the problem of detecting centers with outlying correlation
coefficients for bivariate data in a multicenter clinical trial. For example,
observing many subjects with a large weight and short height or vice
versa in a center may raise suspicion, even if both univariate distributions
of height and weight for that center look reasonable. This problem is of
interest in the context of central statistical monitoring 1 (CSM) of clinical
trials, where outlying values for the correlation in a center may point to
data quality issues that are worth investigating. These issues may include
data fabrication, as it is well-known that the multivariate structure of the
data is much harder to imitate than the univariate one 2 .
  Thus, from a data-fabrication point of view, tests that focus on
the multivariate structure of the data are essential in a CSM toolkit.
Construction of multivariate tests for central statistical monitoring
is challenging as it brings in issues related to dimensionality and
parametrization. If many variables are available, the number of dimensions
can be daunting. Also, multivariate distributions require more parameters
and are harder to test for.
  In this paper we focus on a simplified setting: we consider pairs of
continuous variables, and assume the bivariate normal distribution as an
underlying data-generating mechanism in each center.

   The aims of this paper include (i) description of suitable data models,
both in absence and in presence of outlying centers, (ii) formulation of
various statistical tests for detection of outlying centers, (iii) investigation
of the performance of these tests in a simulation study, and, finally, (iv)
illustration of the methods in a number of real data cases.
  The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes suitable statistical
models and formulates the detection problem. In Section 3, we describe
the developed detection methods. Section 4 presents simulation results.
In Section 5, we apply the developed methods in three different settings:
raw datasets as encountered in central statistical monitoring practice, a
biometric multicenter dataset on sports teams, and a set of deliberately
fabricated datasets. Section 6 closes the paper with a discussion of
different aspects of the described methods, mainly in terms of their
performance in different applications.



2 Data models and detection problem

2.1 Multicenter correlated data

The starting point for formalizing the problem is the description of the
null-hypothesis case, i.e., the neutral setting where the centers have a
consistent and plausible correlation structure described by a particular
statistical model.
  We propose a hierarchical model that describes the data in each center
and, additionally, the way the correlation structure behaves across centers.
In particular, we consider N centers. Each center c has nc pairs (Xi , Yi ),
generated from a bivariate normal distribution,

  The motivation for this model is two-fold. A bivariate normal
distribution is the most general and simplest model that can be assumed
to hold, at least approximately, or after transformation, for pairs of
continuous random variables. On the other hand, the normal model for the
Fisher z-transformed correlation parameters is inspired by Fisher’s result
on the variability of the Pearson correlation coefficient 3,4 ,

  observed across independent replications of a bivariate normal model of
size n and correlation parameter ρ. In particular, z(r) has approximately
a normal distribution with mean µρ = arctanh(ρ) and standard deviation
√ 1 . It is therefore natural to allow a normal variability not for ρc , but
  n−3
for z(ρc ).
  While equation (1) completes the multicenter structure, it is equation
(2) that is crucial in defining the correlation structure across centers, and
with respect to which we can assess outlyingness. In equation (2) we
allow random deviations from the overall µρ to capture, e.g., unobserved
differences in center-specific populations 5,6 .
  For wider applicability, we can also consider a more flexible version of
equation (1), in which each center c has center-specific parameters µX,c ,
µY,c , σX,c and σY,c .
  However, since the correlations are defined independently for each
center, those other center-specific parameters have no influence on the
distribution of the center-specific correlations in equation (2).

2.2          Detection problem

Our goal is to detect centers that are not compatible with the null model
defined by (2). To illustrate the ideas, and for the sake of simplicity, we
consider only a specific type of deviation, the so-called hybrid model. Of
course, the methods proposed are not limited to this specific deviation
model.
  In the hybrid model we consider a mixture of two types of centers:
a majority N0 that represents normal centers, and a minority N1 of
”contaminant” centers that represent outliers (N = N0 + N1 , N0 > N1 ).
All centers follow (2), but with different location parameters: for the
majority we set µρ = arctanh(ρ0 ), while for the contaminant centers we
assume a different location parameter defined by µρ = arctanh(ρ1 ).
   An example of model densities for ρc is shown in Figure 1.

p-value is smaller than the 0.05 threshold (other choices of the significance
level are of course possible).
  If all centers conform with the null model, the p-values should have a
uniform distribution and flagging a center that has p < 0.05 should lead
to a procedure where at most 5% of the centers would be falsely rejected
(false positives).
  On the other hand, if a few centers conform with an alternative
parameter, these should be associated with small p-values.


3      Detection methods

Broadly speaking, we consider two types of detection methodologies:
methods that are directly related to estimation of the null model, which we
refer to as Fisher scale methods, and the so-called fixed margin methods
with a somewhat different rationale, as described in Section 3.2.

3.1      Fisher scale method
This method is based on direct estimation of the model defined by equation
(2) on the Fisher scale. In this method we explicitly account for center
sizes, and we denote wc = nc − 3 and rc for the correlation coefficient of
center c.
   We obtain estimates µ̂ and σ̂ as the arguments that maximize the
likelihood
                                                                              2

                                          √    e                nc −3 +σ

approximation to the distribution of Fisher’s z transform.
  Each center then gets its associated score, given by Uc = √z(r  c )−µ̂

and an associated p-value by using the standard normal reference

and proceeding as in a two-sided hypothesis test, i.e., we compute
p = 2 min(P (Z < Uc ), 1 − P (Z > Uc )), where Z is a standard normal
variable. As mentioned in Section 2.2, the decision to flag a center is based
on checking whether p < 0.05.
  The general idea of the Fisher scale method is thus to estimate the
parameters of model (2) based on the data. It is a reasonable approach
conditional on the null model being valid for the data at hand.
  For an alternative setting, such as the hybrid model, it is reasonable
to make the working assumption that the estimated model is a
valid approximation of the null model component provided that the
contamination rate is small (say, up to 5 − 10%). Hence, the estimated
model can be used as a reference to assess outlyingness.


3.2      Fixed margin approach
It is known that in the case of a bivariate normal, the distribution of the
sample variances and the distribution of the Pearson correlation coefficient
are not independent 7 8 , so that a test on sample variances and a test on
correlations would not be independent. This is further compounded by the
observation that in real situations, individual centers often include patients
from a subpopulation that has different characteristics than the overall
population across centers 5 , leading to large differences in variance across
centers.
   For instance, considering patient height and weight, some centers could
be located in cities that have a relatively homogeneous population (hence,
little variability in height and weight, and a modest correlation between
them), while other centers could have a more heterogeneous population
(and a stronger correlation between height and weight). Since the test on
correlation is meant to be used as one of many tests, among which tests
on marginal variances, it may be warranted to create a test on correlation
that is independent on the marginal variance.

  The fixed margin approach uncouples the correlation from one of the
marginal variances by considering one of the margins (in our example,
height or weight) as fixed in the bivariate normal model, thus conditioning
the model on the distribution of one of the two characteristics of the center
subpopulation.
  Specifically, model (1) gives rise to a regression model by conditioning
on either of the marginals. For example, by conditioning on X, we get the
following model


            Yi |xi ∼ N µY − ρσY /σX µX + ρσY /σX xi , σY2 (1 − ρ2 ) .
                                                                   

   Hogben 8 describes the variability of the sample correlation coefficient
of x and Y (denoted rxY ) in the simple linear regression model: Yi = α +
βxi + εi , i = 1, ...n with i.i.d. normal errors with mean 0 and variance
                                                      p
σ 2 . In that simple setting, the random quantity t = (n − 2)r2 /(1 − r2 )
is distributed as a noncentral t variable with noncentrality parameter
           pP
θ = β/σ          (xi − x̄)2 and (n − 2) degrees of freedom. Note that the
random variability applies to Yi , while the xi ’s, and, consequently θ are
fixed.
  Applying this result to our setting implies that txY =
           p
                     2         2
sign(rxY ) (n − 2)rxY  /(1 − rxY ) is distributed according to a noncentral
t-distribution with noncentrality parameter θ = √ρ 2
                                                            pP
                                                                  (xi − x̄)2
                                                                        σX    1−ρ
and (n − 2) degrees of freedom.
  In the practical implementation of the fixed margin approach we
introduce a random effect, i.e., a normal model for the center specific

distribution. A (two-sided) p-value per center is obtained by numerical
integration.
   The fixed margin approach, by construction, comes in two variants,
depending on which of the variables plays the role of the independent
(fixed) variable. If we denote the associated p-values pxY (fixing X)
and pyX (fixing Y ), respectively, we can introduce two variants, based
on taking the minimum or the maximum of these p-values: pmax =
max(pxY , pyX ) and pmin = min(pxY , pyX ). Obviously, the former will be
the more conservative and the latter the more liberal choice.


4      Simulation study

4.1      Simulation setup

Simulations are carried out according to the hybrid model introduced in
Section 2. We generate data for N = N0 + N1 centers, where N0 centers
follow model (2) with parameter ρ0 (null correlation), while N1 centers
follow the same model with a different parameter ρ1 . The contamination
rate is φ = N1 /(N0 + N1 ).
  Data are generated according to model (1) with µX = µY = 0, σX =
σY = 1. The number of centers is kept fixed at N = 100. Simulation
scenarios are constructed by combining different values for the parameters
of interest: ρ0 , ρ1 , σρ , and φ. For the sake of generality, and to allow
analysis of potential size effects, center sizes are unbalanced. Indeed,
in each data generation step, all sizes nc are drawn at random from a
discrete size distribution corresponding to sizes observed in one of three
real clinical datasets (Figure 2, in these distributions the sizes smaller than
5 have been replaced by 5). Thus, parameters are chosen as in Table 1.

4.2       Method evaluation

All methods assign a p-value to each center. The center is flagged as an
outlying one when its assigned p-value is smaller than the 0.05 threshold.
The distribution of p-values should be reasonably uniform under the null
model.
  Performance is measured in terms of power and specificity across a
number nsim of replications of the cycle: multicenter data generation -
p-value computation (several methods) - binary detection decision per
center.
  More precisely, in each replication the number of true positive, true
negative, false positive, and false negative center detections are computed
for the multicenter table at hand and these numbers are summed across
replications giving rise to totals TP , TN , FP , and FN respectively.
Then power is then computed as TP /(TP + FN ) and the specificity as
TN /(FP + TN ).

   The precision of the power estimate can be assessed by using a binomial
model: an upper bound for the standard deviation of the power estimate
                                     p
is provided by the expression 1/(2 φncenter nsim ). For example, with
ncenter = 100, contamination rate φ = 0.02, and nsim = 100, the bound
is 0.035 (standard deviation scale).




4.3      Selected results and discussion

When assessing the performance and validity of different detection
procedures, we examine a number of properties: (i) power should be
positively correlated with the absolute difference between ρ1 and ρ0
(bearing in mind that, in addition to the individual values ρ0 and ρ1 , the
random effect standard deviation σρ , and center sizes also play a role), and
(ii) specificity should be close to or above 95% across all scenarios (in
line with the 5% threshold). Additionally, (iii) power should be high for
small contamination rates and decrease with increasing rate (at φ =40%,
say, one might argue that it can no longer be considered contamination).
Taking into account the unbalanced nature of center-specific sample sizes
in clinical trials, in addition, (iv) the correlation test should not be biased
by center size, i.e., the probability for a center to be detected as outlying
should not be influenced by its size.

   Figures 3 and 4 present performance curves for the Fisher scale and
fixed margin methods as a function of the alternative correlation ρ1 for a
fixed null correlation ρ0 and given standard deviation and distribution of
the center sizes. These figures confirm that properties (i) and (ii) are met
for both tests in these simulations for a small contamination rate, which is
the situation of greatest interest in practice.

Power curves start at 20% approximately while specificity curves are above 95% throughout.




  In Figure 5, the effect of absolute magnitude of the signal, defined as
|ρ1 − ρ0 |, on both power and specificity is represented in terms of the
median across different scenarios and different matching (ρ0 , ρ1 ) pairs for
the same |ρ1 − ρ0 | value. In spite of being a rough summarisation, the
effect of increasing |ρ1 − ρ0 | is clearly monotonic before the curves level
off close to 100%. There is little difference between the reported methods
in terms of power and their specificity is conservatively controlled.
  Figure 6 (for power) and Supplementary Figure S1 (for specificity)
depict the combined effect of contamination rate, sizes distribution, and
random effect size (σρ ) across all available (ρ0 , ρ1 ) hypotheses for the
Fisher scale method, the fixed margin method (fixing x) and its maximum
variant. For the power it is useful to make a distinction between two
contamination ranges, say 1% to 5% and 10% to 40%.
  Focusing on the low contamination range, the sample size effect is
quite strong, for a given σρ . For a given sample size, increasing σρ

Desmet, Venet et al.                                                                             15


a good level of power at these small contamination rates, with overall
performance decreasing slightly with an increasing contamination rate.
  In the higher contamination range, power decreases more sharply, but
not evenly across methods. For the Fisher scale method it decreases
rather uniformly towards 0, whereas for the fixed margin method we
see substantial power in some scenarios, even at 40% contamination rate
(mostly in cases where either ρ0 or ρ1 equals 0.99 or −0.99).
  In terms of the specificity all methods are conservative, i.e., their
specificity remains consistently above the 95% bound. In Supplementary
Figure S1, we can observe increasing specificity with increasing
contamination rate.
  In order to assess property (iv), we compared distributions of the sizes
of the detected and the undetected centers. As a consequence of the setup
of our experiment, centers with the alternative correlation should have the
same size distribution as the original size distribution, shown in Figure
2. The analysis led to the conclusion that all methods comply reasonably
well with the property, as shown in Supplementary Figure S2.
  In view of its robustness, the test based on pmax turns out to be the
best option among the fixed margin test variants, as taking the maximum
implies only a negligible loss of power with respect to the tests based on
pxY or pyX .
  In conclusion, in the reported simulations, both the Fisher scale and
Fixed margin methods exhibit sufficient power to detect small amounts
of contamination, while they conservatively control the type I error
probability.


5 Applications and clinical examples
In this section we apply the proposed tests to actual datasets. The Fisher
scale test and the maximum variant of the fixed margin test now become
our default tests. We will refer to them as the Fisher test and Fixed margin

Figure 7. Height-weight data overall (grey dots) and in teams MLW, PIT and WAS (black
dots).


   This dataset has a different size distribution than usually seen in clinical
trials, as teams are typically of size around 30 (ranging from 28 to 37) and
the setup is thus reasonably balanced without small or large ”centers”.
From the descriptive statistics (Table 2) we can conclude that the marginal
distributions are quite comparable across teams. In particular, standard
deviations vary from team to team by no more than a factor 2 and this
holds both for height and weight. There is more variability in terms of
observed team-specific correlations. Figure 7 contrasts the scatterplots
of the aggregated data (overall correlation is 0.5319) and three selected
teams with extreme correlations: MLW (0.2147), PIT (0.7198), and WAS

(0.7233). In MLW and WAS, the correlation is in fact driven by one
extreme observation. Indeed, WAS happens to include the tallest player
in Major League Baseball history, while data for the other player (118 kg
for 183 cm) is on the edge of the cloud, but still plausible. In PIT, the
correlation seems to be driven by a concentration of players in a fairly
linear configuration in the center of the cloud.
   The p-values for the two proposed tests are shown in Table 2 (which
also shows the Fixed margin variants with conditioning on X and Y ,
respectively). Both the Fisher and the Fixed margin test each point to
one detection (using the 0.05 significance level) among the 30 teams,
where the detections concern teams with an extreme correlation already
mentioned above. The distribution of p-values (not shown here) was
reasonably uniform, as expected under the null. Thus, the flagged teams
are probably false positives as we have no reason to believe that the data
are not genuine or inaccurate, provided of course that the hypothesized
data-model is valid for this example. Note that, moreover, reported p-
values are not corrected for multiple testing.

5.2 Detection of fabricated datasets
Akhtar-Danesh and Dehghan-Kooshkghazi 10 investigated how the
correlation structure differs between real and fabricated clinical datasets.
They considered two real bivariate datasets, and for each one they had 34
faculty members make up a dataset (with 40 ficticious patients) mimicking
the original correlation structure as closely as possible.

  It turns out that the investigators, in spite of detailed instructions and
knowledge of the original data, failed to reproduce the data structure. Of
interest to our research was the question whether these datasets could be
identified as fabricated by a correlation test.
  We considered the two cases given in Table 3, and designed a numerical
experiment. In particular, we constructed hybrid multicenter datasets, in

which 19 centers were simulated according to the bivariate normal with
parameters as in the table (to be considered as the null model) and one
center was taken from the list of fabricated centers (kindly supplied by the
authors of 10 ).
  This simulation was repeated 100 times for each of the 34 fabricated
datasets. Based on a detection threshold of 0.05, power to detect the
fabricated center and specificity were computed per hybrid dataset and
reported in Supplementary Figure S3 (averages across 100 replications).
  We concluded that the different correlation tests had comparable power.
They also detected the majority of the fabricated centers (in half of the

least 50% power). The centers with a correlation closest to that of the null
model were, as expected, the most difficult to detect.
  An investigation of the use of the Fixed margin test, combined with other
tests on continuous variables in a central statistical monitoring approach
on these data, is the subject of a separate manuscript 11 . Indeed, when
data are fabricated in one or a few centers, this may also be visible on
the univariate level in terms of discrepancies in the means or standard
deviations of the variables X or Y across centers. While the Fixed margin
test would have detected about half of the 34 fabricated datasets, use of all
the data features would have detected all of them 11 .

5.3      Clinical examples
We analyse a few datasets from existing clinical trials in different
therapeutic fields. Clinical datasets typically have a large number of
continuous variables, hence a huge number of pairs of variables to be
tested, in multiple centers of different sizes. In addition, contrary to
simulated data, real clinical data cannot be assumed to strictly follow an
underlying bivariate normal model. In particular, there may be some extent
of disparity in the center means or scales (i.e. standard deviations of the
X or Y variable).
  For ease of interpretation, we will consider two pairs of continuous
variables that are known to be positively correlated: diastolic and systolic
blood pressure, and the height-weight pair, which we revisit. These
variables are available in most clinical trials as part of the vital signs data
collected for each patient at each visit.
  The main question we try to answer is: which centers are flagged and
can this be interpreted in terms of the correlation structure, and ideally in
terms of underlying phenomena on the domain level.
  Secondly, we also investigate whether the different tests for outlying
correlation yield consistent results.

  To obtain insight into the correlation structure of this type of data, we
can try to rely on reference ranges reported in literature or obtained from
publicly available datasets. In spite of compelling biological reasons for
the considered pairs of variables to be positively associated, observed
correlation values are often lower than one might expect. In the height-
weight pair, the observed correlation is directly influenced by the
characteristics of the population. Islam et al. 13 report a correlation of 0.435
in a group of 354 male students and of 0.319 in a group of 285 female
students of the same age range (18 to 25). Among (very fit) professional
baseball players, a larger correlation was obtained: 0.532 across teams. In
the blood pressure pair, both quantities are affected not only by baseline
characteristics and underlying conditions of the patients, but also by
temporary conditions of stress, level of activity etc. However, observed
correlation tends to be higher than in the height-weight pair. Gavish et al. 9
report a correlation of 0.74 in a study with 140 patients (age 56 +/- 17
years, 45% men).
  We use example datasets from real clinical trials with characteristics as
given in Table 4 (only centers of size minimum 5 and non-zero variance
in both variables are included, after discarding incomplete cases).
   As expected, center size plays a major role. Figure 8 presents the
relationship between correlation and center size across centers for all four
trials. In trial B, that has many centers, the scatterplot reveals a funnel-
like pattern. This reflects the variability present in the Pearson correlation:
smaller centers have more variability (wide opening along the Y-axis),
larger centers less (defining a narrow tube pointing to the right).

Figure 8. The relationship between center sizes and correlation in the example datasets,
flagged centers are marked for the Fisher and the Fixed margin tests.




  In trial C with small centers we see more variability on the Y-axis, and
in trial A with larger centers we have less variability as seen on the Y-axis
(in these two cases only part of the funnel is observed).
  It is indeed across the edges of the funnel that centers are detected:
centers with a too high or too low correlation, taking into account their
size.

  In trial A, a large center (A39) is detected with both methods with

B, a center (B198) of size 19 is detected for both pairs of variables.
The pattern in the blood pressure pair, see Figure 9, is more linear and
elongated than the overall pattern (correlation of 0.953, pH = 0.01 and
pF = 0.0023). This is partly due to the fact that many points coincide
because of discretization (rounding) effects. In the height-weight pair for

the same center we see a pattern of negative association (correlation of
−0.345, pH = 0.026 and pF = 0.0093), possibly driven by only one point.
  In center C52, 5 diastolic-systolic observations collapse to 3 perfectly
aligned points, resulting in extreme correlations and p-values (pH =
4.910−13 and pF = 5.0610−13 ). This points to a general phenomenon:
extreme correlations are sometimes obtained from a combination of small
center sizes and overlapping datapoints due to discretisation (in this
example: to multiples of 10 mmHg).
  In summary, centers can be detected if their correlation is markedly
outlying in either the positive or the negative direction with respect to the
general tendency across centers and taking into account the center size. In
most cases the two tests yield the same conclusion.
  In rare cases however, they disagree. One such example is center B102
for the height-weight pair, which is detected with the Fixed margin test
(size 146, correlation of 0.4221, pH = 0.040), but not with the Fisher test
(pF = 0.163).


6 Discussion

In this manuscript we have presented two methods for detection of
outlying correlations in a multicenter clinical trial. The methods have a
different rationale with somewhat different modelling assumptions, but
both rely on random effects.
  Random effects are essential in both methods and allow to account for
heterogeneity in centers above and beyond the variability already seen in
the estimates of the Pearson correlation. Without these random effects, this
heterogeneity could easily be mistaken for a signal and cause additional
false positive detections. In the basketball example, the random effect
above and beyond the Fisher variability based on center size is very small.
Without this additional component, the p-values in the Fisher scale test
become only slightly more significant.

  While the modelling assumptions at the basis of the Fisher test,
discussed in Section 2, allow for center specific standard deviations in
both variables, the underlying modeling assumptions for the Fixed margin
test imply that the centers should, at least approximately, have the same
scale for this method to be applicable. This is an important point when
evaluating both methods. In the simulation setup, standard deviations were
kept constant across trials while in real data sets it may not be the case.
  It should be stressed that real life data often have a more complex
structure than accounted for in our simple models, based on (1), even with
center-specific parameters. For example, the correlation coefficients rX,Y
and marginal standard deviations sX or sY might be correlated in their
own right (this was actually the case in the baseball players data set, with
a significant correlation of 0.4874 between σ̂weight and rheight,weight ). It is
therefore important to realize that the behaviour and performance of these
tests depends on the adequacy of the model assumptions to the data at
hand, leading, e.g., to different conclusions from the tests in a few cases.
In addition, real data may exhibit outliers, discretisation phenomena,
deviation from normality, coexistence of different units of measurement
across centers etc. These may all point to data quality issues, to be handled
manually up front, or to be considered in a broader perspective of CSM.
  The applications on fabricated and clinical data sets confronted us with
the fact that outlyingness in terms of the correlation, more often than
not is accompanied by outlyingness in terms of univariate features of the
data, e.g. in the means or standard deviations. This also brings us to the
concept of CSM, the process in which the correlation tests are typically
embedded. The aim of CSM is to combine different statistical tests
addressing different types of inconsistencies to flag problematic centers in
an unsupervised fashion. Each test assigns a p-value to individual centers,
resulting in a huge matrix of p-values. These p-values in turn provide
the basis for the computation of a summarizing score across tests and

across multiple variables 1 . In that sense, properties of the p-values of
individual tests are important. It is also in the scoring stage that tests may
be discarded, for instance if a too large percentage of the centers turns out
to be flagged, and this property allows to deal with the issue of excessive
power at large contamination rates mentioned before.

  In summary, we have presented two proposals for a correlation test with
demonstrated potential for application in a CSM workflow, as well as
in standalone applications. Our simulations indicated largely equivalent
performance of both tests.

Figure S2. The three panels correspond to the sizes distribution used in the simulation study
(left: Small, middle: Medium, right: Large). Within each panel, violin plots compare the sizes
of all detected centers (middle: fixed margin method (max), right: Fisher method) with the
baseline size distribution (left).
