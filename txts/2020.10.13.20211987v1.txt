    Abstract

    With polygenic risk score (PRS) for autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D), this study identified
    T1D cases with low T1D PRS and searched for susceptibility loci in these cases. Our hypothesis
    is that genetic effects (likely mediated by relatively rare genetic variants) of non-mainstream (or
    non-autoimmune) T1D might have been diluted in the previous studies on T1D cases in general.
    Two cohorts for the PRS modeling and testing respectively were included. The first cohort
    consisted of 3,356 T1D cases and 6,203 controls, and the independent second cohort consisted of
    3,355 T1D cases and 6,203 controls. Cases with low T1D PRS were identified using PRSice-2
    and compared to controls with low T1D PRS by genome-wide association (GWA) test. Twenty-
    six genetic loci with SNPs/SNVs associated with low PRS T1D at genome-wide significance
    (P≤5.0xE-08) were identified, including 4 established T1D loci, as well as 22 novel loci
    represented by rare SNVs. For the 22 novel loci, 12 regions have been reported of association
    with obesity related traits by previous GWA studies. Five loci encoding long intergenic non-
    protein coding RNAs (lncRNA), two loci involved in N-linked glycosylation, two loci encoding
    GTPase activators, and two ciliopathy genes, are also highlighted in this study.

    Introduction

    Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by T-cell mediated autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-
    cells(1). There is no cure for T1D to date. The molecular mechanisms underlying T1D are
    complex and not completely understood. Human genetic studies have uncovered multiple T1D
    genes that contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis ofT1D(2-7). With the rapid
    advances in human genomics technology in recent years, over 70 T1D loci have been
    identified(8) (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/). While these discoveries of T1D-associated genes
    have greatly increased our knowledge of T1D, our current genetic knowledge on T1D is far from
    complete, and a large number of T1D genes remain uncovered(9). A key bottleneck for the
    GWAS approach is limitation of sample size even with the presense of collaborative international
    consortia(10). The phenotype of type 1 diabetes has been regarded as heterogeneous. While the
    majority of T1D patients have autoimmune disease, 5–10% of Caucasian diabetic subjects with
    recent-onset T1D do not have islet cell antibodies, often referred to as T1bD(11). Due to different
    pathogenesis, T1bD cases may be associated with different genetic loci from autoimmune T1D,
    or T1aD. However, the smaller proportion of T1bD cases suggests that T1bD-related genetic
    effects have been diluted in the previous studies with T1D cases studied in general. Besides
    T1bD, the non-autoimmune and monogenic form of pediatric diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes
    of the young (MODY) cases, may be misdiagnosed as T1D(12), which further contributes to the
    heterogeneity of the T1D phenotype.

        With numerous genetic loci for many human complex diseases identified to date, polygenic
    risk scores (PRS) aggregate the effects of many genetic variants across the human genome into a
    single score, an approach that has been shown of improve disease prediction and differential
    diagnosis(13). The T1D loci identified by the GWAS studies to date are mainly associated with
    the genetic susceptibility of the major component of the heterogeneous T1D phenotype, i.e.
    T1aD, while the genetic susceptibility of the minor non-autoimmune components (e.g. T1bD and
    misdiagnosed MODY) are undere-represented in those results likely as a result of being diluted
    In this study, we propose that a high T1D PRS score predicts or suggests a T1aD case, whereas a
    low T1D PRS score in a T1D case suggests the opposite and represents our major interest in this
    study. Our aim in this study is to identify low PRS T1D cases and to run a seprate GWAS in an
    attempt to uncover genetic loci associated with T1bD patients.

    Methods

    Subjects: 6,711 European T1D cases and 12,406 European controls were included in this study.
    The T1D cases were from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)(14), The Diabetes
    Control and Complications Trial – Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications
    (DCCT-EDIC)                   cohort              (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-
    bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000086.v2.p1 ), the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC,
    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000180.v1.p1 ), and
    later recruited subjects at CHOP, respectively. The genotyping was done by the Illumina Human
    Hap550 Genotyping BeadChip or a newer version of Illumina Genotyping BeadChip. Other
    demographic, phenotypic and genotypic details about these individuals were described in our
    previous publication(15). Imputation of 39,131,579 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) on
    auto-chromosomes         was     done      using      the    Sanger     Imputation       Service
    (https://www.sanger.ac.uk/tool/sanger-imputation-service/) based on the Haplotype Reference

    Consortium (HRC) r1.1 reference panel (HRC.r1-1.GRCh37.wgs.mac5.sites.tab), with the
    quality filters of R2 ≥ 0.4. Altogether, 32,251,301 autosomal single nucleotide variants (SNV)
    with quality R2 ≥ 0.4 were included in this study. Population stratification was assessed by
    principal component analysis (PCA), and genetic association tests were corrected by the first 10
    principal components (PC). The association test was done using PLINK1.9 software(16).

    Polygenic risk scores (PRS): To avoid the issue of overfitting for PRS scoring, the subjects were
    randomly splitted into two independent cohorts without duplication, i.e. the PRS training cohort
    including 3,356 T1D cases and 6,203 controls, and the PRS testing cohort including 3,355 T1D
    cases and 6,203 controls. PRSs of the test cohort were calculated using the Polygenic Risk Score
    software (PRSice-2)(17), based on the statistics of the training group. The performance of a
    series of cutoff of T1D association P-values (including 10-10, 10-9 , 10-8, 10-7, 10-6, 10-5, 10-4,
    0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 1) for selection of SNP markers was assessed by the Area Under
    the ROC Curve (AUC). The P-value cutoff with the largest AUC was adopted.

    GWAS of T1D patients with low PRS: According to the PRS values, the T1D patients were
    separated into two groups, i.e. a low PRS group and a high PRS group. The PRS cutoff was
    determined by the maximum Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Using the same PRS
    cutoff, health controls with low T1D PRS were identified. The GWAS of T1D patients with low
    PRS was performed by comparing to health controls with low T1D PRS. The Manhattan plots
    were done using the web-based FUMA platform(18). Genetic association signals within each
    locus were plotted by LocusZoom(19).

    Data and Resource Availability: The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current
    study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

    Results

    AUC of different cutoffs of T1D association P-values for SNP selection and PRS

    The AUCs of different cutoffs of T1D association P-values for selection of SNP sets are shown
    in Table 1a. The best AUC (0.8607) is seen at the cutoff of P-value≤1E-05, which suggests that
    stricter cutoff may cause the missing of informative SNPs, while looser may introduce noise by
    including SNPs with spurious T1D association. Based on the SNP markers with T1D association
    P-value≤1E-05, a PRS score was acquired for each individual in the independent test cohort. By
    the maximum MCC (Supplementary Table 1), a PRS cutoff of 1.11E-03 has the maximum MCC
    (0.6294). A PRS≤1.11E-03 was defined as low risk, and a PRS>1.11E-03 was defined as high
    risk. With this threshold, the sensitivity (True positive rate, TPR) for T1D prediction is 75.9%,
    and the specificity (True negative rate, TFR) for T1D prediction is 86.4%. By PRS≤1.11E-03,
    810 (24.1%, including 408 males, 400 females, and 2 cases with undetermined sex) out of 3,355
    T1D cases had low PRS; and 5,358 (86.4%, including 2,893 males, 2,453 females, and 12 cases
    with undetermined sex) out of 6,203 controls had low PRS.

    GWAS of T1D patients with low PRS

    The GWAS of T1D patients with low T1D PRS compared to controls with low T1D PRS
    identified a large number of SNPs associated with T1D with genome-wide significance
    (P≤5.0xE-08), from 7 genetic loci (Supplementary Table 2, Figure 1). Among these 7 genetic loci,

    3 loci have been established of T1D association by previous studies, including HLA, INS, and
    PTPN22 (Table 2a). By looking at the established leading T1D signal of each locus, the
    frequencies of the predisposing alleles of HLA and PTPN22 were lower in the low T1D PRS
    cohort, while the protective allele of INS were higher in the low T1D PRS cohort. The effect
    sizes of HLA (P=2.72E-06) and PTPN22 (P=0.047) were significantly smaller in the low PRS
    cases. Besides these 3 established T1D loci, 4 novel loci associated with low PRS T1D were
    identified (Table 3a). LocusZoom plots for genetic association signals within each locus are
    shown in Supplementary Figure 1-4. The association signals of these loci are only seen in low
    PRS T1D cases, but not in the T1D cases overall, and were missed previously due to diluted
    genetic effects.

    Replication of the PRS model and additional novel loci

    Consequently, we switched the two cohorts, i.e. using the second cohort for the statistics of PRS
    modelling, then we tested the PRS models in the first cohort. The AUCs of different cutoffs of T1D
    association P-values for selection of SNP sets are shown in Table 1b. The best AUC (0.8654) is
    seen at the cutoff of P-value≤1E-05, which repeated the PRS model in the above step. Based on
    the SNP markers with T1D association P-value≤1E-05, a PRS score was acquired for each
    individual in the independent test cohort. By the maximum MCC (Supplementary Table 3), a
    PRS cutoff of 1.24E-03 has the maximum MCC (0.6294). A PRS≤7.18E-04 was defined as low
    risk, and a PRS>7.18E-04 was defined as high risk. With this threshold, the sensitivity (True
    positive rate, TPR) for T1D prediction is 66.0%, and the specificity (True negative rate, TFR) for
    T1D prediction is 93.6%. By PRS≤7.18E-04, 918 (27.4%, including 437 males, 479 females, and
    2 cases with undetermined sex) out of 3,356 T1D cases had low PRS; and 5,585 (90.0%,
    including 3,008 males, 2,565 females, and 12 cases with undetermined sex) out of 6,203
    controls had low PRS.

        As expected from the above results, in the switched cohort, the GWAS of T1D patients with
    low T1D PRS compared to controls with low T1D PRS identified a large number of SNPs
    associated with T1D with genome-wide significance (P≤5.0xE-08) as well (Supplementary Table
    4, Figure 2). Among these loci, 4 loci have been established of T1D association by previous
    studies, including HLA, INS, PTPN22, and the IKZF4/RPS26/ERBB3 locus (Table 2b).
    Consistent to the first GWAS results listed above, by looking at the established leading T1D
    signal of each locus, the frequencies of the predisposing alleles of HLA, PTPN22 and IKZF4
    were lower in the low T1D PRS cohort, while the protective allele of INS were higher in the low
    T1D PRS cohort. The effect size of the leading HLA SNP was significantly smaller in the low
    PRS cases (P=1.05E-11). Besides these established T1D loci, 18 novel loci associated with low
    PRS T1D were identified in this cohort (Table 3b). LocusZoom plots for genetic association
    signals within each locus are shown in Supplementary Figure 5-22.

    Discussion

    Altogether, rare variants (MAF<5%) from 22 novel loci were identified in the low PRS T1D
    cases with genome-wide significance (P<5.00E-08), in addition to the 4 established T1D loci
    with smaller genetic effects in these cases. The association signals of these loci are only seen in
    low PRS T1D cases, but not in the T1D cases overall, and were missed previously due to rare
    allele frequencies and diluted genetic effects in the general T1D cohort. Among the 22 loci, two

    genetic regions have been reported of association with diabetes, i.e. the region containing the
    DLL1/ FAM120B locus associated with type 1 diabetes in Caucasian by our previous study(20),
    and the region containing the TICRR locus associated Type 2 diabetes in African population(21).
    In addition, a number of genetic associations with body mass index (BMI), obesity, and
    autoimmunity, have been reported in the flanking regions of 300kb on each side of the new loci
    according to the GWAS Catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/, Supplementary materials).
    Further details on these 22 loci are described below.

    LINC01865/LINC01874 tagged by rs186500234

    The long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1865 gene (LINC01865) has low expression
    observed in testis, brain, and duodenum. The long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1874 gene
    (LINC01874) has restricted expression toward kidney(22). This genetic region has been reported
    of association with body mass index (BMI) by previous study(23).

    LOC730100 tagged by rs28957087

    LOC730100 encodes a long non-coding RNA (ncRNA), a competing endogenous RNA for
    human microRNA 760 (miR-760)(24). The latter inhibits the expression of the Forkhead Box A1
    gene (FOXA1). As a hepatocyte nuclear factor, FOXA1, also known as HNF3A or TCF3A,
    regulates tissue-specific gene expression in liver and many other tissues(25). FoxA1 is essential
    for normal pancreatic and ß-cell function and a negative regulator of the hepatocyte nuclear
    factor-1 (HNF1) homeobox A gene (HNF1A) and the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, alpha gene
    (HNF4A)(26) (27). HNF1A and HNF4A are established genes causing maturity-onset diabetes of
    the young (MODY). The FOXA1 mutation Ser448Asn has been suggested of association with
    impaired glucose homeostasis(27).

    B3GNT2/TMEM17 tagged by rs75634056

    The UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 gene (B3GNT2) encodes
    an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains. The gene plays an
    important role in immunological biofunctions, and its deficiency causes hyperactivation of
    lymphocytes in mice(28). The transmembrane protein 17 gene (TMEM17) encodes a critical
    component of a protein complex at the base of cilia. Previous GWAS studies have reported
    association with Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and hypothyroidism in this genetic
    region.

    FAM136A/TGFA tagged by rs77418738

    The family with sequence similarity 136 member A gene (FAM136A) encodes a mitochondrially
    localized protein. The transforming growth factor alpha gene (TGFA) mediates cell-cell adhesion
    and activates cell proliferation, differentiation and development. This region has been reported of
    association with obesity-related traits(29).

    GCC2/EDAR tagged by rs922452

    The GRIP and coiled-coil domain containing 2 (GCC2) encodes a long coiled-coil protein, also
    known as GCC185, which is localized to the trans-Golgi network with critical function in

    maintaining Golgi structure and tethering transport vesicle(30). The ectodysplasin A receptor
    gene (EDAR) encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family with a key role in
    ectodermal differentiation. Association with low birth weight at this region has been reported(31).

    SEL1L3 tagged by rs6842426

    The locus SEL1L family member 3 gene (SEL1L3) is a paralog of the SEL1L adaptor subunit of
    ERAD E3 ubiquitin ligase gene (SEL1L). The latter is highly expressed in pancreas and thyroid,
    and is crucial for misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum being discharged into the
    cytosol and degraded by the proteasome(32). This gene region has been reported association with
    obesity-related traits(29) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease(33).

    TBC1D1/LINC01258 tagged by rs4833044

    This genetic locus contains two genes, the TBC1 domain family member 1 gene (TBC1D1) and
    the long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1258 gene (LINC01258). A common variant it this
    locus has been reported to be associated with childhood obesity(29; 34), triacylglycerol 54:5
    levels(35), lymphocyte percentage of leukocytes(36) by previous studies. Acting as a GTPase
    activator, the TBC1D1 protein plays a role in regulating cell growth and differentiation. Rare
    mutations in TBC1D1 have been reported to be associated with congenital anomalies of the
    kidney and urinary tract.

    LINC02432/IL15 tagged by rs9790756

    The long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 2432 gene (LINC02432) has higher expression in
    kidney and pancreas. Interleukin 15 (IL-15) encoded by the gene IL15 is essential for regulating
    activation and proliferation of T and natural killer cells, and supporting lymphoid homeostasis.
    IL-15 and interleukine 2 (IL-2) share many biological activities and receptor components with
    IL-2. IL-2 is a powerful growth factor for both T and B lymphocytes. Both IL2 and the α chain
    of the IL2 receptor complex gene (IL2RA) has been established of genetic association with T1D
    by previous studies(37-39).

    DEK/RNF144B tagged by rs16880565

    The DEK proto-oncogene gene (DEK) encodes a site-specific DNA binding protein and a
    component of the pre-mRNA splicing complex, and is involved in transcriptional regulation and
    pre-mRNA splicing. DEK encoded protein is also an autoantigen in patients with pauciarticular
    onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The ring finger protein 144B gene (RNF144B) encoded
    protein inhibits LPS-induced inflammatory responses by binding with TANK binding kinase 1
    (TBK1) and causing interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) dephosphorylation and interferon β
    (IFN-β) reduction. This region has been reported of association with BMI by previous studies(23;
    40).

    RGS17 tagged by rs80292134

    The regulator of G protein signaling 17 gene (RGS17) encodes a member of the regulator of G-
    protein signaling family. This genetic region has been established association with BMI by
    previous studies(23; 40).

    DLL1/FAM120B tagged by rs3800237

    The delta like canonical Notch ligand 1 (DLL1) encodes a Notch ligand with a role in cell-fate
    decision processes in lymphopoiesis. This Notch ligand can completely inhibit the differentiation
    of human hematopoietic progenitors into the B cell lineage while promoting the generation of T
    cell/natural killer (NK) precursors(41). The family with sequence similarity 120B gene
    (FAM120B) encodes a constitutive coactivator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ
    (PPARγ, a major therapeutic target for insulin sensitivity) and promotes adipogenesis(42). The
    region containing the DLL1/ FAM120B genes has been reported of association with T1D in
    Caucasian by our previous study(20).

    NME8/GPR141 tagged by rs12532321

    The NME/NM23 family member 8 gene (NME8) encodes an axoneme protein, and its mutation
    may cause primary ciliary dyskinesia. The G protein-coupled receptor 141 gene (GPR141) at the
    upstream of NME8 is highly expressed in bone marrow. This genetic region has been reported of
    association with obesity-related traits in Hispanic children(29).

    CALN1 tagged by rs118182411

    The calneuron 1 gene (CALN1), encoding a protein with high similarity to the calcium-binding
    proteins of calmodulin, is highly expressed in brain and adrenal. This genetic region has
    established association with BMI by previous studies(23; 40).

    ZNF804B tagged by rs77205087

    The zinc finger protein 804B gene (ZNF804B) has been reported of association with N-linked
    glycosylation of human immunoglobulin G (IgG), which modulates its binding to Fc
    receptors(43). N-glycosylation of cytokines and proteases is also a regulatory mechanism in
    inflammation and autoimmunity(44). Changes in N-glycosylation have been associated with
    different autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis(45), type 1 diabetes(46), Crohn's
    disease(47).

    NFIB tagged by rs10961435

    The nuclear factor I B gene (NFIB) encodes a transcription factor in the FOXA1 transcription
    factor network. NFIB has been shown to play critical roles in lung and brain development. A
    previous study has shown that NFIB can bind with FoxA1 and modulate the transcriptional
    activity of FoxA1(48), while the later has been suggested to play a role in pancreatic and ß-cell
    function and non-autoimmune diabetes as discussed above.

    TBC1D2/GABBR2 tagged by rs11559334

    This genetic locus contains two protein-coding genes, the TBC1 domain family member 2 gene
    (TBC1D2) and the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 2 gene (GABBR2,
    encoding a member of the G-protein coupled receptor 3 family). As discussed above, this study
    identified an association signal in the TBC1D1 region, and the TBC1D1 locus has been reported
    of association with childhood obesity(29; 34).

    LINC00841/C10orf142 tagged by rs746298

    The two genes at this locus, LINC00841/C10orf142, encode two long intergenic non-protein
    coding RNAs (lincRNA). While the function of these two genes remain unknown, this locus has
    been reported of association with obesity-related traits(29).

    SYT10/ALG10 tagged by rs10506114

    The synaptotagmin 10 gene (SYT10) encodes a membrane protein of secretory vesicles
    expressed in pancreas, lung and kidney(49). The ALG10 alpha-1,2-glucosyltransferase gene
    (ALG10) encodes a membrane-associated protein that adds the third glucose residue to the lipid-
    linked oligosaccharide precursor for N-glycosylation in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)(50). As
    discussed above in the ZNF804B locus, N-glycosylation of IgG, cytokines and proteases is also a
    regulatory mechanism in inflammation and autoimmunity(43; 44) associated with different
    autoimmune diseases. This region has established association with waist-hip ratio by previous
    study(40).

    CHST11 tagged by rs75438334

    The carbohydrate sulfotransferase 11 gene (CHST11) encodes a member of the sulfotransferase 2
    family catalyzing chondroitin sulfate synthesis. This genetic region has been reported of
    association with waist circumference adjusted for body mass index by previous study(51).

    CHFR/LOC101928530/ZNF605 tagged by rs12230138

    The checkpoint with forkhead and ring finger domains gene (CHFR) encodes an E3 ubiquitin-
    protein ligase and is involved in the DNA damage response and checkpoint regulation. The
    structure and function of the gene LOC101928530 is still uncharacterized. The function of the
    zinc finger protein 605 gene (ZNF605) may be related to Herpes Simplex Virus 1 infection
    (https://pathcards.genecards.org/card/herpes_simplex_virus_1_infection). This region has been
    reported of association with BMI by previous study(52).

    TICRR/ KIF7 tagged by rs2197053

    The TOPBP1 interacting checkpoint and replication regulator gene (TICRR) encodes Treslin,
    which is involved in triggering the initiation of DNA replication. The kinesin family member 7
    gene (KIF7) in this region encodes a cilia-associated protein of the kinesin family, with its
    mutations causing ciliopathies. The region containing the TICRR gene has been reported of
    association with T2D in African population(21), BMI(23; 52), and obesity-related traits(29) by
    previous studies.

    LINC01695/LINC00161 tagged by rs7278151

    Function of the long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1695 gene (LINC01695) is still
    uncharacterized. The long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 161 gene (LINC00161) encodes a
    functional RNA that regulates Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) expression. The
    MAPK1/STAT3 pathway has been proposed as a novel diabetes target for its critical role in
    glucose homeostasis(53).

        In summary, in the genetic regions containing the 22 novel loci disclosed by this study, more
    than half of these regions have been reported of association with obesity-related traits, BMI, or
    waist circumference. The correlation with obesity related traits or impaired glucose homeostasis
    is in keeping with non-autoimmune roles in the diabetes patients with low T1D PRS.
    Interestingly, genes related N-linked glycosylation, e.g. ZNF804B and ALG10, are highlighted in
    this study, which may suggest the role of N-glycosylation bridging impaired glucose homeostasis
    and autoimmune diabetes. N-glycosylation is commonly altered in diabetes(54). This particular
    locus supports an interesting hypothesis of T1D pathogenesis, i.e. the accelerator hypothesis,
    which implies that increasing obesity-associated insulin resistance accelerates the disease process
    of type 1 diabetes(55; 56). Insulin resistance-related mechanisms might thus be able to serve as
    potential novel therapeutic targets for these patients with low T1D PRS.

        In addition, 5 loci encoding long intergenic non-protein coding RNAs (lncRNA) identified in
    this study emphasize the importance of lncRNAs in these diabetes patients. This study identified
    2 loci containing TBC1D1 and TBC1D2 respectively, encoding two GTPase activators. TBC1D1
    has been suggested as a novel obesity gene by previous study(34). Two loci containing the
    TMEM17 and KIF7 genes corrected with ciliopathies suggest a role of primary cilia in
    diabetes(57). However, we admit that this study has limitations related to the bottleneck of
    sample size and data resources. The novel loci reported in this study still need replication in
    independent samples. In addition, the functional mechanisms of these genetic loci in diabetes
    warrant experimental investigation.
