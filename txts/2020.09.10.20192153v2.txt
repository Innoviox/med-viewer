    Modeling the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 immunity waning, antigenic
    drifting, and population serology patterns
    By James S. Koopman & Carl P. Simon: University of Michigan. October 7, 2020
    The authors have withdrawn this manuscript for the following reason. Upon following
    their strategy for making valid decisions, they found that making the escape from
    immunity steps in the model more biologically realistic, the model behavior changed so
    significantly that the first version of the model was no longer valid. Specifically, the old
    version misdirected drifting toward instead of away from immunity. The authors intend to
    upload a new version of their manuscript in the coming weeks. Therefore, the authors
    do not wish this work to be cited as reference for the project. If you have any questions,
    please contact the corresponding author.
