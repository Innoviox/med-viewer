57     ABSTRACT
58     Inhibitory neurons are critical for normal brain function but dysregulated in disorders
59     such as epilepsy. At least two theories exist for how inhibition may acutely decrease
60     during a seizure: hyperpolarization of fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons by other
61     inhibitory neurons, or depolarization block (DB) of FS neurons resulting in an inability to
62     fire action potentials. Firing rate alone is unable to disambiguate these alternatives.
63     Here, we show that human FS neurons can stop firing due to both hyperpolarization and
64     DB within the same seizure. However, only DB of FS cells is associated with dramatic
65     increases in local seizure amplitude, unobstructed traveling waves, and transient
66     increases in excitatory neuronal firing. This result is independent of seizure etiology or
67     focus. Computational models of DB reproduce the in vivo human biophysics. These
68     methods enable intracellular decoding using only extracellular recordings in humans
69     and explain the otherwise ambiguous inhibitory neuronal control of human seizures.

 88     INTRODUCTION
 89
 90     Epilepsy is a debilitating disease affecting some 50 million people worldwide1,2. Epileptic
 91     seizures are thought to result from an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory
 92     neuronal activity3. However, electrographically similar seizures on the macroscopic
 93     scale can be driven by mechanistically distinct processes on the cellular and cell-type
 94     population scale4. Thus, the relative roles of local inhibitory and excitatory networks in
 95     driving seizure progression must be elucidated to guide the development of novel
 96     treatments for intractable epilepsies and our understanding of their associated seizures.
 97     Due to the tremendous technical challenges of recording from individual human neurons
 98     and the relative sparsity of inhibitory neurons, the activity of well isolated inhibitory
 99     interneurons during seizures is only rarely examined5,6.
100
101     There are several theories, based on slice and whole animal experiments, proposing
102     both insufficient7–15 and excessive16–20 inhibition as possible facilitators of epileptic
103     activity, with at least two hypotheses for how inhibition may acutely decrease during a
104     seizure: (1) hyperpolarization of fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons by other inhibitory
105     neurons21–24, or (2) excessive depolarization of FS neurons that precludes subsequent
106     action potentials due to blockade of voltage-dependent sodium channels12,14,25,56.
107     Resolving these two theories necessitates whole cell recordings26, but it is practically
108     impossible to record the intracellular membrane potential of neurons during human
109     seizures in vivo. In this study, we address these challenges by combining (1) large-
110     scale extracellular recordings of human neocortical inhibitory and excitatory neurons
111     during focal seizures with secondary generalization and (2) a novel method of decoding
                                                                        Page 3

113     remarkable ability of active fast-spiking inhibitory neurons to block epileptic traveling
114     waves in human neocortex, and reveal the dynamical control of human seizures by the
115     subthreshold trajectory of inhibitory neurons.

118     RESULTS
119     Patients were implanted with intracranial grid electrodes as part of the clinical process
120     of identifying the precise site of origin of their drug-resistant focal epilepsy (see
121     Materials and Methods). A 4x4 mm NeuroPort microarray (Blackrock Microsystems)
122     was also placed in a region of the neocortex that was expected to be in the resection
123     site (Figure 1a; Extended Data Fig. 1a). Histology of the resected tissue confirmed that
124     the electrodes consistently targeted layers 2/3 of the neocortex (Extended Data Fig. 1b).
125     We used these arrays to simultaneously record the activity of dozens of individual
126     neocortical neurons during both ictal and interictal activity. We then classified the
127     neurons as either fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons or regular-spiking (RS)
128     excitatory cells using well-established criteria27,28, including action potential shape
129     (Extended Data Fig. 1c-f). FS cells correspond to the class of parvalbumin-expressing
130     interneurons and represent the largest source of inhibition in the neocortex29. The
131     resulting information thus allowed us to differentiate between putative inhibitory and
132     excitatory unit activity patterns during seizure progression in humans.
133
134     A total of 37 FS cells and 539 RS cells were recorded across 4 patients with NeuroPort
135     arrays implanted in the temporal neocortex (see Supplementary Methods for details
136     about each patient). As secondarily generalized seizures first reached the arrays, both
137     FS and RS cells increased their rate of action potentials (Figs. 1, 2, and Extended Data
138     Figs. 2-4). This finding is consistent with what is known about the feedforward
139     recruitment of both inhibition and excitation25,30. At the population level, the FS firing
140     rate was significantly higher than RS cells (100,000 bootstrap iterations of label-shuffled
                                                                        Page 5

141     peak rate differences; p=0.036). Within 40 seconds of seizure onset, the mean FS firing
142     rate fell rapidly to 0-2 Hz at the same time as local field potential intensity increased
143     dramatically to its highest levels (Figs. 1, 2, and Extended Data Figs. 2-4). Consistently,
144     among the best isolated FS units during the seizure (isolation quality discussed in more
145     detail below and see Methods), 10 out of 15 had at least one nearby RS cell that
146     exhibited the peak of its overall activity several seconds after the dramatic fall in local
147     FS activity and accompanying elevation in local field potential intensity (Figs. 1, 2, and
148     Extended Data Figs. 2-4). Thus, at the population level, FS cells show a cessation of
149     activity near the middle of secondarily generalized seizures accompanied by a dramatic
150     increase in the amplitude of seizure activity. This FS cessation is followed by a transient
151     increase in RS cell firing, presumably because these RS cells are now less inhibited
152     due to the loss of FS firing. The RS population rate eventually also fell to an average of
153     0-3 Hz but with a delay of several seconds following FS cells. At the population level,
154     FS cells (N=37) exhibited significantly earlier cessation times than RS cells (N=539)
155     (Fig. 2g-j, FS cell average cessation occurred 4.6 seconds earlier than RS average
156     cessation; 100,000 bootstrap iterations of label-shuffled time differences; p<0.0001).
157
158     We next compared activity patterns among individual FS cells. Many individual FS cells
159     did not start firing until ~10 seconds into the seizure, often starting to fire robustly only
160     after the RS rate had already increased (Figs. 1, 2, and Extended Data Figs. 2-4). As
161     seen with the population means (Fig. 2g), each individual FS cell dramatically reduced
162     its firing roughly half-way through the seizure (Figs. 1, 2, and Extended Data Figs. 2-4).
163     However, even simultaneously recorded FS cells during a single seizure did not
                                                                        Page 6

164     necessarily cease firing at the same time, just as they did not start firing at the same
165     time. Figure 1 shows the activity of two simultaneously recorded FS cells that were
166     separated by a distance of 2.04 mm. FS Cell 1 (Fig. 1a) approached cessation ~35
167     seconds into the seizure, and at ~35 seconds, the amplitude of the LFP next to FS Cell
168     1 increased dramatically, as did the firing rate of nearby RS cells. FS Cell 2 (Fig. 1b)
169     approached cessation ~24 seconds into the seizure, and the LFP amplitude next to FS
170     Cell 2 also increased at ~24 seconds, along with the firing rate of nearby RS cells.
171     Furthermore, when sorting all simultaneously recorded channels during a seizure by the
172     timing of transition to the large amplitude spike-and-wave event phase, a raster plot of
173     all spikes with units sorted in the same order produced a similar sequence of mid-
174     seizure firing time cessations (Fig. 1c&d). Thus, FS cell cessation is correlated with a
175     dramatic increase in the very local intensity of seizures.
176
177     Given changing waveform shapes and noise characteristics during seizures31, an
178     important methodological question arises of how separable clusters in waveform feature
179     space are from each other and from noise to allow valid unit assignments during this
180     period. To quantitatively assess this isolation quality of feature space clusters over the
181     course of seizures, we employed a modified version of the Lratio metric of cluster
182     separation introduced and validated by Schmitzer-Torbert et al. (2005)58 (see Methods).
183     Cluster divisions with Lratio less than 0.1 are considered to have a significantly low level
184     of false negative contamination, indicating that drops in firing rate are not caused by
185     over-assigning candidate spikes to noise or other clusters due to changing waveform
186     shapes in these divisions. We consider units whose average contamination level across
                                                                        Page 7

187     seizure divisions (dynamic Lratio) is less than 0.1 to be a best-isolated subset58. Figure 2
188     shows an example of an FS unit whose waveform shape could be well isolated from
189     noise across the entire seizure despite showing a monotonic decrease in spike
190     amplitude (Fig. 2a-c). The isolation quality of this unit throughout the seizure is
191     demonstrated visually by 2D voltage histograms of these waveforms (Fig. 2d) and is
192     quantitatively captured by its dynamic Lratio being far below threshold in all seizure
193     divisions in which it was active (Fig. 2b). This isolation quality was similarly sustainable
194     throughout the seizure for many RS units (e.g. Extended Data Fig. 5), although at a
195     lower proportion than FS units, with 48.6% of FS units meeting this criterion but only
196     19.8% of RS units. This pattern sustained throughout seizures, with the proportion of
197     well-isolated FS units remaining between 30% and 48% across all 8 seizure divisions
198     and that of RS units remaining between 13% and 19% (Extended Data Fig. 6). The
199     apparent difference in sortability by cell type may be because the frequency content of
200     noise is such that random threshold crossings are more similar in shape and amplitude
201     to the wider waveforms of RS units than to the sharper waveforms of FS units. This
202     suggests that FS cell spikes are inherently more distinguishable from noise in human
203     neocortical recordings even during seizures. We considered the best-isolated subset of
204     units following this quantitative criterion in parallel with all-inclusive analyses of firing
205     rate dynamics in various time divisions of seizures with similar results. In particular,
206     similar temporal profiles by cell type were observed throughout seizures when
207     considering all units or only best-sorted units with an average Lratio < 0.1 across all
208     divisions for Patient C (Fig. 2e&f), as well as when comparing average firing rate time
209     courses by cell type across all patients (Fig. 2g&h). Furthermore, the observed time
                                                                        Page 8

210     difference between mean RS activity cessation timing and mean FS activity cessation
211     timing remained significantly larger than that expected by random cell-type label
212     reshuffling when considering all units (p<0.0001; Fig. 2i), as well as only best-isolated
213     units with maximum Lratio < 0.1 (p<0.005; Fig. 2j). Thus, FS cell cessation occurs several
214     seconds before RS cell cessation across the population as well as for the very best
215     isolated units.
216
217     The firing profile of individual FS cells and the accompanying changes in the seizure
218     LFP amplitude were remarkably consistent across all secondary generalized focal
219     seizures examined, independent of etiology or focus (Figs. 1, 2, and Extended Data
220     Figs. 2-4). In patients with an etiology of mesial temporal sclerosis, where the seizure
221     started focally in the hippocampus or surrounding medial temporal regions, FS cells in
222     the temporal neocortex consistently stopped firing after the seizure secondarily
223     generalized and spread to the neocortex, leading to accompanying increases in seizure
224     LFP amplitude (Fig. 1a&b). Similarly, in a patient with an etiology of neocortical
225     dysplasia (Patient C) where the seizure originated in the temporal neocortex, several
226     cm from the implanted electrode array, FS cells near the array stopped firing within the
227     first 40 seconds of the seizure spreading to that location (Fig. 2a&b). Again, this
228     coincided with a transition to even larger amplitude spike-wave LFP events.
229
230     The variability in FS cessation times raises the question of how seizure waves travel
231     across the neocortex: is there a wave that slowly moves across the cortex32 or a series
232     of faster waves that are perhaps altered by the local activity of FS cells11,30,33? We found
                                                                        Page 9

233     fast traveling LFP waves in all patients that swept across the 4x4 mm microelectrode
234     array within 40 ms, at a speed of ~0.1 m/s, consistent with estimates from slice and
235     computational studies30,34–36. There was a dramatic effect of individual FS cell activity:
236     when an FS cell was still firing, it was able to impede and alter epileptic traveling waves
237     (Fig. 3a), preventing the wave from increasing the seizure’s LFP amplitude in the vicinity
238     of the FS cell. Once the FS cell activity ceased, traveling waves swept through the
239     entire array, successfully recruiting the area around the now-silent FS cell (Figure 3B).
240     Indeed, once all FS cells had switched off, the path of epileptic traveling waves became
241     far more regular and stereotyped. Thus, human FS inhibitory cells possess a
242     remarkable capability to obstruct and alter the path of epileptic traveling waves. This
243     again points to the importance of FS activity in controlling local neuronal activity and
244     LFP dynamics during local seizure propagation but leaves open the question of what is
245     causing them to stop firing during the seizure.
246
247     There are two ways in which FS cells can stop firing during a seizure: 1) they could be
248     hyperpolarized by inhibition from other inhibitory neurons22, also known as the
249     disinhibition hypothesis23; or 2) they could enter depolarization block and thus become
250     incapable of firing additional action potentials, despite receiving strong excitatory
251     synaptic input12,14,25,56. These two scenarios produce very different predictions for how
252     the action potential (AP) amplitude of an FS cell should change during a seizure. In the
253     case of hyperpolarization, the AP amplitude should increase as the firing rate is
254     decreasing. In the case of depolarization block, AP amplitude should decrease before
255     the cell stops firing while its firing rate is also decreasing. To monitor the relative

256     contributions of hyperpolarization and excessive depolarization throughout the seizure
257     in each recorded unit, we therefore devised a novel method that decodes the
258     membrane potential regime of neurons from extracellular spike amplitude data by
259     computing the sign of the correlation between AP amplitude and firing rate in each
260     second of the seizure (Fig. 4a-c; see Methods). Some units first paused their firing due
261     to transient inhibition from other cells, as suggested by strongly negative correlations
262     between AP amplitude and firing rate as firing rate initially decreased (Fig. 4b&h;
263     Extended Data Figs. 7&8). This period corresponded precisely to the time period of
264     increased firing in neighboring FS units (Fig. 4d&j). However, these apparently
265     hyperpolarized units resumed their firing after this pause. Cessation of firing
266     subsequently occurred presumably due to massive depolarization of their membrane
267     potential, as demonstrated by strongly positive correlations of AP amplitude and firing
268     rate as these units stopped firing spikes (Fig. 4b&h). The regimes of negative
269     correlation correspond to a dynamic inhibitory control of local firing rates during the
270     seizure, followed by a regime of positive correlation with decreasing AP amplitudes
271     during the final descent in firing rate, a pattern consistent with what is seen during
272     depolarization block.
273
274     This pattern was also seen on the population level in spiking event-triggered averages
275     of the time course of our predicted membrane potential measure (Fig. 4e). Aligning
276     inferred membrane potential time courses around the time of firing rate pauses
277     (dropping below 30% of peak rate) revealed a large negative deflection for FS cells,
278     indicative of these units being inhibited via hyperpolarization to reduce firing rate at this
                                                                        Page 11

280     mean resampling test, nsample=10, Nbootstrap=50,000). Furthermore, the inferred
281     membrane potential amongst the FS cell population showed that this shift was also
282     widespread (Fig. 4f), with 9 out of 12 (75%) FS units pausing during the negative,
283     hyperpolarized regime during this rate-based event. Aligning inferred membrane
284     potential time courses around the later time of firing rate cessation in units (defined by
285     rate falling below 30% of peak rate for the final time) revealed a large positive deflection
286     for FS cells, indicative of these units entering a regime depolarization block (Fig. 4e;
287     n=26; Rmean,cess=+0.45±0.12 [sem]; greater than 0 with p<10-7 by bootstrap mean
288     resampling test, nsample=20, Nbootstrap=50,000). Again, the inferred membrane potential
289     amongst the FS cell population showed that this shift was also widespread across units
290     (Fig. 4f), with 20 out of 26 (77%) FS units landing in the positive, over-excited regime.
291     When comparing these values only in units that showed both a pause and cessation to
292     control of heterogeneity amongst different units, the inferred membrane potential was
293     still significantly higher as the unit ceased firing compared to as the unit paused its firing
294     (right-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test; n=12, p=0.0049). Finally, these firing rate
295     descents in FS cell activity were associated with distinct changes in LFP amplitude
296     despite being of the same magnitude (at 30% of peak firing rate) as shown by event-
297     triggered averages in LFP amplitude (Fig. 4e). FS cessation was associated with a
298     larger LFP amplitude than that associated with pausing even amongst cells exhibiting
299     both events (right-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test; n=12, p<10-4). Similar results were
300     obtained indicative of significant and widespread overexcitation underlying the cessation
301     of activity in RS units, with 225 out of 331 (68%) RS units with sufficient rate at the time
                                                                        Page 12

303     Rmean,cess=0.30±0.03 [sem]; greater than 0 with p<10-7 by bootstrap mean resampling
304     test, nsample=20, Nbootstrap=50,000). However, amongst RS cells exhibiting a pause in
305     activity, membrane potential appeared much more heterogenous despite controlling for
306     firing rate at this time, appearing in a bimodal distribution amongst both inhibition and
307     depolarization block that was not significantly different from 0 (Extended Data Fig. 7e&f;
308     n=130; Rmean,cess=-0.08±0.06 [sem]; greater than 0 with p=0.3782, nsample=10,
309     Nbootstrap=50,000). This may be because RS cells receive a greater diversity of input
310     magnitudes during seizure progression than do FS cells but succumb to the same, more
311     uniform mechanism underlying depolarization block at firing rate cessation and seizure
312     transition, which we hypothesize is due to increasing potassium concentrations in the
313     extracellular environment shared by all of these cells.
314
315     This sequence of significant hyperpolarization in FS cells followed by large and
316     widespread overexcitation in all cells suggests a consistent membrane potential-based
317     mechanism by which local cortical circuits fight but ultimately succumb to seizure
318     progression. The dynamics in firing rate and action potential amplitude that characterize
319     this mechanism were accurately reproduced in a computational model of the cell
320     membrane incorporating voltage-dependent sodium and potassium conductances
321     (Hodgkin-Huxley formalism) with stochastic background synaptic input. The model
322     reproduced all of the observed mutual dynamics between action potential rate and
323     amplitude during inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) pauses versus depolarization-induced
                                                                        Page 13

328     DISCUSSION
329     We have shown that both FS and RS cells are strongly activated during the initial
330     spread of secondarily generalized seizures. The immediate increase in RS rate at
331     seizure onset, in particular, clearly indicates spread of the seizure, and not a failed
332     seizure in what has been called an ictal penumbra, where no initial increases in RS rate
333     appear32. Importantly, we have shown that both FS and RS cells can sometimes pause
334     their activity due to hyperpolarization (likely due to inhibition-mediated hyperpolarization
335     from other nearby inhibitory neurons) but stop firing midway through secondarily
336     generalized seizures due to depolarization block. This result is independent of seizure
337     etiology (cortical dysplasia vs. mesial temporal sclerosis) or site of origin (hippocampus
338     vs. neocortex). This suggests that there is an almost complete lack of FS-mediated
339     inhibition towards the end of a human seizure, in contrast to some animal models
340     without loss of inhibition18. FS cells are active near the beginning and middle of the
341     seizure, in contrast to computational models placing the loss of inhibitory restraint at
342     seizure onset37. Strikingly, this absence of FS inhibitory activity is accompanied by large
343     increases in the amplitude of the seizure’s LFP and unimpeded fast traveling waves, as
344     well as a short-lasting increase in RS firing. Thus, these results suggest a more
345     complicated set of dynamics than a monotonic increase or decrease of inhibition and
346     provide further insight into the associated biophysical mechanisms.
347
348     The main difference between RS and FS cell firing during the seizures observed here
349     was the significantly earlier cessation of spiking by FS cells, which is consistent with
350     previous results from in vitro models of seizure-like events showing increased
                                                                        Page 15

351     propensity of FS cells to enter depolarization block compared to pyramidal cells12,14,25.
352     The reason for this difference in propensity to enter depolarization block has not been
353     established, but these results suggest this difference could represent a primary source
354     of imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory cell activities that allows seizures to
355     propagate and transition to a large amplitude phase in human neocortex. One
356     hypothesis accounting for this difference is that of the differential expression of voltage-
357     gated potassium channel units in FS as opposed to RS cells38–40 in combination with the
358     elevated extracellular potassium ion levels known to occur in the context of
359     seizures41,42. However, there are several intrinsic and network-based properties that are
360     known to differ between FS cells and pyramidal cells and could contribute to this
361     difference, such as intrinsic excitability and the relative strength of feedforward drive43–
        46
362        . The results here suggest that properties responsible for increasing the propensity of
363     FS cells to enter depolarization block relative to RS cells are also those that allow the
364     propagation and exacerbation of seizures in human neocortex. Beyond seizure
365     progression, it is also possible that the lack of FS activity sets in motion a critical
366     network-level transition that leads to seizure termination47–49. This transition may include
367     the activation of inhibitory cell types other than FS cells22,59.
368
369     In summary, FS cells are the largest source of inhibition in the neocortex, and human
370     FS cells approach cessation less than halfway through a seizure, most likely due to
371     depolarization block. This is associated with a dramatic increase of the seizure’s local
372     field potential amplitude and a transition to clear spike-and-wave events at a frequency
373     of ~3 Hz. Rhythmic spike-and-wave discharges, when they occur in the motor cortex,
                                                                        Page 16

374     are responsible for the rhythmic ~3 Hz movements seen during the clonic phase of
375     tonic-clonic seizures50. Importantly, this suggests a novel, FS-dependent, mechanistic
376     explanation for the two behaviorally defined phases of secondarily generalized tonic-
377     clonic seizures: the high-FS-rate, low-LFP-amplitude phase of the seizure corresponds
378     to the tonic phase, whereas the post-FS-cessation phase with periodic spike-wave
379     bursts corresponds to a longer lasting clonic phase. Thus, in addition to existing
380     approaches51–55, novel therapies that prevent FS cells from entering depolarization
381     block may prevent - or at least limit the severity of - seizures, representing a novel and
382     potentially powerful avenue for treating seizures with many different etiologies.

385     METHODS
386     Patients & Clinical/Research Electrode Placement
387     Approval for all experiments was granted by the Institutional Review Boards of
388     Massachusetts General Hospital / Brigham & Women’s Hospital and Rhode Island
389     Hospital. The decision to implant intracranial electrodes in an epilepsy patient as well
390     the positioning of those electrodes in a patient was made solely on clinical factors by
391     clinical staff. The explicit goal of this study was to examine the single neuron correlates
392     of tonic-clonic seizures42 with focal onsets (also referred to as focal seizures with
393     secondary generalization), one of the most common kind of epilepsies56. These focal
394     seizures have a localized onset zone, either in the mesial temporal lobe or neocortex,
395     but secondarily generalize, spreading to both hemispheres and almost always leading
396     to impaired consciousness. Here, we studied data from 4 patients (Patients A,B,C,D)
397     with clear focal seizures with secondary generalization, with each of these clinical
398     seizures showing clear spike-and-wave patterns. Two additional patients with temporal-
399     lobe epilepsy were implanted with NeuroPort Arrays but not studied here because one
400     of them did not have any seizures while implanted (Patient E), and the NeuroPort Array
401     in the other patient did not sample any typical spike-and-wave seizures (Patient F). A
402     total of 10 secondarily generalized seizures with spike-and-wave discharges from the 4
403     patients were analyzed (3 each from Patients A and D; 2 each from Patients B and C).
404     A detailed clinical description of each of these 4 patients follows:
405     Patient A. Patient A was a left-handed man in his 30s at the time of his surgery. He had
406     suffered from pharmacologically intractable partial complex seizures for almost two
407     decades. His seizures lasted 1-2 minutes and were characterized by a sudden onset of
                                                                        Page 18

408     slurred and nonsensical speech. This was followed by a staring spell, lack of
409     responsiveness, and head turning to the right. He also displayed automatisms and
410     posturing that involved his right arm and hand more than his left. MRI suggested left
411     (dominant) temporal polymicrogyria. He underwent placement of grids and strips for ~2
412     weeks to delineate the seizure focus with respect to this area of abnormal sulcation. A
413     4x4 mm NeuroPort array with 1.5 mm long contacts was placed in the left superior
414     temporal gyrus. Seizures were found to emanate from the mesial temporal structures,
415     but during secondary generalization, the seizures spread to the location of the array in
416     the superior temporal gyrus and beyond. The patient underwent a left temporal
417     lobectomy, and histology confirmed that the microarray targeted layer 3. Pathology was
418     consistent with mesial temporal sclerosis.
419
420     Patient B. Patient B was a right-handed man in his 40s at the time of his surgery, with a
421     history of medically refractory epilepsy. His seizures lasted 1-2 minutes. Clinically, the
422     seizures started with arousal and bilateral arm and leg extension. This was followed by
423     leftward head deviation, left arm flexion, and generalized tonic-clonic activity. He
424     underwent placement of grids, strips, and depths in his right hemisphere. A 4x4 mm
425     NeuroPort array (with 1.5 mm deep contacts) was placed in the right middle temporal
426     gyrus. During secondary generalization, the seizures spread to the location of the
427     NeuroPort array in the middle temporal gyrus and beyond. The patient underwent a
428     right temporal lobectomy. Histology on the resected tissue confirmed that the microarray
429     targeted layer 3.

431     Patient C. Patient C was a left-handed woman in her 20s at the time of her surgery.
432     She started to have complex partial seizures at least 10 years prior to surgery. These
433     seizures included an aura of nausea and a ‘tunneling’ sensation, then a flattening of
434     affect, slowed responsiveness, automatisms, and associated amnesia. Such seizures
435     occurred 3-4 times per month and were persistent despite being on a three-drug
436     anticonvulsant regimen. MRI revealed an extensive nodular gray matter heterotopia in
437     the right hemisphere. Video-EEG monitoring had found right hemispheric onset
438     seizures, and fMRI had shown normal left sided language activation patterns and
439     normal motor activation patterns. Wada testing confirmed left hemispheric language
440     dominance and suggested her left hemisphere could adequately support memory
441     function subsequent to a right temporal lobectomy. Based on these data, she was
442     implanted with a combination of subdural grid and strip electrodes over the right
443     hemisphere and 3 depth electrodes into the right temporal lobe. The NeuroPort array
444     (with 1.5 mm deep contacts) was placed in the right middle temporal gyrus. Her
445     seizures lasted between 1-2.5 minutes. These showed very consistent patterns of
446     seizure onset and propagation on ECoG; all began in the right middle and upper gyri of
447     the posterior temporal cortex. Low amplitude and fast activity were recorded from these
448     grid sites at the onset, followed by a buildup of 11-13 Hz activities from these leads
449     which then spread anteriorly and inferiorly along the grid. Rhythmic spike-wave
450     discharges were also detected soon after seizure onset spreading to several locations,
451     including the location of the NeuroPort array in the right middle temporal gyrus. The
452     patient underwent an extensive right temporal resection with extension posteriorly
453     toward the right temporo-occipital junction but sparing of much of the mesial temporal
                                                                        Page 20

454     structures (including the hippocampus). Histology confirmed that the array targeted
455     layers 2/3. Pathology revealed subtle neuronal dysgenesis and focal superficial gliosis
456     and encephalomalacia in the posterior temporal neocortex, including the recorded
457     seizure-onset zone. Anterior temporal cortex showed mild gliosis.
458
459     Patient D. Patient D was a right-handed man in his 20s whose seizures began when he
460     was a teenager. His seizures were characterized by a blank stare and oral automatisms
461     accompanied by stiffening and posturing of the right hand. His MRI was unremarkable,
462     but his semiology and phase I EEG recordings suggested a left temporal seizure onset.
463     Consequently, he was implanted with several strip electrodes covering the left frontal
464     and temporal regions. The NeuroPort array (1.0 mm deep contacts) was placed in the
465     middle temporal gyrus about 1–2 cm posterior to the temporal tip. All of the seizures
466     had similar clinical and electrographic signatures with a left gaze preference at onset
467     followed by tonic and then clonic movements of the right arm. Electrographically, the
468     seizures began with a generalized burst of sharp waves followed by sharp wave com-
469     plexes that were maximal in mesial temporal leads. The participant underwent a left
470     temporal lobectomy. Histological examination of the tissue revealed mild dysplastic
471     changes in the lateral temporal neocortex and gliosis and moderate neuronal loss in
472     regions CA4 and CA3 of the hippocampus.

474     NeuroPort Recordings, Data Collection & Analysis
475     A Neuroport array (manufactured by Blackrock Microsystems) is a 10x10 grid of
476     electrodes with an inter-electrode spacing of 400 um, giving a total size of 4x4 mm. The
                                                                        Page 21

477     depth of the electrodes used in this study was either 1.5 mm (Patients A,B,C) or 1.0 mm
478     (Patient D). 96 of the 100 electrodes were used to record the activity of individual
479     neurons as well as the local field potential (LFP). The 0.3-7500 Hz wideband analog
480     signal from each electrode was referenced to a distant intracranial reference wire and
481     sampled at 30 kHz. The LFP shown in Figs. 1, 2, and Extended Data Fig. 1 were z-
482     scored, but not filtered any further. Traveling wave analysis & images (Fig. 3) made use
483     of these z-scored, unfiltered LFP signals. For single unit analysis, the broadband signal
484     was high-pass filtered above 250 Hz using a 6-pole Bessel filter and then manually
485     spike-sorted using Plexon Offline Sorter. We then classified the neurons as either fast-
486     spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons or regular-spiking (RS) excitatory cells using well-
487     established criteria27,28, including action potential shape. Cessation of firing during a
488     seizure was defined as the bin after which the firing rate never exceeded 30% of the
489     unit’s peak rate. For action-potential (AP) amplitude analysis (Fig. 4a), the AP amplitude
490     was defined as the trough-to-peak amplitude of each individual extracellular action
491     potential.
492
493     Cluster isolation quality assessment: Dynamic LRatio
494     To assess the isolation quality of feature space clusters over the course of seizures, we
495     employed a modified version of the Lratio metric of cluster separation introduced and
496     validated by Schmitzer-Torbert et al. (2005)58. This involved first calculating the
497     Mahalanobis distance of every spike to a given cluster’s center in a 4D feature space
498     consisting of trough-to-peak amplitude, trough-to-peak width, principal component 1,
499     and principal component 2. The Mahalanobis distance normalizes the Euclidean
                                                                        Page 22

500     distance by the variance of a given cluster along its major dimensions to correct for
501     correlations amongst features. Schmitzer-Torbert et al. (2005)58 showed strong error
502     rate correlation with ground truth extracellular spikes by assuming a multi-dimensional
503     Gaussian distribution for a given cluster and taking the amount of contamination by
504     false negative assignments to be the sum of probabilities of each un-clustered spike of
505     a given Mahalanobis distance to belong to that Gaussian, which was robust to the
506     particular feature space used. These probabilities are given by the inverse of the
507     cumulative distribution function of a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom
508     equal to the number of features in the features space, the sum of which is called L.
509     Because clusters in this space moved over the course of the seizure in a non-monotonic
510     pattern here, we calculated Mahalanobis distances to a surrogate cluster for multiple
511     subsets of the whole cluster at 8 equal divisions over the course of the seizure and 3
512     divisions of the 10 minute period that occurred two minutes after the end of the seizure.
513     A composite cluster across initial divisions was used to provide a liberal estimate of the
514     space that a given cluster might occupy despite early waveform shape changes. This
515     composite reference cluster included all available spikes before the seizure along with
516     those in the first two divisions of the seizure, which were generally well-sortable. We
517     calculated the sum of false negative assignment probabilities under a Gaussian model
518     for this reference cluster, the value L, for each seizure and post-seizure division. We
519     then dynamically normalized L by the number of spikes assigned to the cluster in each
520     time division to estimate contamination rates relative to the number of spikes assigned
521     during that division, which we refer to as the dynamic Lratio.

523     Membrane potential trajectory analysis
524     We exploited the biophysical relationship between depolarization, voltage-gated Na+
525     channel inactivation, and spike waveform shape60 to infer the direction of membrane
526     potential changes underlying the changes in firing rate exhibited by single units
527     recorded extracellularly in patients across time. This was done for a given unit by first
528     computing the local spike rate and average trough-to-peak waveform amplitude in
529     moving time windows of width 1 second unless otherwise specified, moving with a step
530     size of 0.1 seconds. Then a linear regression was performed at each point in this series
531     across a moving time window of 3 seconds, producing a time series of correlation
532     coefficients for bins with an average spike rate of at least 5 Hz. Strong negative
533     correlations were taken as evidence of firing rate changes associated with membrane
534     potential changes near resting membrane potential, while strong positive correlations
535     were taken as evidence of membrane potential changes closer to firing threshold, near
536     the regime of depolarization block56.
537
538     Computational model
539     Computer simulations of transmembrane voltage dynamics consistent with the
540     extracellular observations here were made in MATLAB R2017b to explore plausible
541     underlying biophysical mechanisms. A 4-dimensional ordinary differential equation
542     model of a patch of neural membrane following the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism of
543     passive (gL=0.033 mS/cm2, EL=-60 mV, IL=gL(V-EL)) and voltage-dependent spiking Na+
544     (gNa=60.0 mS/cm2, ENa=+58 mV, INa=gNam3h(V-ENa)) and K+ (gK=5 mS/cm2, EK=-85
545     mV, IK=gKn4(V-EK)) conductances was solved using Euler integration with a timestep of
                                                                        Page 24

546     0.005 msec. First order kinetics of gating variables m, h, and n were modeled as in
547     previously established models of this form57. Slowly changing net synaptic input and
548     extracellular ion gradient changes were considered to constitute a net external drive
549     modeled as an injected inward current. This current follows a temporal form
550     hypothesized to drive human neocortical neurons during secondarily generalized
551     seizures based on the dynamic membrane potential decoding analysis performed here.
552     Fast synaptic inputs were modeled as conductances with a maximum conductance
553     gsyn=0.15 mS/cm2 and an exponential decay time course of 5 milliseconds gated by
554     input spike times generated by a Poisson process with a linearly increasing rate
555     parameter from 0.001 to 0.2 Hz representing increasing input firing rates across seizure.
556     Analysis of the resulting spike trains was completed in the same manner as dynamic
557     membrane potential trajectory decoding was performed for the observed extracellular
558     data.
559
560     Statistical analyses
561     In performing hypothesis testing on various metrics describing activity amongst FS and
562     RS units including peak firing rate difference, mean cessation time difference, and mean
563     correlation between spike firing rate and action potential amplitude at time of cessation,
564     we employed bootstrap-based methods to quantify the uncertainty in these metrics. For
565     peak firing rate and cessation time differences this involved combining all relevant unit
566     measurements into a single population, randomly reshuffling RS and FS labels amongst
567     this population, and recomputing the relevant difference metrics Nbootstrap times as
568     indicated to generate a distribution of the metric for random unit classifications. The
                                                                        Page 25

569     probability of a Type-I (false positive) error, the p-value, was then reported as the area
570     under the distribution corresponding to values more extreme than the observed value
571     for the original data. For testing the positivity of the mean correlation between spike
572     firing rate and action potential amplitude at time of cessation, this involved first removing
573     correlation coefficients in the time series corresponding to a linear regressions involving
574     spike rates of less than 5 Hz. Then the coefficients at each unit’s detected cessation
575     time were resampled with replacement in 20 unit subpopulations 50,000 times (unless
576     otherwise specified) and averaged to generate a bootstrapped sample mean distribution
577     characterizing the variability in this mean relative to zero. The probability of a Type-I
578     (false positive) error that the observed mean coefficient was greater than zero by
579     chance, the p-value, was then reported as the area under the distribution corresponding
580     to values equal to or less than zero. To nonparametrically test the significance of
581     differences in paired measures at cessation and pause times within single units, we
582     employed the right-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test (RMatlab2017b).

607     relative to secondarily generalized focal seizure progression on local electrodes
608
609          a. Upper. Electrocorticogram trace (ECoG, black) from contact closest to source of focal seizure in
610               hippocampus of Patient A. Note its time of initiation at T = -20 seconds, substantially preceding
611               the start of the seizure in neocortex. Lower. The firing rate of a single FS cell (blue), the firing
612               rate of a single RS cell recorded from the same electrode (green) and the local field potential
613               (LFP, gray, recorded from the same electrode as the FS cell) during a seizure recorded from
614               Patient A. Note the decrease in LFP amplitude as the FS cell starts firing, followed by a dramatic
615               increase in LFP seizure amplitude after the FS cell decreases its rate at T=35 seconds. RS cell
616               quickly increases its firing rate as the seizure first spreads to the NeuroPort array (T=0 seconds),
617               then decreases in rate slightly as the FS cell switches on, and finally settles into a lower firing rate
618               regime during the large spike-and-wave events that dominates the remainder of the seizure after
619               FS cell cessation. Inset shows the mean normalized extracellular action potential waveforms (with
620               99% confidence intervals in lighter shading) of FS Cell 1 (blue) and the neighboring RS cell
621               (green). Inset 1: the mean normalized extracellular action potential waveforms (with 99%

624               Scale bar: 1 cm. Top left corner shows the array before implantation. Scale bar: 200 µm. Inset 3:

626               electrode tracts and an enlarged image (Right) showing that the array targeted layer 3 of the
627               neocortex. Scale bars: 400 µm.
628
629          b. The inset shows a schematic of the array and the location of two simultaneously recorded FS
630               cells separated by ~2 mm: FS Cell 1 (blue, firing rate shown in Fig. 1c) and FS Cell 2 (purple). FS
631               Cell 2 approached cessation at T=24 seconds, well before FS Cell 1. The LFP (grayish-purple)
632               recorded at the same location as FS Cell 2 dramatically increases at the same time as FS Cell 2
633               decreases firing, well before the increase seen in the LFP recorded next to FS Cell 1. These
634               suggest the activity of FS cells during human seizures is strongly correlated to the local intensity
635               of seizure waves. FS Cell 2 activity cessation again precedes a sharp increase in local RS cell
636               activity (gold), further suggesting an important role of FS cells in controlling local activity during
637               seizure progression.

640               array exhibiting classifiable units as each row, sorted by time of start of spike-and-wave event
641               and with brighter colors indicating larger amplitudes. Note the increasing delay to start of spike-
642               and-wave event suggesting different dynamics to seizure spread across the array over the
643               timecourse of approximately 20 seconds.

647               Note the increasing delay to reduction in spike density corresponding to LFP transition to spike-
648               and-wave events suggesting control of local seizure progression by local cellular spiking activity.

694               observed value simply by random assignment of cell type to each unit. Values on the right half
695               correspond to a positive difference between RS and FS cessation, with larger values associated
696               with increasing certainty that FS cells stop firing before RS cells. Values on the left half

719          a. An example of a traveling wave recorded 30 seconds after the start of a seizure in Patient A. The
720               FS cell located at the position marked “FS” was firing at high rates at this time. The 8 snapshots
721               (1-8) are taken over a 35 ms interval as the traveling LFP wave starts in the top-right corner of the
722               array and travels across the array. The traveling wave does not fully invade the region of
723               neocortex containing the active FS cell, resulting in lower amplitude LFPs around the FS cell. In
724               each subfigure, each square denotes a single LFP sensor, and white squares indicate omitted
725               sensors.

728               absence of FS cell firing, the epileptic traveling wave moves unimpeded through the array, fully
729               invading the region around the marked FS cell and resulting in larger amplitude LFPs at all
730               locations.

755               rate reduction in dotted lines in (A) is indicated with an arrow as “Pause” and the second time
756               period of firing rate reduction in dotted lines in (A) is indicated with an arrow as “Cessation.”

758          d. Firing rate of unit from (A) with neighboring FS unit firing rate overlaid, giving further evidence that
759               first period of firing rate suppression corresponds to inhibition from local FS units while second
760               period of firing rate suppression does not correspond to inhibition from local FS units.
761
762          e. Unit cessation-triggered population average of the time course of novel membrane potential
763               regime measure, i.e. the correlation coefficient relating spiking amplitude and rate in a local time
764               window, around the two significant descents in firing rate (below 30% of peak rate) that occur in
765               sequence during seizure. These are designated as pause (left panel) and cessation (right panel).
766               Left panel shows population average firing rate (blue) and inferred membrane potential regime
767               (black) aligned according to the time of pause in each unit, for all FS units displaying a pause
768               (n=14), with inset showing average for best-isolated FS units displaying a pause (n=10). Right
769               panel shows population average firing rate (red) and inferred membrane potential regime (black)
770               aligned according to the cessation time of each unit, for all FS units (n=37), with inset showing
771               average for best-isolated FS units (n=24).
772
773          f.   Probability distribution of membrane potential regime measure (spike rate-amplitude correlation;
774               black line) at the time of pause (left panel) for FS unit pausing subpopulation (n=14) with sample
775               mean distribution (gold line; resampling size n=10, Nbootstrap=50,000) showing the mean
776               correlation to be significantly below zero, i.e. in the hyperpolarized membrane potential regime
777               (blue). In combination with its declining firing rate, this is indicative of widespread inhibition across
778               this subpopulation at the time of pause. The population distribution of inferred membrane
779               potential regime is also shown at the time of cessation (right panel) for the full FS unit population
780               (n=37) with sample mean distribution (gold line; resampling size n=10, Nbootstrap=50,000) showing
781               the mean correlation to be significantly above zero, i.e. in the highly depolarized membrane
782               potential regime (red). This is indicative of widespread depolarization block occurring across FS
783               population at the time of cessation.
784
785          g. Unit cessation-triggered population average of the time course of same-electrode LFP amplitude
786               around unit activity pause (left panel) and cessation (right panel). In particular, left panel shows
787               population average firing rate (blue) and LFP amplitude (black) aligned according to the time of
788               pause in each unit, for all FS units displaying a pause (n=14). Right panel shows population
789               average firing rate (red) and LFP amplitude (black) aligned according to the time of cessation in
790               each unit, for all FS units (n=37), indicative of larger LFP increase associated with second FS
791               firing rate descent (cessation) than with first (pause) despite comparable local firing rates in the
792               two conditions.

820
821          e. Summary of observed dynamics in cell-type specific firing rate and inferred membrane
822               potential trajectories.
823               Blue box: Following seizure onset, some FS cells can stop firing for brief periods (as observed
824               on extracellular electrodes, upper panel). This pause in firing is coupled with signs of
825               hyperpolarization in the inferred membrane potential (lower panel).
826               Red box: As the seizure starts to transition to a dramatically higher amplitude FS cells stop firing
827               (as observed on extracellular electrodes, upper panel). This cessation is coupled with signs of
828               excessive depolarization in the inferred membrane potential (lower panel; resting membrane
829               potential indicated as dashed line). This is likely due to elevated extracellular potassium ion
830               concentrations by this point of the seizure or increased synaptic drive.
831               Green box: The subsequent stage of high amplitude spike-and-wave rhythms corresponds to a
832               transient increase and then decrease of firing rate amongst RS cells (as observed on extracellular
833               electrodes, upper panel). This decrease in firing rate is coupled with signs of excessive
834               depolarization in the inferred membrane potential (lower panel).

847     Extended Data Figure 1: Human neural activity classification
848          a. Average waveform of each FS-classified unit, normalized by the value the waveform reaches at
849               its trough. The overlaid average waveforms show visual consistency amongst all units classified
850               as FS and as having spike widths narrower than those of RS-classified units.
851          b. Average waveform of each RS-classified unit, normalized by the value the waveform reaches at
852               its trough. The overlaid average waveforms show visual consistency amongst all units classified
853               as RS and as having spike widths wider than those of FS-classified units.
854          c. All units indicated as points in the average waveform feature space that produced optimal cluster
855               separation, namely the width of the waveform at the potential corresponding to 15% of the
856               potential at its trough and the time between the trough and peak of the waveform. Clustering was
857               automated using a Gaussian Mixture Model where points with posterior probability exceeding
858               0.95 were assigned to the closest centroid. Black dots indicate units that did not exceed this
859               threshold for either Gaussian cloud and were thus unclassified and not used in the remainder of
860               the study.
861          d. Mahalanobis distance of each unit from both the RS and FS clusters with color indicating its
862               posterior probability of belonging to the RS cluster. Closeness of points to both axes shows that
863               the clusters are well-separated when accounting for their different variances along different
864               directions in feature space.

 963               corresponding to over-excitation ending in firing rate cessation putatively though depolarization
 964               block.
 965          b.   Example of negative correlation (left) between local spike rate and amplitude in first time period
 966               indicated by dotted lines in (A) and example of positive correlation (right) between local spike rate
 967               and amplitude in second time period indicated by dotted lines in (A). Least squares linear fit
 968               indicated in dotted lines following color scheme in (A) with Pearson’s correlation coefficient
 969               indicated above each plot.
 970          c.   Trajectory of unit activity over time during seizure in local spike rate vs spike amplitude space,
 971               with increasing time indicated by increasingly lighter copper color. The first time period of firing
 972               rate reduction in dotted lines in (A) is indicated with an arrow as “Pause” and the second time
 973               period of firing rate reduction in dotted lines in (A) is indicated with an arrow as “Cessation.”
 974          d.   Firing rate of unit from (A) with neighboring FS unit firing rate overlaid, giving further evidence that
 975               first period of firing rate suppression corresponds to inhibition from local FS units while second
 976               period of firing rate suppression does not correspond to inhibition from local FS units.
 977          e.   Unit cessation-triggered population average of the time course of novel membrane potential
 978               regime measure, i.e. the correlation coefficient relating spiking amplitude and rate in a local time
 979               window, around the two significant descents in firing rate (below 30% of peak rate) that occur in
 980               sequence during seizure. These are designated as pause (left panel) and cessation (right panel).
 981               Left panel shows population average firing rate (blue) and inferred membrane potential regime
 982               (black) aligned according to the time of pause in each unit, for all RS units displaying a pause
 983               (n=176), with inset showing average for best-isolated RS units displaying a pause (n=41). Right
 984               panel shows population average firing rate (red) and inferred membrane potential regime (black)
 985               aligned according to the cessation time of each unit, for all RS units meeting cessation criteria
 986               (n=379), with inset showing average for best-isolated RS units (n=111).
 987          f.   Probability distribution of membrane potential regime measure (spike rate-amplitude correlation;
 988               black line) at the time of pause (left panel) for RS unit pausing subpopulation (n=176) with sample
 989               mean distribution (gold line; resampling size n=10, Nbootstrap=50,000) showing a bimodal
 990               distribution of correlation coefficients near +1 and -1 , i.e. in the hyperpolarized membrane
 991               potential regime (blue) or in the highly depolarized regime (red). The population distribution of
 992               inferred membrane potential regime is also shown at the time of cessation (right panel) for the RS
 993               unit population meeting cessation criteria (n=379) with sample mean distribution (gold line;
 994               resampling size n=10, Nbootstrap=50,000) showing the mean correlation to be significantly above
 995               zero, i.e. in the highly depolarized membrane potential regime (red). This is indicative of
 996               widespread depolarization block occurring across RS population at the time of cessation.
 997          g.   Unit cessation-triggered population average of the time course of same-electrode LFP amplitude
 998               around unit activity pause (left panel) and cessation (right panel). In particular, left panel shows
 999               population average firing rate (blue) and LFP amplitude (black) aligned according to the time of
1000               pause in each unit, for all RS units displaying a pause (n=176). Right panel shows population
1001               average firing rate (red) and LFP amplitude (black) aligned according to the time of cessation in
1002               each unit, for all RS units (n=379).

1026     Extended Data Figure 9: Seizure progression is consistently associated with extracellular signs of
1027     depolarization block preceded by inhibition in single units.
1028          a. Firing rate (upper) and trough-to-peak spike amplitude (lower) of another example RS unit in
1029               Patient A, color-coded by the local correlation between spike rate and amplitude (in 1 second
1030               time bins) as an extracellular proxy for membrane potential and subthreshold input history. Firing
1031               rate of local FS unit is overlaid as purple histogram. Dotted lines indicate start and end times of
1032               two time periods of firing rate suppression characterized by different membrane potential
1033               signatures further characterized in (B), namely a negative correlation regime corresponding to
1034               inhibition followed by a positive correlation regime corresponding to over-excitation ending in
1035               firing rate cessation putatively though depolarization block.
1036          b. Example of negative correlation (left) between local spike rate and amplitude in first time period
1037               indicated by dotted lines in (A) and example of positive correlation (right) between local spike rate
1038               and amplitude in second time period indicated by dotted lines in (A). Least squares linear fit
1039               indicated in dotted lines following color scheme in (A) with Pearson’s correlation coefficient
1040               indicated above each plot.
1041          c. Trajectory of unit activity over time during seizure in local spike rate vs spike amplitude space,
1042               with increasing time indicated by increasingly lighter copper color. RS unit is released from
1043               inhibition shortly following the cessation of activity in local FS unit as indicated by increasing firing
1044               rate with decreasing amplitude but then enters regime of over-excitation indicated by decreasing
1045               firing rate with decreasing amplitude at trajectory “corner” corresponding to a spiking rate of 40
1046               Hz, until the unit ceases to fire likely due to depolarization block given these indicators of
1047               membrane potential history.
