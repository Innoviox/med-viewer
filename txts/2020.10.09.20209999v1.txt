    ABSTRACT
    Background: Understanding determinants of developing severe COVID-19 disease is important
    as studies show that severe disease is associated with worse outcomes.
    Objective: The study aimed to assess the determinants of COVID-19 disease severity among
    COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.
    Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from June to August 2020 among randomly
    selected 686 patients. Chi-square test was used to detect the presence of a statistically significant
    difference in the characteristics of the patients based on disease severity (Mild Vs Moderate Vs
    Severe), where p-value of <0.05 was considered as having a statistically significant difference. A
    Multivariable multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of a
    significant association between the independent variables and COVID-19 disease severity where
    Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR and P-values were used for testing significance
    and interpretation of results.
    Results: Having moderate as compared with mild disease was significantly associated with
    having hypertension (AOR= 2.302, 95% CI= 1.266, 4.184, p-value=0.006), diabetes mellitus
    (AOR=2.607, 95% CI= 1.307, 5.198, p-value=0.007 for diabetes mellitus), fever (AOR= 6.115,
    95% CI= 2.941, 12.716, p-value=0.0001) and headache (AOR= 2.695, 95% CI= 1.392, 5.215, p-
                                                                                                                                               1

    value=0.003). Similarly, having severe disease as compared with mild disease was associated
    with age group (AOR= 4.428, 95% CI= 2.497, 7.853, p-value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and
    AOR=18.070, 95% CI=9.292, 35.140, p-value=0.0001 for ≥ 60 years), sex (AOR=1.842, 95%
    CI=1.121, 3.027, p-value=0.016), hypertension (AOR= 1.966, 95% CI= 1.076, 3.593, p-
    value=0.028), diabetes mellitus (AOR= 3.926, 95% CI= 1.964, 7.847, p-value=0.0001), fever
    (AOR= 13.218, 95% CI= 6.109, 28.601, p-value=0.0001) and headache (AOR= 4.816, 95% CI=
    2.324, 9.979, p-value=0.0001). In addition, determinants of severe disease as compared with
    moderate disease were found to be age group (AOR= 4.871, 95% CI= 2.854, 8.315, p-
    value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and AOR= 18.906, 95% CI= 9.838, 36.334, p-value=0.0001 for ≥
    60 years), fever (AOR= 2.161, 95% CI= 1.286, 3.634, p-value=0.004) and headache (AOR=
    1.787, 95% CI= 1.028, 3.107, p-value=0.039).
    Conclusions: Being old, male sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and having symptoms of
    fever and headache were found to be determinants of developing a more severe COVID-19
    disease category. We recommend a better preventive practice to be set in place so that these
    groups of patients can be protected from acquiring the disease. And for those who are already
    infected, a more careful follow-up and management should be given so that complication and
    death can be prevented. Furthermore, considering the above non respiratory symptoms as disease
    severity indicator could be important.

    INTRODUCTION
    In Ethiopia, the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed 2 days after the World Health
    Organization has declared the disease to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020. According to the
    Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health Daily COVID-19 report, As of October 2, 2020, there were
    a total of 44, 101 active cases with 296 critical patients1.
    Studies show that severe disease seems to be determined by socio-demographic characteristics
    including male sex and older age. Having a history of pre-existing co-morbid illness particularly
    hypertension, diabetes, severe asthma, cancer, renal disease, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular
    diseases, and other co-morbidities were also found to be predictors of severe disease2-10.
    Disease severity is also reported to be associated with lower oxygen saturation and abnormal
    laboratory markers including higher levels of leukocyte count, neutrophil count, high sensitivity
    C reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, interleukin 2,6 and 8 receptors, tumor necrosis factor α,
    D-dimer, fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, cytokine,
    LDH and lower levels of CD4 count and deranged lymphocyte count 8,11-13.
                                                                                                                                       2

    Knowing determinants of developing severe disease is important as severe disease is associated
    with worse outcome so that stratified and focused patient management and preventive practices
    can be provided.
    Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the determinants of disease among COVID-
    19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
    METHODS AND MATERIALS
    Study Design, Setting and Population
    An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Millennium COVID-19 Care Center
    (MCCC), a 1000 bed makeshift hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
    The source population was all patients admitted to MCCC with a confirmed diagnosis of
    COVID-19 using RT-PCR from June to August 2020.
    The study population was all selected COVID-19 patients who were on treatment and follow up
    at MCCC during the three month period and who full fill the inclusion criteria.
    Sample Size Determination and Sampling Technique
    The sample size to identify determinants of disease severity was determined using a double
    population proportion formula with the assumptions of; 95% confidence interval, power of 80%,
    the proportion of males who had severe disease as 0.80, proportion of females who had non-
    severe disease as 0.75 and considering a non-response rate of 10%. Therefore, the total sample
    size calculated becomes 689 COVID-19 patients.
    A simple random sampling method was used to select the study participants.
    Eligibility criteria
    All COVID-19 patients who were admitted to MCCC during the three months follow-up period
    and who consented to participate were included in the study.
    Operational Definitions
    COVID-19 disease 14:
         -    Mild Disease: characterized by fever, malaise, cough, upper respiratory symptoms,
              and/or less common features of COVID-19 (headache, loss of taste or smell etc…)
         -    Moderate Disease: Patients with lower respiratory symptom/s. They may have infiltrates
              on chest X-ray. These patients are able to maintain oxygenation on room air.
         -    Severe COVID-19 disease: Includes patients who have developed complications. The
              following features can define severe illness.
                                                                                                                                       3

              o Hypoxia: SPO2 ≤ 93% on atmospheric air or PaO2:FiO2 < 300mmHg (SF ratio <
                   315)
              o Tachypnea: in respiratory distress or RR>30 breaths/minutes
              o More than 50% involvement seen on chest imaging
    Data Collection Procedures and Quality Assurance
    An interviewer-administered questionnaire that consists of the variables of interest was
    developed from the patient registration and follow up form and used to collect the necessary data
    from the patients and their medical charts.
    The data collection tool was pretested on 5% of randomly selected patients and their medical
    charts which were not included in the final data collection and necessary amendment on the data
    collection tool was made.
    Training on the basics of the questionnaire and data collection technique was given for ten data
    collectors (BSc nurses and General practitioners) and two supervisors (General practitioner and
    public health specialist).
    Data consistency and completeness was checked before an attempt was made to enter the code
    and analyze the data.
    Data Management and Analysis
    The extracted data were coded, entered into Epi-Info version 7.2.1.0, cleaned, stored, and
    exported to SPSS version 23.0 software for analysis. Categorical covariates were summarized
    using frequencies and percentages and numerical variables were summarized with a mean value.
    A Chi-square test was run to compare the underlying characteristics of the patients based on
    disease severity. The assumption of Chi-square test, that no cell should have an expected
    frequency of less than five was checked before the analysis, and the assumption was met. A
    statistically significant difference was detected for variables with a P-value of ≤ 0.05.
    The association between disease severity and determinant variables were analyzed using
    Multinomial Logistic Regression. Univariate analysis was done at 25% level of significance to
    screen out independent variables used in the multivariable multinomial Logistic regression
    model. The adequacy of the final model was assessed using goodness of fit test and the final
    model fitted the data well (Pearson x2(118) =141.005, p-value = 0.073 and Deviance x2(118)
    =134.542, p-value = 0.142). For the multinomial Logistic regression, 95% confidence interval
    for AOR was calculated and variables with p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered as statistically
    associated with COVID-19 disease severity at admission.
                                                                                                                                       4

    RESULT
    Socio-demographic, co-morbid illness and disease related characteristics and comparison
    based on disease severity
    From the 689 samples selected, information was collected from 686 patients making the response
    rate 99.5%. Almost half (49.3%) of the patients were less than 40 years. The majority (63.1%)
    were males. Two hundred sixty-seven (38.9%) of the patients had a history of one or more co-
    morbid illnesses. The commonest co-morbid illness in the study population was hypertension
    (21.1%), followed by diabetes mellitus (16.6%) and Asthma (4.7%). Twenty-five (3.6%) of the
    patients were Khat chewers.
    A statistically significant difference in disease severity was found among the different groups of
    patients by age group, sex, co-morbid illness, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. A significant
    proportion of patients 40 to 59 years (29.4% Vs 29.9% Vs 40.6%, p-value=0.0001) and ≥ 60
    years (16.6% Vs 16.6% Vs 66.9%, p-value=0.0001) had severe disease and the younger age
    group of < 40 years had mild disease (46.2% Vs 41.1% Vs 12.7%, p-value=0.0001). Based on
    sex, a significantly higher proportion of female patients had mild disease (41.1% Vs 31.2% Vs
    27.7%, p-value=0.021). On the contrary, males had severe disease (31.2% Vs 33.3% Vs 35.6%,
    p-value=0.021). A significantly higher proportion of patients with one or more co-morbid
    illnesses had severe disease followed by moderate and then mild disease (20.6% Vs 30.3% Vs
    49.1%, p-value=0.0001). Similarly, patients with hypertension (17.2% Vs 29.7% Vs 53.1%, p-
    value=0.0001) and diabetes (12.3% Vs 28.9% Vs 58.8%, p-value=0.0001) had severe disease
    followed by moderate and then mild disease. (Table 1)

    Results of determinants of COVID-19 disease severity (Mild Vs Moderate Vs Severe)
    Based on the result of the Univariate analysis at 25% level of significance; Age group, sex,
    hypertension, diabetes mellitus, fever, and headache were found to be significantly associated
    with COVID-19 disease severity (Mild Vs Moderate Vs Severe).
    On the multivariable multinomial logistic regression at 5% level of significance; age group,
    hypertension, diabetes mellitus, fever, and headache were found to be significantly associated
    with COVID-19 disease severity.
    Accordingly, after adjusting for other covariates, for patients in the age range of 40 to 59 years
    and ≥ 60 years, the odds of having severe disease as compared with mild disease were 4.428 and
    18.070 times than patients < 40 years, respectively (AOR= 4.428, 95% CI= 2.497, 7.853, p-
    value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and AOR=18.070, 95% CI= 9.292, 35.140, p-value=0.0001 for ≥
    60 years). Similarly, the odds of having severe disease as compared with moderate disease
    among patients 40 to 59 years and ≥ 60 years were 4.871 and 18.906 times than patients < 40
    years, respectively (AOR= 4.871, 95% CI= 2.854, 8.315, p-value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and
    AOR= 18.906, 95% CI= 9.838, 36.334, p-value=0.0001 for ≥ 60 years). But age group didn’t
    show a significant association with disease severity between moderate and mild cases.
    A significant association of sex with disease severity was found only between severe cases as
    compared with mild. Being male was associated with a 1.842 odds of having severe disease as
    compared with mild disease than females (AOR=1.842, 95% CI=1.121, 3.027, p-value=0.016).
    Regarding co-morbid illness, having hypertension and diabetes was significantly associated with
    disease severity between moderate Vs mild and moderate Vs severe disease, but not between
    severe Vs moderate disease. For patients with hypertension and diabetes, the odds of having
    moderate disease as compared with mild disease were 2.302 and 2.607 times compared to
    patients with no such illnesses, respectively (AOR= 2.302, 95% CI= 1.266, 4.184, p-value=0.006
                                                                                                                                       7

     for hypertension and AOR= 2.607, 95% CI= 1.307, 5.198, p-value=0.007 for diabetes mellitus).
     Similarly, the odds of having severe disease as compared with mild disease for hypertensive and
     diabetic patients were 1.966 and 3.926 times patients with no such illnesses, respectively (AOR=
     1.966, 95% CI= 1.076, 3.593, p-value=0.028 for hypertension and AOR= 3.926, 95% CI= 1.964,
     7.847, p-value=0.0001 for diabetes mellitus).
     Concerning presenting symptom, having fever and headache was significantly associated with
     disease severity; moderate Vs mild, severe Vs mild, and severe Vs moderate. The odds of having
     moderate disease as compared with mild disease for patients with fever and headache were 6.115
     and 2.695 times than patients with no such symptoms, respectively (AOR= 6.115, 95% CI=
     2.941, 12.716, p-value=0.0001 for fever; AOR= 2.695, 95% CI= 1.392, 5.215, p-value=0.003 for
     headache). The odds of having severe disease as compared with mild disease for patients with
     fever and headache were 13.218 and 4.816 times than patients with no such symptoms,
     respectively (AOR= 13.218, 95% CI= 6.109, 28.601, p-value=0.0001 for fever; AOR= 4.816,
     95% CI= 2.324, 9.979, p-value=0.0001 for headache). Similarly, the odds of having severe
     disease as compared with mild disease for patients with fever and headache were 2.161 and
     1.787 times compared to patients with no such symptoms, respectively (AOR= 2.161, 95% CI=

     DISCUSSION
     The current study tried to assess the determinants of COVID-19 disease severity among patients
     admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia. The chi-square test result shows
     that developing a more sever disease category was observed among older age groups, male sex,
     pre-existing one or more co-morbid illness history, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, fatigue,
     fever, headache, sorethroat, arthralgia, myalgia, and runny nose. This shows that old age, male
     sex, comorbid illness, and having any symptoms could be used as an indicator of the possibility
     of developing more severe disease.
     On the multivariable multinomial logistic regression at 5% level of significance; age group,
     hypertension, diabetes mellitus, fever, and headache were found to be significantly associated
     with COVID-19 disease severity.
     Age group was one of the identified significant determinants of disease severity. For patients in
     the age range of 40 to 59 years and ≥ 60 years, the odds of having severe disease as compared
     with mild disease were 4.428 and 18.070 times than patients < 40 years, respectively. Similarly,
     the odds of having severe disease as compared with moderate disease among patients 40 to 59
     years and ≥ 60 years were 4.871 and 18.906 times than patients < 40 years, respectively. But age
     group didn’t show a significant association with disease severity between moderate and mild
     cases. That means patients 40 years and above are at risk of developing more severe disease with
     the risk being much higher (18 fold) for those 60 years and above. This could be associated with
     the vulnerable nature of old age group due to a natural diminishing of the body’s defense
     mechanism and also the increased possibility of having concomitant comorbid illnesses that
     might not even be diagnosed, especially in the developing world with inadequate screening
     services, that further compromises the immune system. In another unpublished study conducted
                                                                                                                                        9

    in our Center, older patients were found to be at risk of developing symptomatic infection
    compared to the younger group showing that older patients are susceptible to have a worse
    disease presentation and severity that could lead to a worse prognosis.
    Being male was associated with a 1.842 odds of having severe disease as compared with mild
    disease than females. This significant difference in disease severity could be attributed to the
    identified difference in the disease biochemical activity between the two sexes showing that
    Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2, is found to be naturally
    abundant among males making it more convenient for high viral replication and development of
    symptomatic and severe disease compared to females 15-21.
    For patients with hypertension and diabetes, the odds of having moderate disease as compared
    with mild disease were 2.302 and 2.607 times compared to patients with no such illnesses,
    respectively. Similarly, the odds of having severe disease as compared with mild disease for
    hypertensive and diabetic patients were 1.966 and 3.926 times patients with no such illnesses,
    respectively. As explained above, since having one or more co-morbid illness results in a
    decreased immune defense mechanism of the body, it increases the patients’ probability of
    developing a disease from any infectious agent. This effect is accelerated if the comorbid
    illness/s is not well controlled. Furthermore, patients with comorbidity tend to be older, that in-
    turn adds to the existing decrease in immunity. This finding is also supported by other studies

               .
    In addition, the other important factors that determine disease severity were fever and headache.
    The odds of having moderate disease as compared with mild disease for patients with fever and
    headache were 6.115 and 2.695 times than patients with no such symptoms, respectively. The
    odds of having severe disease as compared with mild disease for patients with fever and
    headache were 13.218 and 4.816 times than patients with no such symptoms, respectively.
    Similarly, the odds of having severe disease as compared with mild disease for patients with
    fever and headache were 2.161 and 1.787 times compared to patients with no such symptoms,
    respectively. That means, having symptoms from COVID-19 infection are associated with
    developing a more severe disease as compared to the asymptomatic patients. Though these
    symptoms are not directly related to the disease severity classification in the study set up; like
    symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain, they are found to be significant
    determinants of disease severity. This implies that non-respiratory symptoms also might have a
    predictive value in disease categorization.

    CONCLUSION
    The following factors were identified to be significant determinants of developing a more severe
    COVID-19 disease; being 40 years and above (especially 60 years and above), male sex,
    hypertension, diabetes, and having symptoms of fever and headache.
    We recommend to aware the public to take extra precaution so that these vulnerable groups of
    patients can be protected from getting infected. It is also important to have a target group
    oriented screening for early detection of the disease for a better outcome. In addition, considering
    symptoms of fever and headache as indicators of a more severe disease category could be
    important.
