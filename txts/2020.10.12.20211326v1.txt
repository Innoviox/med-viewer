26    Abstract
27
28    Objectives: Sepsis is a growing concern for health systems, but the epidemiology of sepsis
29    is poorly characterised. We evaluated sepsis recording across primary care electronic
30    records, hospital episodes and mortality registrations.
31    Methods and Findings: Cohort study including 378 general practices in England from
32    Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database from 2002 to 2017 with
33    36,209,676 patient-years of follow-up with linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and
34    Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality registrations. Incident sepsis episodes were
35    identified for each source. Concurrent records from different sources were identified and
36    age-standardised and age-specific incidence rates compared. Logistic regression analysis
37    evaluated associations of gender, age-group, fifth of deprivation and period of diagnosis with
38    concurrent sepsis recording.
39    There were 20,206 first episodes of sepsis from primary care, 20,278 from HES and 13,972
40    from ONS. There were 4,117 (20%) first HES sepsis events and 2,438 (17%) mortality
41    records concurrent with incident primary care sepsis records within 30 days. Concurrent
42    HES and primary care records of sepsis within 30 days before or after first diagnosis were
43    higher at younger or older ages and for patients with the most recent period of diagnosis with
44    those diagnosed during 2007:2011 less likely to have a concurrent HES record given CPRD
45    compared to those diagnosed during 2012 to 2017 (odd ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval
46    0.60 to 0.70). At age 85 and older, primary care incidence was 5.22 per 1,000 patient years
47    (95% CI 1.75 to 11.97) in men and 3.55 (0.87 to 9.58) in women which increased to 10.09
48    (4.86 to 18.51) for men and 7.22 (2.96 to 14.72) for women after inclusion of all three
49    sources.
50    Conclusion: Explicit recording of sepsis is inconsistent across healthcare sectors with a
51    high proportion of non-concurrent records. Incidence estimates are higher when linked data
52    are analysed.

56    Introduction
57    Sepsis is a growing concern for health systems. In the UK, sepsis is estimated to account for
58    36,900 deaths and 123,000 hospital admissions annually [1]. The Global Burden of Disease
59    Study estimated that there were nearly 50 million incident cases of sepsis worldwide in 2017,
60    with 11 million deaths representing 19·7% of global deaths [2]. The term sepsis was
61    introduced by ancient Greek physicians, but only in recent years has sepsis come to be
62    defined as a syndrome resulting from the interaction between an acute infection and host
63    response leading to new organ dysfunction [3]. Sepsis is an intermediate state that links an
64    infection, or an infection-causing condition, to adverse health outcomes. The term sepsis is
65    now more commonly used than the term ‘septicaemia’, which refers to blood-stream
66    infection. In the health care systems of high-income countries, records of ‘sepsis’ have been
67    increasing in both hospital and primary care settings [4-6]. A study from the U.S.
68    Massachusetts General Hospital [7] found that recording of severe sepsis or septic shock
69    increased by 706% in the decade between 2003 and 2012, while objective markers of
70    severe infection, including positive blood cultures, remained stable or decreased. In a large
71    study from UK primary care the incidence of sepsis diagnoses increased throughout the
72    period from 2002 to 2017, with an especially rapid increase since 2011 [6]. Alongside
73    increasing use of the term sepsis, case definitions have expanded to include patients with
74    evidence of both acute infection and acute organ dysfunction as having ‘implicit sepsis’ even
75    when sepsis was not explicitly diagnosed [8, 2].
76
77    Accurate surveillance of sepsis and other bacterial infections is of importance in the context
78    of antimicrobial resistance which can limit options for effective treatment [9]. Antimicrobial
79    stewardship is a strategy to optimise antibiotic prescribing practices to prevent increasing
80    antimicrobial resistance, aiming to strike a balance between effective management of
81    suspected infection and avoidance of inappropriate or unnecessary antibiotic use [10]. The
82    recent increase in sepsis has been accompanied by heightened awareness of antimicrobial
                                                                                                                                  3

 83    resistance and antimicrobial stewardship, raising safety concerns about the potential for
 84    increased rates of serious bacterial infections if antibiotics are not used when needed [11].
 85
 86    Electronic health records provide an important data resource for epidemiological research
 87    and health surveillance, especially in health care settings. Data linkage provides
 88    opportunities to enhance the completeness of ascertainment of health events across health
 89    service sectors and population health registries. The advantages of linked records for case
 90    ascertainment have been demonstrated for long-term conditions [12-15], but research into
 91    the use of linked records for the evaluation of infectious diseases has been limited. However,
 92    studies investigating the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia indicate that primary
 93    care data alone may lead to under-estimation of the burden of infections [16, 17].
 94
 95    This study aimed to exploit data linkage to evaluate the recording of sepsis across primary
 96    care electronic health records, hospital episodes and mortality registrations for individual
 97    patients registered at general practices in England. We conducted a population-based cohort
 98    study to compare simultaneous recording of sepsis in primary care, hospital episodes and
 99    mortality data and to estimate the incidence of sepsis from different data sources.

102    Methods
103
104    Study Population & Data Sources
105    The study employed the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database.
106    The CPRD GOLD is a primary care database of anonymised electronic health records for
107    general practices in the UK. The high quality of CPRD GOLD data is well-established [18].
108    CPRD GOLD has a coverage of some 11.3 million patients, including approximately 7% of
109    UK population, of which it is broadly representative in terms of age and sex [19]. Consenting
110    practices in England participate in a data linkage scheme [20]. Approximately 74% of all
111    CPRD GOLD practices in England are eligible for linkage. Linkages are available for the
112    Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and mortality registration data from the Office for National
113    Statistics (ONS). HES admitted patient care data include admission and discharge dates and
114    diagnostic data coded using the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision
115    (ICD10). Mortality registration data include information for the date and causes of death
116    coded using ICD10. ONS identifies one underlying cause of death and secondary causes of
117    death including up to 15 additional causes of death. Linked area-based measures of
118    deprivation include the Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) based on a weighted profile of
119    indicators [21]. We employed deprivation for the general practice postcode for this study
120    because of the low proportion of missing values. The protocol was approved by the CPRD
121    Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC protocol 18-041R).
122
123    Main measures
124    We included patient records between 1st January 2002 to 31st December 2017. The start of
125    the patient record was the later of the patient registration date or the date the general
126    practice joined CPRD. The end of the patient record was the earliest of the last data
127    collection date, the end of registration and the date of death. We evaluated first records of
128    sepsis more than 12 months after start of registration in primary care electronic health
                                                                                                                                   5

129    records, or as a primary diagnosis in HES, or sepsis as any mentioned cause of death in
130    mortality records. In UK primary care records, diagnoses recorded at consultations or
131    referrals to or from hospitals were coded, at the time of this study, using Read codes. We
132    identified sepsis records using a list of 77 eligible Read codes. Incident episodes of sepsis in
133    CPRD were recorded using 55 Read codes with four codes accounting for 92% of events,
134    including ‘Sepsis’ (two codes) (64%), ‘Septicaemia’ (18%), and ‘Urosepsis’ (10%). In HES
135    and death registry records, sepsis diagnoses and sepsis deaths were defined using 23
136    ICD10 codes for sepsis. In HES records we evaluated the primary diagnosis, which accounts
137    for the majority of the length of stay of the episode, with other diagnoses being referred to as
138    comorbidities [22]. Incident diagnoses of sepsis in HES were coded with 20 ICD10 codes
139    with three codes accounting for 89% of events, including ‘Sepsis, unspecified’ (72%),
140    ‘Sepsis due to other Gram-negative organisms’ (13%) and
141    ‘Sepsis due to Staphylococcus aureus’ (5%). In mortality data, we included all mentioned
142    causes of death because sepsis may be part of a sequence of morbid events and not always
143    an underlying cause of death [23]. ‘Sepsis, unspecified’ accounted for 93% of causes of
144    death among those in the ONS death registry with sepsis as any mentioned cause of death.
145
146    Analysis
147    Incident sepsis events were identified for each data source. We calculated person-time at
148    risk from the start to the end of the patient record. Person-time was grouped by gender and
149    age-group from zero to four, five to nine and 10 to 14 and then 10 years age groups up to 85
150    years and over. Incidence and mortality rates were age-standardised using the European
151    standard population for reference. We searched for concurrent events across data sources
152    using a 30-day time-window. We calculated age-specific incidence rates using primary care
153    EHRs and then adding HES records, mortality records or both. Finally, we fitted a logistic
154    regression model to evaluate associations of gender, age-group, fifth of deprivation and
                                                                                                                                   6

156    3.6.3.
157
158    Sensitivity analyses
159    In order to consider recurrent sepsis events, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using
160    CPRD and HES where incident events were first sepsis records during each calendar year
161    during the study period. We also evaluated the effect of extending the time-window for
162    concurrent events from 30 to 90 days.

167    Incidence of sepsis in each data source
168    There were 4,081,214 registered patients from 378 general practices, who were eligible for
169    linkage and contributed 36,209,676 patient-years (PY) of follow-up. There were 20,206
170    patients with a first episode of sepsis recorded in primary care EHRs, 20,278 in HES and
171    13,972 in ONS. The characteristics of patients with sepsis from each data source are
172    presented in Table 1. Each data source showed a slightly higher proportion of females than
173    males (CPRD: 51%; HES: 52%; ONS: 55%). The frequency of sepsis increased with age,
174    with a maximum over 75 years of age. The most deprived IMD quintile had the highest
175    proportion of sepsis cases for each data source for men and women (25% to 26%) and the
176    least deprived quintile consistently had the lowest (15% to 17%). The number of first sepsis
177    events increased over time for primary care and hospital records with more first episode
178    sepsis cases in the period 2012:2017 for both males and females. In CPRD, the period
179    2012:2017 accounted for 44% of sepsis episodes for men and 42% for women; in HES the
180    latest period accounted for 50% of cases for both genders. This increasing trend was not
181    apparent in mortality records. The period with the highest number of sepsis deaths in the
182    ONS file was 2007:2011.

184    Annual age- and gender-standardised incidence of sepsis is shown for each data source in
185    Figure 1. Primary care electronic records showed a steady increase in sepsis cases over the
186    study period, with an acceleration from 2012 to 2017. In the CPRD in 2002, the age-
187    standardised incidence was 0.35 (95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.39) per 1,000 PYs in
188    males and 0.34 (0.30 to 0.37) per 1,000 PYs in females. By 2017, this increased to 1.15
189    (1.04 to 1.26) per 1,000 PYs among males and 1.10 per 1,000 PYs among females (95% CI
190    1.00 to 1.19). Consistent with primary care data, HES data showed a steep increase in
191    sepsis cases over the study period, particularly from 2012 to 2017. In HES records for 2002,
192    the age-standardised incidence was 0.29 (0.25 to 0.32) per 1,000 PYs among males and
193    0.25 (0.22 to 0.28) per 1,000 PYs among females. By 2017, this had increased to 2.52 (2.35
194    to 2.68) per 1,000 PYs among males and 2.10 (1.96 to 2.23) per 1,000 PYs among females.
195    In contrast to primary care and hospital records, there was no consistent trend in sepsis
196    recording as a cause of death during the study period. In 2002 sepsis mortality was 0.34
197    (0.31 to 0.38) per 1,000 PYs among males and 0.28 (0.26 to 0.31) per 1,000 PYs among
198    females. By 2017, this had risen to 0.42 (0.35 to 0.49) per 1,000 PYs among males and 0.30
199    (0.25 to 0.35) per 1,000 PYs among females although the highest peak in mortality rate was
200    in 2006 for females and 2007 for males. Supplementary Figure 1 shows equivalent age-
201    standardised rates when first sepsis records in each calendar year are included, rather than
202    only the first in the study period.
203
204
205    Concurrent recording of sepsis events across data sources
206
207    There were 4,117 (20%) first HES sepsis events and 2,438 (17%) mortality records that
208    were concurrent with incident primary care sepsis records, based on a 30-day time-window
209    (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Among the 13,972 deceased patients with sepsis
210    listed as any cause of death, 2,438 (17%) had an incident sepsis event recorded in primary
211    care EHRs and 3,397 (24%) had incident sepsis events recorded in HES in the same period.
212    Only 614 patients had index sepsis events recorded across all three data sources within 30
                                                                                                                                   9

213    days of the date of event or date of death. We evaluated whether extending the time-window
214    influenced conclusions. Including both first and subsequent sepsis records and a 90-day
215    time window gave 4,770 (24%) HES records and 2,635 (19%) of mortality records
216    concurrent with an incident primary care sepsis record. (Supplementary Table 1 and
217    Supplementary Figures 3 and 4).
218    Logistic regression analysis of variables associated with concurrent recording in more than
219    one data source for patients with sepsis found that among patients with sepsis events
220    recorded in primary care, concurrent HES records of sepsis within 30 days before or after
221    first diagnosis were higher at younger or older ages and for patients with the most recent
222    period of diagnosis (Figure 3). For index sepsis events recorded in HES, concurrent
223    recording in primary care EHRs was not consistently associated with age, deprivation nor
224    period. Among patients with sepsis events recorded in ONS, there were lower odds of a
225    concurrent CPRD record of sepsis for the age range 35 to 54 years, being registered with a
226    practice in the least deprived quintiles and the most recent period of diagnosis (Figure 4).
227
228    3.4 Incidence of sepsis from linked data sources
229    Table 3 shows age-specific sepsis incidence rate per 1,000 patient-years from primary care
230    EHRs and for primary care EHRs combined with HES and ONS, stratified. With primary care
231    EHRs alone, sepsis incidence rates increased from 0.19 in males and 0.20 in females per
232    1,000 PY under five years of age, to 5.22 in males and 3.55 in females at 85 years and
233    older. Estimated incidence rates were substantially higher when either HES or mortality
234    records were included. When all three data sources were combined the incidence of sepsis
235    was 0.32 per 1,000 PY in males and 0.36 per 1,000 PY in females under five years
236    increasing to 10.09 per 1,000 PY in males and 7.22 per 1,000 PY in females at age 85 years
237    and older. Supplementary Figure 2 shows equivalent age-specific incidence when first
238    sepsis records in each calendar year, rather than the first in the study period, were included.

240    Discussion
241
242    Summary of results
243    This study evaluated sepsis recording in primary care electronic records, hospital episodes
244    and mortality records for a large population registered with general practices in England. We
245    found that, over a 16-year period, a similar number of incident sepsis events were recorded
246    in primary care and hospital records, However, a high proportion of these records were not
247    concurrent across data sources: the majority of sepsis events recorded in primary care were
248    not recorded in hospital episodes, and the majority of hospital episodes were not recorded in
249    primary care. This conclusion held even when events were evaluated over a longer time-
250    window or if recurrent as well as incident events were included. There were a smaller
251    number of records of sepsis from mortality registration but a majority of these were not
252    associated with concurrent primary care or hospital records for sepsis. Analyses of
253    associations between concurrent recording between sources and available patient
254    covariates were not consistent across linkages, suggesting that coding variations were
255    largely unexplained. Estimates for age-specific incidence rates may be up to twice as high if
256    linked data sources are employed.
257
258    Interpretation
259
260    Current estimates suggest that about 50-70% of all sepsis events are community-acquired
261    [24, 25]. Clinical guidelines recommend that patients with suspected sepsis should be
262    referred for management in hospital, which suggests that most patients seen in primary care
263    may be admitted to hospital [1]. However, some patients with sepsis may access hospital
264    services directly without first presenting in primary care. Investigations in hospital may
265    identify underlying causes for sepsis, which might be coded as the reason for admission.
266    Just under half of severe sepsis cases admitted to intensive care in England and Wales are
                                                                                                                                  11

267    associated with a fatal outcome [26]. It may be expected that a sepsis diagnosis will be
268    communicated to the patient’s general practice or, in the event of a fatal outcome, recorded
269    into mortality records. Our results indicate that the process of recording sepsis episodes
270    across different health information systems is highly inconsistent. Health professionals may
271    make varying use of the concept of sepsis in the clinical recording of patients’ conditions.
272    ‘Sepsis’ may sometimes form an element of the clinical narrative but, on other occasions, an
273    underlying cause may be given greater prominence, as in the COVID-19 pandemic. The
274    NHS in England produced a cross-sectoral plan to improve outcomes for patients with sepsis
275    [27]. This aimed to improve training between different healthcare professional groups and
276    reduce differences in coding practices between organisations. A National Early Warning
277    Score (NEWS) has been rolled out to improve early recognition of signs of sepsis but this
278    has been accompanied by concerns for false positive alerts and possible over-diagnosis of
279    sepsis [28].
280
281    Limitations
282    The present results derive from a large, representative population. However, a disadvantage
283    of using linked, rather than stand-alone CPRD records is that linkage eligibility restrictions
284    reduces the sample size and possibly representativeness. GPs must be eligible for linkage
285    which requires meeting standards of data completeness, thus biasing the practices within
286    the linked sample toward those that record disease events with greater accuracy. It is also
287    possible that there are some inaccuracies with linkage across sources. Discrepancies
288    between CPRD GOLD and the ONS death data have been highlighted, particularly in the
289    years prior to 2013 [29]. This study does not differentiate between community-acquired and
290    hospital-acquired sepsis. Further research is required to understand how sepsis incidence in
291    the combined sources can reveal more about the impact of antimicrobial stewardship
292    strategies.

293
294    Findings in relation to other studies
295    This study is broadly consistent with the growing body of literature that advocates the use of
296    linked data sources [13-16]. However, it also indicates that stand-alone CPRD data may
297    provide accurate estimates of changes in the burden of sepsis. Millet et al. (2016) found that
298    population-averaged community-acquired pneumonia incidence was 39% higher using the
299    linked data than stand-alone data [16]. It may be that increased awareness and
300    standardisation of detection and recording have prevented such discrepancies being
301    observed for sepsis.
302
303    Conclusion
304    Analysing linked data enhances the completeness of ascertainment of health events across
305    health service sectors and population health registries particularly for age-groups at highest
306    risk. Further standardisation of coding practices across linked sources in addition to more
307    timely and accurate recording of secondary care and mortality events in GP records would
308    help to improve comparability. Further research is required to investigate the reasons for any
309    divergent trends across the data sources and to differentiate trends in community-acquired
310    versus hospital-acquired sepsis.
