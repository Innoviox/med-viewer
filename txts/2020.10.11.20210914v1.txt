    Abstract:
    Objective: Attentional function deficits secondary to degeneration of brain cholinergic systems
    are significant contributors to gait-balance deficits in Parkinson disease (PD). To assess whether
    α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) stimulation improves attention and gait-balance
    function, we performed a target engagement study of the α4β2* nAChR partial agonist
    varenicline.
    Methods:           Non-demented PD participants with cholinergic deficits were identified with
    [18F]fluoroethoxybenzamicol positron emission tomography (PET). α4β2* nAChR occupancy
    after subacute oral varenicline treatment was measured with [18F]flubatine PET. With a dose
    selected from the receptor occupancy experiment, varenicline effects on gait, balance, and
    cognition were assessed in a double-masked placebo-controlled crossover study.                                          Primary
    endpoints were normal pace gait speed and a measure of postural stability.
    Results: Varenicline, 0.25 mg per day, 0.25 mg b.i.d., 0.5 mg b.i.d., and 1.0 mg b.i.d., produced
    60% - 70% receptor occupancy, with 0.5 mg po b.i.d chosen for the crossover study. Thirty-
    three (of thirty-four) participants, completed the crossover study with excellent tolerability.
    Varenicline had no impact on the postural stability measure and resulted in slower normal pace
    gait speed. Varenicline reduced distraction effects under dual task gait conditions and improved
    performance on a sustained attention test. In 28 participants in whom treatment compliance was
    confirmed by plasma varenicline measurements, we obtained identical conclusions.
    Interpretation: Varenicline occupied a significant fraction of α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine
    receptors, was tolerated well, enhanced attentional function, and improved dual task gait

    performance. α4β2* nicotinic agonists may be useful in mitigating gait and balance disorders in
    PD.
    Introduction:
    Dopamine replacement therapy (DRT)-refractory gait and balance disorders are among the most
    morbid aspects of Parkinson disease (PD).                          Gait deficits, including postural instability and
    freezing, worsen with disease progression and substantially increase fall risk.                                    Falls are a
    significant source of morbidity in PD patients, with a relatively high rate of serious falls leading
    to fractures and hospitalizations, precipitation of nursing home placement, and increased
    mortality associated with falls.1,2,3,4
    The DRT-refractory nature of gait and postural deficits in PD indicates involvement of non-
    dopaminergic systems. Considerable evidence suggests that DRT-resistant gait and balance
    disorders are associated with degeneration of central nervous system (CNS) cholinergic
    projection systems.5-13                Fall risk in PD is likely increased by the conjunction of striatal
    dopaminergic denervation and degeneration of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain
    corticopetal complex (BFCC) and pedunculopontine-laterodorsal tegmental complex (PPN-
    LDT). The best defined role of the BFCC is in attention with suggestions that PPN-LDT
    cholinergic neurons play a role in alertness.12,14,15 Preclinical model experiments indicate that an
    intact BFCC system can compensate for motor deficits secondary to striatal dopaminergic
    denervation. As BFCC neurons are lost, gait-balance dysfunction may increase markedly as
    BFCC cholinergic deficits unmask the full impacts of striatal dopaminergic deficits.12,16 This
    model is consistent with results of dual task paradigm experiments, in PD and control

    participants, indicating that impaired attention is associated with worsening gait-balance
    functions and increased fall risk.17
    Cholinergic neurotransmission is mediated by both G-protein coupled receptors and ionotropic
    nicotinic receptors (nAChRs). The predominant CNS nicotinic receptor is the α4β2* (*potential
    other subunits) nAChR.18 Stimulation of cortical α4β2* receptors plays an important role in
    attention.12 This is likely the mechanism by which nicotine enhances attention. In the setting of
    BFCC projection degeneration, pharmacologic stimulation of α4β2* nAChRs might improve
    attention and mitigate gait-balance deficits.
    Varenicline (VCN) is a potent (Ki = 0.4 nM) α4β2* nAChR partial agonist (efficacy = 45%) used
    widely for tobacco abuse cessation.19,20 VCN has an excellent safety record and favorable
    pharmacokinetic features.20-24 To explore the potential of VCN to improve DRT-resistant gait-
    balance deficits, we performed a target engagement study of VCN in PD participants with
    neocortical cholinergic deficits. We assessed target engagement along 2 dimensions; VCN
    binding to brain α4β2* nAChRs, and VCN effects on laboratory-based measures of gait, balance,
    and cognitive functions.
    Another goal was to explore measures for assessing target engagement. While there is abundant
    literature characterizing gait, balance, and fall risk in PD and in normal aging, there are no
    laboratory-based measures predicting intervention outcomes. In the absence of measures with
    predictive validity, measures linked to pathophysiologic mechanisms are more likely to be
    adequate indices of target engagement. We studied both conventional gait-balance and cognitive
    outcome measures, and measures more specifically linked to disrupted attentional and
    cholinergic functions.

    Materials and Methods:
    Regulatory Compliance: Informed consent was obtained from all participants according to
    the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was approved by the University of Michigan Medical
    School Institutional Review Board.                        An Investigational New Drug application waiver for
    varenicline study was obtained from the Food & Drug Administration. This study was registered
    at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04403399, NCT02933372).
    Participant Selection: PD participants were recruited from a larger cohort characterized with
    [18F]fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol positron emission tomography ([18F]FEOBV PET).9                                                The
    vesicular acetylcholine transporter ligand [18F]FEOBV was used to determine the magnitudes of
    cortical cholinergic terminal deficits.                    All participants met the International Parkinson and
    Movement           Disorder Society clinical diagnostic                      criteria      for PD.          All underwent
    [11C]dihydrotetrabenazine PET to confirm the presence of nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminal
    deficits.      No enrolled participant was dementia or was using drugs or supplements with
    cholinergic properties, or using tobacco products. Because of anecdotal reports of worsening
    mood disorders, adverse ethanol interactions, and myocardial infarctions, we excluded
    individuals with an active mood disorder (Geriatic Depression Scale >5 and evidence of recent,
    worsening mood), alcohol use disorder (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test score >7 for
    those over 65 years; >8 for those 65 years and younger), and active cardiovascular disease.
    Participants were counseled to avoid alcoholic beverages during study participation.                                         Only
    participants with cortical cholinergic deficits were enrolled. In PD, the occipital cortex has
    highest vulnerability for cholinergic transporter losses compared to other brain regions.25
    Hypocholinergic status was defined as falling within the lower tertile of occipital cortical
    [18F]FEOBV binding in normal older adults. Participants were maintained on stable DRT

    regimens throughout these experiments. To ensure that there was not a marked difference
    between VCN interaction with α4β2* nAChRs in PD participant and control brains, we
    performed a more limited dose-response experiment in normal participants.                                       Age-matched
    control participants without clinical evidence of parkinsonism or other neurologic disorders, and
    not using any cholinergic agents or tobacco products, were studied.
    VCN Occupancy of α4β2* nAChRs Study: VCN occupancy of α4β2* nAChRs was
    assessed with ascending doses of VCN and the selective α4β2* nAChR PET ligand
    [18F]Flubatine.26 Participants were treated with oral VCN for 10 days with ascending dose
    schedules. Higher dosing cohorts were begun after the previous dosing cohort completed its
    scheduled treatment and follow-up. Doses chosen were 0.25 mg per day, 0.25 mg b.i.d., 0.5 mg
    b.i.d., and 1.0 mg b.i.d. The clinically used VCN dose is 1.0 mg b.i.d. Participants received an
    initial 0.25 mg dose following confirmation of eligibility and baseline evaluations and were
    monitored for 4 hours. In participants scheduled for higher VCN doses, the total daily dose was
    escalated over the next 2 days, followed by 8 days of stable daily VCN dose. α4β2* nAChR
    agonists may induce nAChR expression.27 The conventional strategy of imaging participants
    before and at the end of a drug exposure period might result in underestimation of receptor
    occupancy. Consequently, we imaged participants at the end of their drug exposure periods and
    again after 5 days (~5 half-lives) of washout from drug exposure.                                       [18F]Flubatine was
    synthesized as described previously.28 Participants were scanned on a Biograph TruePoint
    Model 1094, using a dynamic acquisition of 18 frames over 90 minutes (four x 0.5 min; three x 1
    min; two x 2.5 min; two x 5 min; seven x 10 min). α4β2* nAChRs occupancy was estimated by
    comparing [18F]Flubatine standardized uptake values (SUVs) on and off VCN. SUVs were
    calculated as (B-D)/(B-ND), where B is the SUV of the “baseline” scan (off VCN), and D is the

    SUV of the “drug” scan (on VCN), and ND is estimated of the non-displaceable SUV. ND is
    calculated from the x-intercept of a regression of (B-D) on D.
    Crossover Study: Following selection of a study dose from the α4β2* nAChR occupancy
    experiment (Results below), we completed a double-masked, placebo-controlled crossover study
    to assess VCN effects on measures of gait, balance, and cognition (Figure 1). Participants
    completing the initial receptor occupancy study were eligible to enroll in this experiment.
    Participants were randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment sequences: placebo followed by VCN
    0.5 mg b.i.d., or VCN followed by placebo. A statistician prepared the randomization list using
    permuted blocks with random block sizes. The list with randomization number and treatment
    allocation was sent to the research pharmacy and a blinded list of randomization numbers was
    sent to the study coordinator. After patient consent was completed and eligibility confirmed, the
    coordinator assigned the next randomization number to the participant, and sent a prescription
    with participant ID and randomization number to the research pharmacist who dispensed the
    appropriate study medication. To mask drug, VCN pills or placebo were encapsulated in gelatin
    sheaths. Participants received an initial 0.25 mg dose or equivalent placebo following baseline
    evaluations and were monitored for 4 hours after initial study medication administration with
    total daily dose or equivalent placebo escalated over the next 2 days. Treatment periods were 3
    weeks in duration and interrupted by a 3 week washout period. Participants underwent a
    standard evaluation at baseline, at the end of the first treatment period, at end of the washout
    period-beginning of the second treatment period, and at the end of the second treatment period
    (Figure 1). Outcome measures at the end of the VCN and placebo treatment periods were
    compared to assess VCN effects. The standard evaluation was a battery of motor, cognitive, and
    behavioral measures (see below). We a priori selected a measure of gait performance, normal

    pace gait speed, and a measure of postural stability, Mancini et al.’s JERK, as co-primary
    endpoints.29,30 JERK is the time based derivative of lower trunk accelerations during standing
    spontaneous sway. JERK was chosen because it tracks postural instability in PD.30 Normal pace
    gait speed was chosen as prior studies indicated that neocortical cholinergic denervation is
    associated with slower gait speed in PD.8 We hypothesized that VCN treated participants would
    ambulate faster and that VCN treatment would reduce JERK. Gait analysis was performed on an
    8 meter GAITRite pressure sensitive walkway (CIR Systems, Inc.) and standard parameters were
    analyzed using ProtoKinetics Movement Analysis Software (GAITRite version 5.09C;
    ProtoKinetics, LLC). Gait assessments were repeated with a dual-task protocol in which
    participants counted backwards by three starting at a random number (under 100) provided by
    the examiner. Postural stability was assessed with the Ambulatory Parkinson's Disease
    Monitoring (APDM) wearable sensor system (APDM Wearable Technologies, Inc.) using the
    iSWAY protocol, with participants standing on a foam pad with eyes open and eyes closed.
    Standard postural measures, including JERK, were assessed and calculated using the
    manufacturer’s software (Mobility Lab Version 1). We used the APDM system’s iTUG (Timed
    Up and Go) protocol to collect additional exploratory data. For cognition, we used a general
    cognitive measure, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and selected tests to examine
    major cognitive domains but focusing on attention and executive function.
    Motor Assessments: Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale,
    part III (MD-UPDRSIII; “on” state); MDS-UPDRSIII postural instability and gait subscore
    (PIGD) subscale score (sum of items 3.1, 3.9-3.13); Gait Speed (normal pace); Gait Speed (fast

    effects of attentional loading, normal pace and fast pace gait were performed under dual task
    conditions. Dual task conditions typically lead to slower gait speed. Differences in gait speed
    between dual task and no dual task conditions are a measure of the attentional burden imposed
    by the dual task. To assess the effects of VCN on this aspect of gait performance, we compared
    the differences between no dual task and dual task gait speed between VCN and placebo
    treatment periods.
    Cognitive Assessments: MoCA; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III Digit Symbol modalities
    test; California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) short term memory test; CVLT long term memory
    test; CVLT recognition test; Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Stroop III; D-
    KEFS sorting total; D-KEFS verbal fluency letters total; D-KEFS verbal fluency animals; D-
    KEFS Trail Making Test 4; Judgment of Line Orientation (JOLO) test. We assessed attentional
    function with a Sustained Attention Test (SAT), established to reflect CNS cholinergic systems
    function in humans (Lustig et al., 2013; Berry et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2017).31,32,33 The SAT is
    performed with 2 conditions; without and with a distractor (dSAT). SAT and dSAT results are
    reported as the vigilance index, a measure that corrects estimates of accurate detection with
    penalties for false detections and not confounded by errors of omission.34
    Behavioral Assessments: Geriatric Depression Score (GDS) and Columbia-Suicide Severity
    Rating Scale (C-SSRS).
    Treatment Compliance Monitoring: To assess compliance, we measured plasma VCN levels

    accuracy and precision were evaluated at 5 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, and 200 ng/ml (N=3). Accuracy
    was 106% or less and precision was 10% relative standard deviation or less.
    Statistical Plan: The sample size (planned initially at four participants per dosing group) for the
    VCN-α4β2* nAChR occupancy study was based on logistical considerations. For the Crossover
    study, we calculated that 33 participants would provide at least 80% power to detect within-
    patient treatment differences of 0.122 m/s in gait speed and -0.131 m2/s5 for JERK, assuming
    within-participant correlation of > 0.64 and > 0.72, respectively, using a paired t-test and a two-
    sided Type I error of 0.025 (Bonferoni adjustment for co-primary endpoints). This approach is
    conservative given our analysis method uses mixed effects models. Estimates for treatment
    differences were based on Bohnen et al. for normal pace gait speed and Mancini et al. for
    JERK.8,29
    We conducted exploratory analyses to examine the distributions of outcomes under each
    treatment, as well as individual and mean profiles over time. Graphical approaches such as
    boxplots and scatterplots with linear or non-linear (e.g., loess) methods were used, allowing
    identification of outliers, linearity, and correlation of measurements within participant and across
    time. Log transformations were applied when outcome data did not appear normally distributed.
    Descriptive statistics for efficacy and safety outcomes were provided for each dosing cohort in
    the VCN-α4β2* nAChR occupancy study.                               For the Crossover study, linear mixed models
    containing treatment sequence, treatment period, treatment group, and dependent-variable
    baseline value, with participant within treatment sequence as a random effect, were used for
    analysis of continuous outcomes. To compare differences between VCN and placebo, a test for

    carryover based on the sequence effect was conducted using patient with sequence as the error
    term. Results are presented as least squares (LS) mean and standard error (SE). The co-primary
    endpoints were tested at the 2-sided, 0.025, significance level. All other tests were based on a 2-
    sided significance level of 0.05; no adjustments for additional multiple comparisons.
    Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed in all randomized participants
    (intention-to-treat [ITT] population). Secondary continuous endpoints were analyzed similarly
    to the primary endpoints. Categorical analyses were based on Gart’s test.35
    Safety endpoints were analyzed in all randomized participants who received at least one dose of
    study medication. We included adverse events that occurred in the washout period with the
    treatment given in period One.
    Results:
    Participants: Characteristics of the fifteen PD participants enrolled for the initial VCN-α4β2*
    nAChR occupancy study are described in Table 1a. Ten participants completed this phase of the
    study; two participants received 0.25 mg VCN per day, three participants 0.25 mg bid VCN per
    day, three participants 0.5 mg bid per day, and two participants 1.0 mg bid per day. To confirm
    that α4β2* nAChR – VCN interactions were not grossly different in PD compared to normal
    brain, an additional ten control participants were studied with ascending doses of VCN and
    [18F]Flubatine PET in a protocol identical to that used for PD. Data from one control participant
    were excluded because of suspected covert tobacco abuse. Four participants received 0.25 mg
    per day, two participants 0.25 mg po b.i.d. per day, and three participants 0.5 mg b.i.d. per day.
    Characteristics of participants for the VCN-α4β2* nAChR occupancy studies are described in
    Table 1a. Characteristics for the Crossover study participants are shown in Table 1b.

    VCN-α4β2* nAChR occupancy study:                                   VCN displacement of thalamic [18F]Flubatine
    binding to α4β2* nAChRs is reported, the region with the highest [18F]Flubatine binding (Figure
    2). Analysis of other regions gave very similar results (data not shown). The lowest daily dose
    of VCN, 0.25 mg per day, produced significant receptor occupancy. There was little evidence of
    a dose-response relationship with all VCN doses producing 60-70% occupancy of α4β2*
    nAChRs. Results in control participants were very similar (data not shown). As 0.5 mg p.o.
    b.i.d. produced approximately the same α4β2* nAChR occupancy as 1.0 mg p.o. b.i.d., 0.5 mg
    p.o. b.i.d. was chosen as the dose for the Crossover study.
    Crossover Study:
    Intention-to-Treat and Treatment Compliant Participants Analyses: The primary analyses
    of the Crossover study used the ITT population. Secondary analyses were conducted using
    identical statistical methods in participants who were compliant with study treatment. We
    excluded participants without evidence of significant increases in VCN plasma levels between
    placebo and VCN treatment periods to define the treatment compliant participants. Safety
    analyses are based on all participants.
    Safety: We enrolled 34 PD participants. There was 1 drop-out for reasons unrelated to the study
    (withdrawn 4 days into period 2 while on VCN). Among the 34 participants, there were 56
    adverse events (serious and non-serious) in 22 (65%) participants (Table 2). There were more
    adverse events in the VCN periods than placebo periods: 17 participants on VCN experienced
    35 AEs, while 8 participants on placebo experienced 18 AEs. These were largely expected
    adverse events such as nausea and insomnia. There were 2 serious adverse events; one in each
    treatment period and neither related to VCN treatment.                                Two participants required dose
    reductions to 0.5 mg p.o. per day and 1 participant to 0.25 p.o. mg per day – 0.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.

    for study completion.                   As the VCN-α4β2* nAChR occupancy experiment demonstrated
    substantial nAChR occupancy at the lowest VCN dose, these participants are included in all
    analyses.
    Motor Function Measures – ITT Population: Of the primary outcome measures, there was no
    statistically significant difference in JERK performance between VCN and placebo treatment
    periods (Table 3). For normal pace gait speed, VCN treatment was associated with statistically
    significant gait slowing, a result opposite to the hypothesized effect (Table 3). Analysis of
    secondary/exploratory measures returned disparate results. MDS-UPDRSIII scores modestly
    worsened during the VCN treatment periods (Table 3). The PIGD subscore was not different
    between VCN and placebo periods. Other postural stability measures - mean sway velocity and
    RMS, were not different between placebo and VCN treatment periods. VCN significantly
    reduced the difference in normal pace gait speed between no dual task and dual task conditions.
    VCN treatment had no effect on gait speed under fast pace conditions. There was no effect on
    the difference between fast pace gait speed under dual task and no dual task conditions. VCN
    treatment had significant and predictable effects on normal pace cadence, stride length, and
    stride time. Consistent with lack of VCN effect on gait speed under the fast pace condition, there
    was no effect on fast pace cadence, stride length, or stride time. iTUG measures showed little
    VCN effect (data not shown).
    Cognitive Measures – ITT Population: The SAT, a measure of attentional function that
    reflects CNS cholinergic functions, showed positive effects of VCN treatment (Table 4). There
    was little effect of VCN on dSAT performance, which was poor in both VCN treatment and
    placebo periods. Neither the MoCA, nor any conventional domain specific measures showed
    effects of VCN treatment (Table 4).

    Behavioral Measures – ITT Population: VCN treatment had no effects on GDS (Table 4) or
    C-SSRS scores (data not shown).
    Analysis of Treatment Compliant Population: We excluded the participant who dropped out
    prior to study completion.                    Four participants exhibited VCN levels below the level of
    quantification at the end of both treatment periods, suggesting non-compliance. All analyses of
    motor, cognitive, and behavioral measures were repeated for the 28 compliant participants
    (Tables 5 and 6). Results were essentially identical to those of the ITT population. For the
    primary endpoints, VCN was associated with slower normal pace gait speed and no effect on
    JERK. VCN improved SAT performance. There was a similar reduction in the difference
    between dual task normal pace gait performance and no dual task normal pace gait performance
    in the compliant population, however, this was not statistically significant in this smaller sample
    (p=0.06; Table 5). The magnitude of the mean VCN effect on the difference between dual task
    normal pace gait speed and no dual task normal pace gait speed in the compliant population was
    very similar to that seen in the ITT population (Tables 3 & 5).
    VCN Levels:                At the end of the placebo period, VCN levels were below the level of
    quantification for all participants, and mean VCN levels were 13.94 ng/ml (SD 7.91) at the end
    of the varenicline treatment period. VCN concentrations at the end of the treatment period are
    consistent with previously reported pharmacokinetic data.22
    Discussion:
    We assessed target engagement in complementary experiments. In our dose-finding experiment,
    we employed [18F]flubatine PET to establish that relatively low daily VCN produces significant
    α4β2* nAChR occupancy. There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship, suggesting
    that low oral doses saturate α4β2* nAChRs. This inference is consistent with limited data

    suggesting that low oral VCN doses are effective for smoking cessation.36 We established that
    there is no gross difference in VCN-α4β2* nAChR interactions in PD and control CNS. Our
    normal control results are similar to those obtained by Lotfipour et al., who used [18F]2-fluoro-3-
    [2(S)-2-azetidinylmethoxy]pyridine PET to demonstrate high α4β2* nAChR occupancy in
    normal participants after a single, 0.5 mg, oral VCN dose.37 Our second experiment, using a
    daily dose based on receptor occupancy, was a placebo controlled, double-masked crossover
    study. VCN had no effect on our chosen measure of postural stability or other measures of
    postural stability studied.                VCN was associated with slower normal pace gait speed and
    significantly narrowed the difference between normal pace gait speed under baseline and
    distracting dual task conditions. VCN had a positive effect on SAT performance, an attention
    measure directly linked to CNS cholinergic functions, but little effect on conventional cognitive
    measures. Results were almost identical in analyses of ITT and treatment compliant participants.
    VCN narrowing of differences in dual task normal pace gait speed and no dual task normal pace
    gait speed was not statistically significant in the compliant population, likely reflecting the
    reduced sample size of the compliant population. The mean magnitude of VCN effects on the
    difference between dual task and no dual task gait speed was essentially identical between the
    ITT and compliant populations.
    Our results are similar to those of Hall et al., who randomized 36 PD participants to VCN, 1 mg
    p.o. b.i.d., or placebo for an 8 week trial period.37 Participants were slightly older than our
    participants but comparable in PD severity and cognitive status. Their primary outcome measure
    was Berg Balance Scale (BBS) performance. Cognitive effects of VCN were assessed with the
    Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). There was
    no VCN effect on any of these measures. There are important methodological differences

    between this study and our work. Cholinergic systems are intact in many moderately advanced
    PD participants.7,9 It is likely that Hall et al. enrolled some participants with normal cholinergic
    systems. We enrolled participants with cortical cholinergic deficits. This difference may be
    particularly important in the context of a partial agonist. In the presence of normal levels of
    endogenous agonists, partial agonists exhibit antagonist properties, potentially impairing
    cholinergic signaling. Perhaps most important is the difference in outcome measures. The BBS
    does not contain a dual task component. The 6 item FAB contains 2 items (4 and 5) with
    attentional components, but there was no measure comparable to the SAT, a specific measure of
    attention reflecting cholinergic functions.
    Disruption of attentional functions subserved by CNS cholinergic systems is likely a mechanism
    mediating the effects of cholinergic system deficits on gait and balance functions. Cortical
    α4β2* nAChR activation is a key modulator of attentional function, leading to the hypothesis
    that VCN would improve gait and postural control. One of our primary end points, normal pace
    gait speed, was chosen on the basis of prior data indicating that gait speed was related to cortical
    cholinergic deficits.8 The second primary endpoint, JERK, was chosen as a measure of postural
    control on the basis of prior data indicating that it differentiated PD participants from controls
    and tracked disease progression in PD.29,30 Prior studies did not, however, specifically link
    JERK changes to CNS cholinergic deficits.
    In terms of the selected primary endpoints, we found no effect on the measure of postural
    stability, JERK. We documented a significant effect on normal pace gait speed, but opposite to
    our hypothesis that nAChR stimulation would increase normal pace gait speed. It is plausible,
    however, that slower normal pace gait speed associated with VCN treatment might reflect greater
    attentiveness. In a rat model of variations in BFCC function, animals with better attentional

    capacity secondary to more robust BFCC function were more cautious during performance of an
    attentionally demanding gait task under single task conditions and less likely to fall under
    distracting conditions.39 An outcome measure specifically focused on gait performance in the
    context of attentional function – the difference between normal pace gait speed at baseline and
    with a dual task distractor – showed a positive effect of VCN treatment. Similarly, Kucinski et
    al. showed that gait performance (less vulnerability to falls) was better for high-attention
    capacity animals.39 While there were no discernable effects of VCN on conventional measures
    of cognitive function, SAT performance, which is known to reflect CNS cholinergic dysfunction
    in humans, including PD participants, showed a positive VCN effect. Using the same model as
    the Kucinski et al., Paolone et al. demonstrated better SAT performance in animals with better
    BFCC function, and linked superior performance directly to α4β2* nAChR stimulation.40 Our
    results are consistent also with those of Mocking et al., who showed that subacute oral VCN
    administration (0.5 mg/day for 3 days; then 1.0 mg/day for 4 days) in healthy participants
    improved working and declarative memory.41 Coupled with our [18F]flubatine PET data, we
    suggest that VCN narrowing of the difference between normal pace gait speed under baseline
    and distracting conditions, and the SAT results, constitute clinical evidence of target
    engagement.
    We did not find any VCN effects under fast pace gait conditions. This may be because fast pace
    gait involves conscious focus on gait performance, strengthening attentional functions.
    Similarly, we did not find any VCN effect on dSAT performance, possibly due to floor effects.
    We did not find any effects on other postural control measures, mean sway velocity and RMS,
    studied. None of the postural control measures studied have been directly linked to attentional
    functions or cholinergic deficits and may not be appropriate outcome measures for interventions

    aimed at improving attentional functions. We did note a rise in MDS-UPDRSIII scores with
    VCN treatment. The magnitude of this effect was modest, almost 3 points, and below the
    threshold of a minimally clinically important worsening in MDS-UPDRSIII scores.42
    Our results highlight some of the difficulties involved with assessing interventions for DRT-
    refractory gait and balance disorders. Similar to the results of Hall et al., VCN did not have
    effects on conventional endpoints. We did find positive effects of VCN treatment on dual task
    normal pace gait performance and the SAT, measures that arguably more closely reflect the
    cholinergic system – attentional deficits that are likely major contributors to DRT-refractory gait
    and balance disorders. Targeting α4β2* nAChRs may be a viable approach to mitigating this
    morbid PD feature. We suggest also that pursuing receptor subtype pharmacology, either for
    nAChRs or muscarinic cholinergic receptors, is more likely to be useful than non-specific
    approaches such as use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.43
    Future intervention studies for DRT-refractory gait-balance disorders will likely require
    laboratory-based measures that are both proxy measures of fall risk and permit efficient
    evaluation of target engagement. Our experience suggests that outcome measures tied closely to
    underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms will be more robust biomarkers of target engagement.

      8 non-serious AEs occurred during washout, 6 in the placebo then varenicline arm and 2 in the varenicline then
    placebo arm; AEs during washout are categorized to the treatment in period 1 in this table; one subject randomized
    to varenicline then placebo had an unknown date of onset and thus is not included in this table (but their non-serious
    AE is included in summaries in the text).
