14     Abstract
15     Near fibre electromyography (NFEMG) is the use of specifically high-pass filtered motor unit potential
16     (MUPs) (i.e. near fibre MUPs (NFMs)) extracted from needle-detected EMG signals for the examination of
17     changes in motor unit (MU) morphology and electrophysiology caused by neuromuscular disorders or
18     ageing. The concepts of NFEMG, the parameters used, including NFM duration and dispersion, which
19     relates to fibre diameter variability and/or endplate scatter, and a new measure of neuromuscular
20     junction transmission (NMJ) instability, NFM segment jitter, and the methods for obtaining their values
21     are explained. Evaluations using simulated needle-detected EMG data and exemplary human data are
22     presented, described and discussed. The data presented demonstrate the ability of using NFEMG
23     parameters to detect changes in MU fibre diameter variability, end plate scatter, and neuromuscular
24     transmission time variability. These changes can be detected prior to alterations of MU size, numbers or
25     muscle recruitment patterns.
26     1.0 Introduction
27     A motor unit (MU) is comprised of a somatic motor neuron (MN), its axon and distal axonal branches,
28     neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and associated skeletal muscle fibres. Neuromuscular disorders can
29     affect somatic MNs, their axons, axonal branches, NMJs and/or associated muscle fibres. Anatomically
30     neuromuscular disorders can cause loss of somatic MNs, axonal demyelination, and MU remodelling; fibre
31     denervation and the sprouting of new axonal branches and the formation of new NMJs, acting to minimise
32     muscle fibre loss; and fibre atrophy and/or hypertrophy. Electrophysiologically, neuromuscular disorders
                                                                                                                                                 1

33     can cause NMJ transmission delay, increased NMJ transmission time variability and/or NMJ transmission
34     failure (Daube 2000). An effective way of detecting the anatomical and electrophysiological effects of a
35     neuromuscular disorder, and therefore its presence and extent, is to examine electrical signals generated
36     by nerves and muscles. With respect to an affected muscle, these anatomical and electrophysiological
37     alterations can be inferred by characterizing its electrophysiology via the detection and analysis of
38     electromyographic signals.
39     The discharge/activation of a MN creates a trans-axolemmal or axonal action potential (AAP), which
40     propagates along its axon and each axonal branch to initiate neuromuscular transmission to its associated
41     muscle fibre. Successful neuromuscular transmission results in the generation of propagating trans-
42     sarcolemmal or muscle fibre action potentials (MFAPs) and coordinated contraction of the sarcomeres of
43     the associated muscle fibre. As such, the MU is the fundamental element of muscle force generation
44     (Heckman and Enoka 2012).
45     Extracellular electrodes placed in or on a skeletal muscle can detect the time changing electric potentials
46     created by the propagating MFAPs of a MU. The time changing electric potential created by the
47     propagating MFAPs of a single muscle fibre can be considered a muscle fibre potential (MFP) while the
48     summation of the MFPs created by the fibres of a MU is called a motor unit potential (MUP). For a healthy
49     MU, each discharge of a MN will result in the generation of a MFAP in each fibre of the MU. As such,
50     MUPs represent the summation of the MFPs of all of the MU fibres.
51     During the activation of a healthy muscle, populations of MUs are recruited and independently discharge
52     at pseudo-regular firing times to generate a desired level of muscle force. With simple level or window
53     triggering or more sophisticated pattern recognition methods, MUP trains (MUPTs) (i.e. sets of
54     consecutively detected MUPs generated by the same MU) can be extracted from a recorded EMG signal.
55     The number of trains extracted can be indicative of the level of MU recruitment. The occurrence times of
56     the MUPs within MUPTs can be indicative of MU discharge patterns. Both of these are related to a
57     combination of muscle anatomy and electrophysiology. For known levels of activation, the number of
58     MUs recruited, their discharge patterns and anatomical characteristics can be used to infer the presence
59     and extent of a neuromuscular disorder.
60     MU recruitment and firing patterns can be used to infer the relative numbers and sizes of MUs in a muscle
61     (Sonoo 2002). A typical MUP within a train or a calculated MUP template can be used to infer MU
62     anatomical features, such as size and the extent of terminal axonal branching. MUP shape instability
63     within a train can be used to infer electrophysiological features, such as terminal AAP and/or MFAP
                                                                                                                                           2

64     conduction velocity variability in combination with NMJ transmission time variability. NMJ transmission
65     time variability is often much greater than AAP and/or MFAP conduction velocity variability and therefore
66     greater MUP instability largely reflects NMJ transmission time variability.
67     More specifically, standard clinical EMG examinations are now, almost exclusively, based on signals
68     detected using concentric needle electrodes. During low-level muscle activation, MUPTs are extracted
69     using triggering or pattern recognition techniques. MU recruitment is qualitatively –i.e. subjectively-
70     assessed at increasing levels of force, whereas discharge patterns are usually not considered. A
71     representative or template MUP is used to infer MU size based on MUP duration, amplitude and/or area.
72     Increased MUP size is expected to be related to axonal sprouting which is in turn related to re-innervation
73     of denervated muscle fibres and indicative of MN loss. Reduced MUP size is expected to be related to
74     fibre loss, atrophy or NMJ blocking. Axonal sprouting and fibre atrophy or hypertrophy are indirectly
75     assessed using the number of phases and/or the number of turns in the representative or template MUP.
76     The formation of new NMJs and NMJ transmission delay, NMJ transmission time variability and/or NMJ
77     transmission failure are assessed using either separate SFEMG examination techniques (which are more
78     accurate though time consuming) or using a triggering technique and high-pass filtered EMG signals at
79     low levels of contraction to evaluate MUP complexity and morphological instability (i.e. jiggle).
80     Specific aspects of neuromuscular disease could be better detected if signals better reflecting the
81     anatomical and electrophysiological effects of disease on individual muscle fibres could be assessed. In
82     general, it is not possible to detect only the MFP created by the MFAP of a single muscle fibre. However,
83     as the characteristics of a MFP generated by a muscle fibre are dependent on fibre diameter and its radial
84     distance to the electrode detection surface, as radial distance increases, the amplitude and high frequency
85     content of a detected MFP decreases. This means that MFP contributions to a MUP from distant fibres
86     will be of lower amplitude and have a greater proportion of lower frequency energy. Conversely, MFP
87     contributions from near fibres (NFs) will be of higher amplitude and have a greater proportion of higher
88     frequency energy. Electrodes with smaller detection surface area increase the disparity of the radial
89     distances across the fibres of MU and, for a given electrode position relative to the fibres of a MU, allow
90     some fibres to be effectively near the electrode and some to be distant. For a suitably positioned electrode
91     with small detection surface area, the number of muscle fibres with small radial distance (i.e. the number
92     of NFs) can be small and the detected MUP will be primarily composed of NF MFPs and significant NF MFP
93     contributions may be detected. As suggested by Payan (1978) the use of high-pass filtering enhances the
94     effects of radial distance, and in effect, for the same detection surface area, reduces the number of NFs
                                                                                                                                           3

 95     and increases the chance of detecting significant NF MFP contributions. This is essentially the basis of
 96     single-fibre electromyography (SFEMG) whether using a traditional single-fibre or concentric needle
 97     electrode (Sanders & Stålberg, 1996; Stålberg, 2012). Because of the enhancement of NF contributions
 98     relative to distant fibre contributions, a suitably high-pass filtered concentric-needle detected MUP is
 99     called a NF MUP (NFM).
100     Near fibre electromyography (NFEMG) is the study of NFMs for the assessment of the sprouting of new
101     unmyelinated axonal branches and the formation of new NMJs, NMJ transmission delay, NMJ
102     transmission time variability or NMJ transmission failure and muscle fibre loss, atrophy or hypertrophy.
103     Several previous studies (Allen et al. 2015; Hourigan et al. 2015; Piasecki et al. 2016b, 2016a, 2020; Power
104     et al. 2016; Gilmore et al. 2017; Estruch and Stashuk 2019; Estruch et al. 2019) have incorporated NFEMG
105     parameters to demonstrate the effects of specific diseases or ageing on individual MUs. The focus of this
106     paper is to utilise MUPs and NFMs extracted from simulated EMG signals and those obtained from human
107     muscles to explicitly describe and evaluate a range of NFEMG methods and parameters used to investigate
108     neuromuscular alterations, including a new measure of NMJ instability, NFM segment jitter. Methods for
109     MUPT extraction, high-pass filtering, MUP and NFM contamination reduction and parameter calculation
110     are outlined.
111     2.0 Methods
112     2.1 Generation of Simulated Motor Unit Data
113     A commercially available application for creating simulated needle-detected EMG signals was used to
114     create sets of signals detected using an electrode of known geometry and generated by MUs for which
115     the numbers of fibres, their sizes, and their radial positions and NMJ axial positions, relative to the
116     detection surface of the electrode, are known (Stålberg & Karlsson, 2001). The simulated EMG signals
117     used are simple compared to real EMG data, lacking external 50/60Hz noise and movement artifacts,
118     however they provide a basis from which useful evaluations of MUP/NFM parameters can be evaluated.
119     The simulation of an EMG signal starts by modelling MUs which comprise a muscle in which the signals
120     are detected. In this work, a muscle comprised of four MUs was modelled. For each MU, the number of
121     fibres, their fibre diameter and NMJ axial location distribution and their NMJ transmission time variability
122     (i.e. jitter), as well as the expected diameter of the MU territory was selected. Firing pattern characteristics
123     of each MU were also selected. To evaluate the separate effects of fibre diameter variability, end plate
124     scatter, MU remodelling and jitter on MUP and NFM template and instability parameter values, specific
125     muscle/EMG detection scenarios were modelled. Except for specific changes related to the scenarios
                                                                                                                                            4

126     described below, all muscles were simulated with default properties and signals were simulated as being
127     recorded using the enlarged uptake area of a CNEMG electrode positioned axially 20 mm from the center
128     of the endplate region, and randomly positioned radially within the territories of the simulated MUs. For
129     each scenario, ten EMG signals each containing 4 MUPTs were simulated for 10 unique radial needle
130     positions. Forty MUPTs per scenario were then extracted from the EMG signals using DQEMG algorithms.
131     2.2 Exemplary human data
132     Exemplary data is presented through three examples (Figures 5 to 7), corresponding to a control,
133     neurogenic and myopathic subject. Muscles sampled were the gastrocnemius, gastrocnemius, extensor
134     digitorum communis and vastus lateralis, and deltoid respectively, as detailed in section 3.5.
135     Data for all three cases were collected through retrospective review and were analysed using DQEMG®
136     with the approval of the local ethics committee (Biomedical Research Institute, Jiménez Díaz Foundation
137     University Hospital; code EO181-20_FJD). Diagnoses were those made by the examining neurophysiologist
138     (OGE) at the time of the study, based on the results of the clinical and neurophysiological examination.
139     EMG signals were acquired during a sustained mild effort protocol of 10 sec duration as part of the routine
140     neurophysiological examination. Intramuscular signals were detected with a standard concentric needle
141     electrode (38 x 0.45 mm (1.5” x 26G) Neuroline Concentric; Ambu®, Denmark). Raw EMG signals were
142     bandpass filtered (20 Hz - 10 kHz) and stored using a KeyPoint.Net 3.22® device (Alpine Biomed, USA).
143     2.3 MUPT Extraction
144     To obtain representative as well as shape instability MUP/NFM information a MUPT must be extracted
145     from a recorded EMG signal from which a representative/template MUP/NFM can be selected or
146     estimated and across which MUP/NFM shape instability can be measured. MUPTs can be extracted using
147     level or window trigger or pattern recognition algorithms. In this work, MUPTs were extracted from
148     simulated or real concentric needle-detected EMG signals using the algorithms contained in DQEMG
149     (Stashuk 1999a). These algorithms execute the following steps for MUPT extraction and analysis: 1) MUP
150     detection, 2) initial MUP clustering, 3) supervised MUP classification, 4) MUPT splitting and merging, 5)
151     extracted MUPT characterization. During MUPT extraction, the current DQEMG algorithms specifically
152     account for MUP instability within a MUPT.
153     2.4 Choice of High-Pass Filter
154     To increase the effects of the radial distances to muscle fibres on detected MUPs and thus enhance
155     contributions of near fibres to detected MUPs, the detected EMG signals are high-pass filtered. For
                                                                                                                                            5

156     conventional SFEMG analysis signals are usually filtered using a Butterworth high-pass filter with a 500 or
157     1000 Hz cut-off frequency. Earlier work (Stashuk 1999b), has demonstrated that the use of low-pass-
158     double-differentiation (LPDD) filters (Usui and Amidror 1982; McGill et al. 1985) have similar amplitude
159     responses as traditionally-used Butterworth filters, but because of different phase responses create MUPs
160     in which it is easier to detect the contribution of single muscle fibres (i.e. MFPs). Therefore, in this work,
161     the NFMs analyzed have been created by LPDD filtering concentric-needle-detected MUPs.
162     2.5 Definition of representative/template MUP and NFM parameters
163     MUP Area - integral of the absolute value of the MUP values between the onset and end markers, times
164              the sampling time interval, in Vms.
165     MUP Duration - duration between the onset and end markers, in ms.
166     Turns – number of significant slope reversals within the MUP duration (height > 20 v)
167     NFM Area - integral of the absolute value of the NFM values between the onset and end markers, times
168              the sampling time interval, in kV/s2ms.
169     NFM Duration – duration between the onset and end markers of the NF MUP, in ms.
170     NF Count – number of fibre contributions detected within the NFM duration
171              (i.e. significant slope reversals (height > 5*NF baseline RMS) with similar rising and falling slopes)
172     NF Dispersion – time between the first and last detected fibre contribution, in ms
173     2.6 Definition of MUPT parameters
174     One objective of analyzing the MUPs comprising a MUPT is to characterize the discharge pattern of the
175     associated MN using the occurrence or detection times of the composite MUPs. An additional objective
176     is to assess NMJ transmission time variability and/or AAP and MFAP conduction time variability. The
177     former of these is the focus of SFEMG, in which a fibre pair (FP) jitter measurement is obtained when a
178     pair of fibre contributions are repeatedly detected in successive MUPs across a MUPT, and the variance
179     of their inter potential intervals (IPIs) is used to characterize the NMJ transmission time variability of the
180     fibre pair. To obtain a measure related to the NMJ transmission time variability of a larger number of NMJs
181     of a MU, statistics related to the instability of the shapes of the MUPs of a MUPT, such a jiggle, have been
182     developed (Stålberg & Sonoo, 1994). In this work, MUP jiggle has been measured using the MUPs of
183     MUPTs as well as NFM jiggle using LPDD filtered MUPs of MUPTs.
                                                                                                                                            6

184     Jiggle values, and those of other similar global-MUP-shape based statistics (Stålberg & Sonoo, 1994),
185     represent a larger number of NMJs of a MU than do fibre pair jitter measurements, are dependent on
186     shape changes and therefore the relative sizes of MUP segments and not purely their temporal variability,
187     and have normalized units which indirectly represent NMJ transmission time variability. A new statistic
188     called NFM segment jitter (NFM SJ) is introduced in this work, which represents a larger number of NMJs
189     of a MU than do fibre pair jitter measurements, is independent of the relative sizes of MUP segments and
190     more dependent on their temporal variability and is measured in s, to more directly represent NMJ
191     transmission time variability.
192     To accurately assess NMJ transmission and/or AP conduction velocity variability using extracted MUPTs,
193     the MUPs of each MUPT must first be aligned to each other. In this work, MUPs within a train are aligned
194     during the process of MUPT extraction using methods similar to the correlation maximization method of
195     Campos et al (2000).
196     2.6.1 Calculation of NFM Segment Jitter (NFM_SJ):
197     Given a set of N, NFMs comprising a MUPT, let NFMi represent the ith NFM of the MUPT.
198     Each NFMi is a set of consecutive sample values.
199     Each NFMi of the MUPT is divided into Si segments.
200     A NFM segment is an interval of a NFM over which the absolute change in the amplitude of the NFM
201     amplitude is equal to a threshold amount, segmentHeight.
202     NFMij is the jth segment of NFMi.
203     NFMij is a set of consecutive samples from NFMi such that NFMij1 is the starting index in NFMi of the jth
204     segment and NFMij2 is the ending index in NFMi of the jth segment.
205     Therefore, |NFMij1 – NFMij2| = segmentHeight
206     The segments of a NFM are contiguous.
207     Therefore, NFMi(j+1)1 = NFMij2 + 1
208     WeightedShiftSum = 0
209     SumOfWeights = 0
210     For i = 1 to i = N
211       For j = 1 to j = Si
212         If (i < N)

223     In this work, the value of segmentHeight was the greater of 0.10% of the NFM template peak to peak

226     2.7 Definition and Selection of Isolated MUPs/NFMs:
227     To accurately assess NMJ transmission and/or AP conduction velocity variability using detected
228     MUPs/NFMs it is also essential that the MUPs/NFMs used represent the activation of a single MU and not
229     be contaminated by the activity of other MUs. Such MUPs/NFMs, can be characterized as isolated
230     MUPs/NFMs. To select isolated MUPs/NFMs within a MUPT, NFMs contaminated with contributions of
231     other MUs need to be excluded. MUP/NFM contamination will cause a segment of a MUP/NFM to have
232     significantly different values than corresponding segments of previous and subsequent MUPs/NFMs.
233     Detecting these significant differences must take into account the inherent instability of the shapes of the
234     NFMs within the train as well as any trend in NFM shape across the train due to needle movement.
235     MUP/NFM instability measures are calculated over the NFM duration of the representative or template
236     NFM. Therefore, an isolated NFM only needs to be contamination free across the NFM duration interval.
237     2.7.1 Selecting Isolated NFMs:
238     An isolated NFM is not significantly contaminated by the activity of other MUs.
239     A set of isolated NFMs allow the estimation of the true electrophysiological instability of the NFMs
240     generated by a MU.
241     Given a set of N, NFMs comprising a MUPT, let NFMi represent the ith NFM of the MUPT.
242     Each NFMi is a set of consecutive sample values.
243     Let NFM_t be the NF MUP template used to represent the N, NFMs of the MUPT.
244     The NFM_t of the MUPT is divided into St segments.
245     A NFM_t segment is an interval of the NFM_t over which the absolute change in the amplitude of the
246     NFM_t amplitude is equal to a threshold amount, segmentHeight.
247     NFM_tj is the jth segment of the NFM_t.
248     NFM_tj is a set of consecutive samples from the NFM_t such that NFM_tj1 is the starting index in the
249     NFM_t of the jth segment and NFM_tj2 is the ending index in the NFM_t of the jth segment.
250     Therefore, |NFM_tj1 – NFM_tj2| = segmentHeight
251     The segments of the NFM_t are contiguous.
252     Therefore, NFM_t(j+1)1 = NFM_tj2 + 1
253     Each of the N NFMs in the MUPT are positioned as rows in a two dimensional array with N rows and k
254     columns, where k is the number of samples in NFM_t.
255     Each of the N NFMs in the MUPT are segmentally aligned with the respective St segments of NFM_t to
256     produce k columns of aligned NFM values.
                                                                                                                                            8

    medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208348.this version posted October 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint
       (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

257     Across each of the k aligned NFM value columns an average mean absolute consecutive difference (MACD)
258     is calculated, with MACDj being the value for the jth column.
259     A NFM is considered isolated if for each of its k samples the average absolute deviation of m consecutive
260     samples, centered at k, from m corresponding samples of the previous isolated NFM and from m
261     corresponding samples of the NFM template are less than 10*MACDk, where m corresponds to the
262     number of samples required to span 100 s.
263     Having a vector of MACD values allows the level of expected variation (i.e. the amount of acceptable
264     contamination) to be different for each time point across the set of NFMs with in the MUPT. Therefore,
265     the threshold values used as criteria for significant contamination in the baseline segments of the MUPT
266     will be more restrictive (have smaller values) that the threshold values used during the higher energy
267     segments. This in turn, allows the shape variability across the NFMs of the MUPT to be accurately
268     measured. The alignment of portions of the NFMs with the NFM template allow for more accurate
269     estimation of the noise present.
270     2.8 Statistical Analysis
271     All statistical analysis was completed using STATA (v.15). All parameters within each scenario were
272     assessed across levels of severity (i.e. increasing fibre diameter variability) using multi-level mixed effects
273     linear regression models, with each needle position a fixed factor. Beta (β) coefficients and 95%
274     confidence intervals are reported. Significance was accepted at p<0.05.
275     3.0 Results
276     3.1 Increasing fibre diameter variability
277     Four sets of 40 MUPTs were extracted from EMG signals recorded from muscles with MUs having default
278     mean fibre diameters (50 m) with diameter standard deviations of 1, 5, 10 and 15 m. Figure 1 panels A
279     to C show MUP and NFM size parameters across increases in fibre diameter variability. Increased MFP
280     temporal dispersion associated with increased fibre diameter variability decreases MUP area (Figure 1A)
281     and increases MUP duration (Figure 1C), but does not affect NFM area (Figure 1B).
282     Figure 1 panels D and F show number of MUP turns and NF count values across increases in fibre diameter
283     variability, respectively. All of these complexity related measures increase with the increased MFP
284     temporal dispersion associated with increased fibre diameter variability. With increased MFP dispersion,
285     increased numbers of underlying MFP contributions become evident/detectable. Figure 1 panels E and G
286     show NFM duration and NF dispersion across increases in fibre diameter variability, respectively. Increases
287     in MFP temporal dispersion are clearly and consistently reflected in all of these measures. Figure 1 panels
                                                                                                                                            9

288     H and J show MUP and NFM jiggle values, while panel I shows NFM segment jitter values across increases
289     in fibre diameter variability. Even though the modelled NMJ jitter was constant, across the increasing
290     levels of modelled fibre diameter variability, increased average MFP dispersion caused increased shape
291     instability. This caused more consistent increases in MUP versus NFM jiggle, evidenced by the larger
292     relative  coefficient (/CI) and for MUP jiggle. The temporally-based NFM segment jitter values show
293     moderate increases as indicated by the small relative  value.

298     3.2 Increasing NMJ axial location variability
299     Five sets of 40 MUPTs were extracted from EMG signals recorded from muscles with MUs having constant
300     fibre size, and mean axial endplate locations of 0 mm with endplate location standard deviations of 1, 2,
301     5, 7, and 10 mm. Figure 2 panels A to C show MUP and NFM size parameters across increases in end plate
302     scatter. As with increasing fibre diameter variability, increased MFP temporal dispersion associated with
303     increased end plate scatter clearly decreases MUP area (Figure 2A) and increases MUP duration (Figure
304     2C), but only moderately increases NFM area (Figure 2B).
305     Figure 2 panels D and F show number of MUP turns and NF count values across increases in end plate
306     scatter, respectively. All of these complexity related measures increased with the increased MFP temporal
307     dispersion associated with increased end plate scatter. The increases in numbers of turns and NF count
308     were greater than for the study of increased fibre diameter variability (range of mean turns values 4-10
309     versus 4-8; range of mean NF count values 2-6 versus 2-3). Figure 2 panels E and G show NFM duration
310     and NF dispersion values across increases in end plate scatter, respectively. Increases in MFP temporal
311     dispersion are clearly and consistently reflected in all of these measures. As with the complexity measures,
312     the NFM duration, and NF dispersion values were about greater than for the study of increased fibre
313     diameter variability (range of mean NFM duration values 2.5-7.5 versus 2.5-4; range of mean NF
314     dispersion values 0.5-4.5 versus 0.5-2). Figure 2 panels H and J show MUP and NFM jiggle values, while
315     panel I shows NFM segment jitter values across increases in end plate scatter. Even though the modelled
316     NMJ jitter was constant, across the increasing levels of modelled end plate scatter, increased average MFP
317     dispersion lead to increased shape instability. This caused more consistent increases in MUP versus NFM
318     jiggle, evidenced by the larger relative  coefficient (/CI) for MUP jiggle. The temporally-based NFM
319     segment jitter values show clear increases as indicated by the large relative  value.

325     3.3 Simulated MU diminution and expansion
326     To consider a simple model of partial/distal denervation and reinnervation with fibre atrophy and
327     hypertrophy, four sets of 40 MUPTs related to 4 degrees of involvement were extracted. The MUs were
328     simulated to have characteristic as outlined in Table 1 below. Of the 4 simulated MUs for each muscle, 2
329     have ‘denervated’ and 2 have ‘compensated/reinnervated’ characteristics. Where fibre number is
330     increased, so is fibre diameter variability and endplate scatter.

335
336     Figure 3 panel A shows MUP area decreasing with denervation and remaining unchanged with
337     reinnervation relative to the default model. Only at the highest level of involvement simulated do
338     reinnervated MUs have increased MUP area relative to denervated MUs. For denervated MUs, the
339     decreases in MUP area are not due to increased temporal dispersion of the MFPs comprising the
340     simulated MUPs but only the reduced numbers of MU fibres. For the reinnervated MUs, the increased
341     temporal MFP dispersion, caused by increased fibre diameter variability and increased end plate scatter,
342     combined with increased numbers of MU fibres result in no clear trend in MUP area. MUP duration
343     however, shown in Figure 3 panel C, clearly decreases and increases for denervated and reinnervated
344     MUs, respectively, as expected. NFM area, shown in Figure 3 panel B, did not change with denervation.
345     With reinnervation, NFM area was increased with respect to the default and denervated models, but with
346     increased variability no trend with reinnervation was evident. Figure 3 panels D and F do not show any
347     trends in the numbers of turns and NF count values with increased denervation. The constant fibre
348     diameter variability and end plate scatter modelled across the levels of increased denervation modelled
349     resulted in no changes to these complexity measures despite the reduced numbers of MU fibres. These
350     panels do show increasing trends in the numbers of turns and NF count values with increased
351     reinnervation. The increased fibre diameter variability and end plate scatter modelled across the levels of
352     increased reinnervation modelled resulted in clear changes to these complexity measures despite the
353     increased numbers of MU fibres.

360     Figure 3 panels E and G do not show any trends in NFM duration or NFM dispersion with increased
361     denervation. The constant fibre diameter variability and end plate scatter modelled across the levels of
362     increased denervation modelled resulted in no changes to these NFM measures. These panels do show
363     increasing trends in NFM duration or NF dispersion with increased reinnervation. The increased fibre
364     diameter variability and end plate scatter modelled across the levels of increased reinnervation modelled
365     resulted in clear changes to these NFM measures. Figure 3 panels H, J and I do not show any trends in
366     MUP or NFM jiggle and NFM segment jitter with increased denervation, respectively. These panels do
367     show increasing trends in MUP jiggle and NFM segment jitter, but not NFM jiggle with increased
368     reinnervation. With the constant amount of NMJ jitter modelled across the increasing levels of
369     denervation and reinnervation modelled no trend in instability measures are expected. However, the
370     increased fibre diameter variability and end plate scatter modelled across the levels of increased
371     reinnervation modelled resulted in increased MUP jiggle and NFM segment jitter values.
372     3.4 Increasing levels of jitter (NMJ transmission time variability)
373     Six levels of jitter (NMJ transmission time variability) were modelled (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 s). For
374     each jitter level, ten EMG signals each containing 4 MUPTs were simulated for 10 unique radial needle
375     positions. Forty MUPTs were then extracted from the EMG signals for each level of jitter using DQEMG
376     algorithms. Figure 4 panels A to C show MUP and NFM size parameters across increases in jitter. Increased
377     MFP temporal dispersion associated with increased jitter does not decrease MUP area, except for 120 s
378     jitter, (Figure 4A), while NFM area (Figure 4B) and MUP duration (Figure 4C) do not change across all jitter
379     values studied. Figure 4 panels D and F show no changes in number of MUP turns or NF count values
380     across all increases in jitter studied. Figure 4 panels E and G show no changes in NFM duration or NF
381     dispersion across all increases in jitter studied. Figure 4 panels H and J show MUP and NFM jiggle values,
382     while panel I shows NFM segment jitter values across increases in jitter. All of these measures clearly
383     reflect the increases in modelled jitter. The temporally-based NFM segment jitter values, with units in s,
384     had the highest  and relative  values.

391     3.5 Exemplary Human Patient Data
392     Figures 5 to 7 show exemplary real EMG data from healthy, enlarging/reinnervating and depleted MUs of
393     a control, neurogenic and myopathic subject, respectively.
394     Figure 5 shows a normal MUP template, an NFM template with moderate duration and dispersion and a
395     stable NFM raster/shimmer. It corresponds to a 65 y.o. woman presenting with right lumbar pain and
396     occasional paresthesia in the right L5 dermatome. EMG and MRI findings were normal and symmetric
397     compared with the asymptomatic contralateral side. The MUP data displayed was taken from the
398     contralateral asymptomatic gastrocnemius considered as a reference.
399     Figure 6 corresponds to a 70 y.o. male presenting with progressive asymmetric weakness, muscle mass
400     loss and spasticity over the last year. Needle EMG revealed extended ongoing denervation (i.e. fibrillation
401     potentials and positive sharp waves), fasciculations and reduced recruitment together with polyphasic
402     unstable and enlarged MUPs in three body segments, meeting the revised El Escorial criteria for definite
403     ALS. Panels A to C show different stages of MUP denervation-reinnervation. In panel A, two normal shaped
404     and sized MUP templates along with NFM templates with increased dispersion and moderately unstable
405     NFM shimmers, suggest an early stage of reinnervation. In panel B, two normal sized MUP templates with
406     increased shape complexity as well as NFM templates with increased duration, dispersion and increasingly
407     unstable NFM shimmers suggest an advanced stage of ongoing reinnervation. Panel C displays two
408     enlarged MUP templates associated with NFM templates with increased duration and dispersion, and
409     only moderately unstable NFM shimmers suggesting mature reinnervation, as well as a small MUP
410     template associated with a NFM template with increased duration and dispersion and a stable NFM
411     shimmer, possibly suggesting depletion of an enlarged MUP through degeneration of distal nerve
412     terminals (de Carvalho & Swash, 2016).
413     Figure 7 corresponds to a middle-aged woman diagnosed with dermatopolymyositis in childhood
414     currently on immunosuppressant at low doses for intercurrent arthritis (Azathioprine), who presented
415     with symmetric residual weakness in proximal muscles during both moderate and sustained efforts.
416     Needle EMG did not show evidence of active myositis and routine nerve conduction studies were
417     anodyne. The figure shows a small size MUP template, complex in shape (increased number of turns) and
418     a NFM template with increased NF counts and dispersion, but duration in the upper limit of normality and
419     a stable NFM shimmer.

423     of isolated NFMs, an 18 and 8 ms sweep MUP template, and an 8 ms sweep NFM shimmer and template
424     are shown. The top to bottom vertical lines demarcate the NFM duration, in the NFM template the
425     elements of the NFM count are demarcated by short vertical lines. The interval between the first and last
426     short vertical line is the NFM dispersion. Associated MUP and NFM template as well as MUPT parameter
427     values are shown. The MUP template is of somewhat below average size, the NFM template is of average
428     duration and dispersion and the NFM raster/shimmer is stable. Note that the rasters of isolated NFMs as
429     well as the calculated NFP SJ value indicate healthy NMJ transmission temporal stability in spite of slight
430     needle movement during signal acquisition.

473     4.0 Discussion
474     NFEMG focuses on contributions/MFPs of MU muscle fibres lying close to the detection surface of a
475     needle electrode. NFM measurements of the number, temporal dispersion and temporal consistency of
476     generated MFPs are dependent on local MU morphology and electrophysiology and as such can infer
477     subtle MU changes as occurring with ageing and/or disease. As demonstrated with simulations of
478     increased fibre diameter variability or endplate scatter, as the spread in the expected MFAP arrival times
479     (i.e. the times at which the MFAPs are expected to pass closest to the center of the electrode detection
480     surface) increases so do the number and temporal dispersion of detected MFPs. Increasing fibre diameter
481     variability and end plate scatter are early effects of neuromuscular disorders and ageing and precursors
482     to changes in MU size and fibre grouping. Being able to detect these initial MU changes potentially allows
483     early more sensitive detection of MU abnormalities.
484     The effects of increasing amounts of simulated fibre diameter variability on MUP and NFM template and
485     instability parameters are presented in Figure 1. MUP area decreases with increasing fibre diameter
486     variability (MUP amplitude( Vpp) follows the same pattern, values not shown) which can be a consequence
487     of increased MFP dispersion associated with increasing fibre diameter variability, which can result in more
488     destructive MFP superpositions causing phase cancelation, even though the number of contributing MFP
489     remains constant. Notably, these effects would likely be reduced with a smaller axial distance separating
490     the electrode and endplate region. MUP duration, in contrast, increased with increasing fibre diameter
491     variability (Figure 1C) which can also be a consequence of increased MFP dispersion associated with
492     increasing fibre diameter variability, ultimately increasing the time interval between MUP onset and end
493     positions. These results are consistent with those of Stålberg & Karlsson (2001) who reported both MUP
494     Vpp and area decreases for simulated data with increases in MFP dispersion. NFM area was not affected
495     by increased fibre diameter variability (Fig 1B) which can be related to the relatively smaller number of
496     MFPs that make significant contributions to NFMs. As such, NFM area measures were in general more
497     variable and did not show a clear relationship with fibre diameter variability. Turns and NF count both
498     increased with fibre diameter variability (Fig 1 D, F) without increases in numbers of MU fibres or MU fibre
499     density and specifically due to increases in MFP dispersion allowing increased numbers of MFP
500     contributions to be detected. NFM duration and NF dispersion both increased with increases in fibre
501     diameter variability (Fig 1 E,G). Each of these temporal measures are directly related to MFP dispersion
502     and clearly reflect increases in MFP dispersion caused by increases in the range of MFAP conduction
503     velocities associated with increases in fibre diameter variability. MUP jiggle, NFM jiggle and NFM SJ across
504     MUPTs all had similar modest increases with increased MFP dispersion associated with increased fibre
                                                                                                                                          22

505     diameter variability, explained by MFP contributions and their associated temporal variability becoming
506     easier to observe.
507     The results of simulating increasing amounts of end plate scatter on MUP and NFM template and
508     instability parameters are presented in Figure 2. Overall, the respective template parameters were
509     similarly affected by increases in end plate scatter as with increases in fibre diameter variability. However,
510     the effects of the amounts of endplate scatter were greater than those of the amounts of fibre diameter
511     variability. The levels of endplate scatter simulated generated greater amounts of MFP dispersion which
512     is reflected in the increased trends of the template parameter values. The MUP and NFM instability
513     measures all had similar modest increases, which were, despite the increased amounts of MFP dispersion,
514     similar in extent as with the fibre diameter variability simulations (Fig 2 H,J,I).
515     The effects of simulating MU remodelling, the denervation and reinnervation of fibres, on MUP and NFM
516     template and instability parameters are presented in Figure 3. These data demonstrate effects of
517     decreasing numbers of MU fibres (denervation), and increasing numbers of MU fibres along with
518     increasing fibre diameter variability and endplate scatter (reinnervation). For MUs with fewer numbers of
519     fibres, MUP area and duration decreased with decreasing numbers of MU fibres. The reversal of this
520     pattern could be assumed of all other modelled parameters remained constant. For MUs with greater
521     fibre numbers, diameter and endplate variability, MUP area clearly increased only after 40 fibres were
522     added, while duration consistently increased with increasing numbers of MU fibres (Fig 3 A, C). For both
523     scenarios NFM area remained constant but became more variable with increasing numbers of MU fibres
524     and the increasing MFP dispersion modelled (Fig 3 B). Turns and NF count remained constant across
525     decreasing numbers of MU fibres and both increased with increasing numbers of MU fibres and the
526     increasing MFP dispersion modelled (Fig 3 D, F). NFM duration and dispersion remained constant across
527     decreasing numbers of MU fibres and both increased with increasing numbers of MU fibres and the
528     increasing MFP dispersion modelled (Fig 3 E, G). Across the increasing numbers of MU fibres simulated,
529     NFM duration and dispersion clearly reflect the increasing level of MFP dispersion modelled. Despite the
530     increased amounts of MFP dispersion modelled, the MUP and NFM instability measures all had similar
531     modest increases, which were similar in extent as with the fibre diameter variability simulations (Fig 3
532     H,J,I).
533     With or without MFP dispersion, MUP Vpp and area values were strongly correlated (r=0.82, data not
534     shown). Without MFP dispersion (denervation), MUP area and MUP duration decreased and reflects the
535     number of MU fibres. However with MFP dispersion (reinnervation), MUP area showed little change and
                                                                                                                                          23

536     MUP duration increased, therefore either may not reflect the number of MU fibres. NFM area is less
537     affected by MFP dispersion than MUP area and duration. Therefore, if MFP dispersion is increased, NFM
538     area may not be strongly correlated with MUP area or duration but nonetheless can be reflective of the
539     number of MU fibres. NF count is well correlated with number of turns and can equally reflect the MFP
540     dispersion underlying MUP/NFM complexity. NF count is not directly related to fibre density
541     measurements obtained using a SFEMG electrode (Stalberg and Thiele 1975) because to obtain the latter
542     measurements, the needle is positioned to obtain minimal MUP rise times from a single MU, whereas for
543     the former, the needle is positioned to obtain suitably sharp MUPs across the interference pattern. NFM
544     duration is strongly correlated with NFM dispersion and both most clearly and directly reflect MFP
545     dispersion.
546     The results of simulating increasing amounts of jitter on MUP and NFM template and instability
547     parameters are presented in Figure 4. MUP area and duration drop for high jitter values (Fig 4 A, C). All
548     other MUP and NFM template parameters are unaffected by increasing jitter. However, MUP and NFM
549     jiggle and NFM SJ values increased with increasing jitter (Fig 4 H, J, I) and are therefore all strongly
550     correlated with and clearly reflect NMJ transmission time variability.
551     Unlike fibre pair jitter, measured using a single-fibre or concentric needle electrode to detect sets of MFP
552     contributions from isolated pairs of muscle fibres (Sanders & Stålberg, 1996; Stålberg & Sanders, 2009),
553     MUP and NFM jiggle and NFM SJ represent the amount of MFP temporal variability across all of the MFPs
554     significantly contributing to the MUPs/NFMs of a MUPT. Jiggle expresses MFP temporal variability
555     (primarily NMJ transmission time variability) by measuring MUP instability along the amplitude axis. Jiggle,
556     measured using sums of median consecutive absolute amplitude differences, which reduce the effects of
557     small needle movements and contamination from other MUs, and the ratio to template area, which
558     reduces the effects of needle focusing/positioning, was determined the best of several instability
559     measures considered by Stålberg and Sonoo, 1994. Nonetheless, in real signals, MUP jiggle values are
560     more contaminated by contributions from other MUs (Campos et al. 2000) than are NFM jiggle or NFM SJ
561     values. Algorithms used in this work to extract MUPTs and to select isolated MUPs/NFMs are specifically
562     designed to account for MUP/NFM instability, to minimize the effects of needle positioning/focusing and
563     to effectively align MUPs/NFMs for instability assessment to reduce contamination and other sources of
564     instability measurement error described in earlier works (Campos et al., 2000; Stålberg & Sonoo, 1994).
565     With jitter held at a constant “reference” value (25 s), MUP and NFM jiggle and NFM SJ increased with
566     MFP temporal dispersion as the effects of more individual MFP components could be determined (Fig. 1
                                                                                                                                          24

567     H,I,J and Fig. 2 H,I,J). However, the increased values do not exceed “reference” values (<50%, < 50 s).
568     Stålberg & Sonoo (1994) discussed how MUP polyphasia, caused by increased MFP temporal dispersion
569     exposes inherent/true instability which can be masked with decreased MFP temporal dispersion where
570     jittering MFPs are simply consistently superimposed such that the apparent/measurable jitter/temporal
571     instability is reduced. In other words, instability measures can increase due solely to MFP temporal
572     dispersion as the inherent/true temporal variability can be more accurately measured. This in turn
573     suggests that increased polyphasia without increased jiggle can indicate chronic myopathic fibre diameter
574     variability increases (Stålberg & Sonoo, 1994). MUP jiggle was affected more by mean MFP temporal
575     dispersion than were NFM jiggle and NFM SJ and NFM SJ was affected more by mean MFP temporal
576     dispersion than was NFM jiggle. Due to the larger MUs simulated, 100+ here versus their 10 fibres, the
577     drop in MUP jiggle versus MU size reported by Stålberg & Sonoo was not apparent in this data for either
578     MUP and NFM jiggle of NFM SJ (Fig 3 H,J,I). Even though for small amounts of jitter (20 s), its mean values
579     were relatively high and for high amounts of jitter (100 and 120 s) its mean values were relatively low,
580     the temporally based NFM SJ measure had the strongest relationship with increasing jitter. Because
581     increases in NFM SJ more closely track those of simulated jitter it can be considered more directly related
582     to the inherent temporal instability of MFP contributions to MUPs than are MUP and NFM jiggle, and is
583     therefore more sensitive for detecting temporal instability in MUPTs.
584     Figures 5 to 7 show exemplary real data recorded from healthy, expanding and depleted MUs,
585     respectively. Results from a healthy MU (Fig 5) show a moderate MUP area (size), with average NFM
586     duration and dispersion and stable NFM raster and shimmer plots (healthy NMJ transmission). Results
587     from the expanding MU (Fig 6) show two average size MUPs (panel A), with incipient increases in NFM
588     duration and dispersion and increased instability in the NFM shimmer plot (increased NMJ transmission
589     time variability reflecting emerging reinnervation). In panel 6B results from two average size MUPs with
590     increased shape complexity show prominent increases in NFM duration, dispersion and NFM shimmer
591     instability, reflecting prominent reinnervation. Whereas panel 6C shows an enlarged, a moderately
592     enlarged and a reduced sized MUP, all with increased and similar NFM duration and dispersion values and
593     rather stable NFM shimmer plots, possibly resembling distal axonal damage affecting longstanding
594     enlarged and stable MUs as part of the neurogenic process. Results from the depleted MU (Fig 7) show
595     slightly reduced MUP sizes, with increased NFM duration and dispersion and stable NFM shimmer plots.
596     The NFM duration and dispersion (7.7, 8.2 and 3.0, 2.9 ms, respectively) measured for the two expanding
597     MUs in Figure 6C are clearly longer than for the healthy MU (4.3 and 1.3 ms, respectively) and greater
                                                                                                                                          25

598     than for any values obtained from simulations of only increased fibre diameter variability. This suggests,
599     an MFP dispersion associated with more than just increased fibre diameter variability. It suggests some
600     degree of increased end plate scatter and possibly some increased fibre diameter variability consistent
601     with axonal branch sprouting and possibly some fibre atrophy and/or hypertrophy. The increased NFM SJ
602     value in both MUPs in panel 6A (68.7 and 54.1 s) clearly suggests increased NMJ transmission time
603     variability consistent with immature/nascent NMJ formations. All of these NFM results are consistent
604     with ongoing reinnervation and given that their respective MUP areas (2402 and 2236 Vms) are only
605     slightly increased and duration is within the normal range (11.0 and 11.2 ms, respectively) suggests an
606     initial/early stage of reinnervation.
607     When considering myopathic depleted MUs (Fig 7), NF count, NFM duration and dispersion values, for all
608     the MUs sampled from a single contraction, are longer than for the healthy MU (4, 4.3 ms and 1.3 ms,
609     respectively) and greater than for any values obtained from simulations of only increased fibre diameter
610     variability. This suggests an MFP dispersion associated with more than just increased fibre diameter
611     variability. It suggests some degree of increased end plate scatter and possibly some increased fibre
612     diameter variability consistent with axonal branch sprouting and possibly some fibre atrophy and/or
613     hypertrophy. The reduced MUP areas and normal durations suggest MUs may have reduced numbers of
614     fibres of variable diameter and possibly some increased end plate scatter.
615     Sonoo, 2002 suggests the most important aspects of MU changes caused by neuromuscular disorders
616     manifest as recruitment abnormalities, rather than as changes in MUP morphology. However, NFM
617     measurements have the ability to reflect MU changes before the MUs and/or the numbers of MUs in a
618     muscle significantly change and therefore before significant changes in MUP size (See Fig. 6 B). Sonoo,
619     2002 also suggests that needle position (focusing) and the level of muscle activation during MU sampling,
620     greatly influence the parameters of sampled MUPs. NFM measures of dispersion and instability are not
621     directly dependent of MUP size and shape and therefore are less affected by focusing and level of
622     activation. And finally, Sonoo, 2002 suggests that MUP duration, considered to be the cardinal parameter
623     in MUP analysis, has several drawbacks, including high measurement variability and low discriminant
624     sensitivity. This is no doubt true when baseline noise affects onset and end marker positions. However,
625     for low noise waveforms, as with the noise-free simulated data, MUP duration, as suggested by (Buchthal
626     and Rosenfalck 1955), is most sensitive to MU size. MUP duration increases with MU size and MFP
627     dispersion, while MUP area increases with MU size but decreases with MFP dispersion, which often
628     accompanies MU enlargement via reinnervation, and therefore confounds the relationship between MU
                                                                                                                                          26

629     size and MUP area (See Figs. 1C, 2C, 3C and 4C). Nonetheless in practice, low-noise waveforms may not
630     be available and therefore area, which is highly repeatable in young and old muscles (Piasecki et al. 2018),
631     and less affected by specific onset and end marker positions may better reflect MU size, despite its
632     decreases with MFP dispersion. Actually, increased MUP duration results from several factors in addition
633     to the number of innervated muscle fibres, including end-plate scatter, NMJ transmission delay, and slow
634     conduction through terminal branching axonal sprouts. This results in decreased synchronicity of muscle
635     fibre activation (i.e. MFP generation) across a motor unit, and increased MUP duration (de Carvalho &
636     Swash, 2016). As shown in the simulated data results, NFM duration and NF dispersion are both very
637     sensitive to MFP temporal dispersion caused by fibre diameter variability and/or end plate scatter (which
638     as simulated can also account for NMJ transmission delay and slow axonal branch conduction).
639     With active denervation and reinnervation MUPs and NFMs are unstable. Newly-formed, immature end-
640     plates have immature acetylcholine receptor subunits, with a lower safety factor for neuromuscular
641     transmission (Stålberg, 1982; Stålberg & Antoni, 1980). In addition, slowed distal motor nerve conduction
642     in partially myelinated regenerating nerve fibres and atrophied, newly reinnervated muscle fibres leads
643     to increased fibre diameter variability and end plate scatter which results in sufficient MFP dispersion that
644     the inherent NMJ transmission time variability can be accurately measured. For these measurements,
645     Stålberg and Sonoo (1994) suggest MUP instability, the ‘jiggle’, is best evaluated using a 500 Hz or1 kHz
646     high-pass filter, giving important qualitative information regarding MUP morphology and MUP instability.
647     NFM jiggle and NFM SJ are both based on high-pass filtered signals and both can provide useful measures
648     strongly related to NMJ transmission time variability. MUP instability anticipates the development of
649     neurogenic MUPs as shown by concentric needle EMG (de Carvalho & Swash, 2013) and can be useful in
650     differential diagnoses. (See Fig 6A and B). Furthermore, de Carvalho et al., 2014 report that mean MUP
651     duration and jitter increases are the most sensitive parameters for tracking ALS and that at the end stages
652     of ALS, small MUPs may be observed, possibly resulting from degeneration of distal nerve terminals
653     through axonal dying-back pathology (de Carvalho & Swash, 2016) (possibly the lower MU shown in Fig
654     6C). As such, MUP area, NFM duration, NFM dispersion, NFM jitter and NFM SJ, assessed together are
655     well suited for detecting and tracking MU morphology and electrophysiological changes.
656     Conclusion
657     Standard needle EMG examination can detect fibre denervation, reinnervation, loss, atrophy and
658     hypertrophy, but detecting initial changes and quantifying their extent and progress requires more
659     sophisticated techniques which can also provide a temporal profile of a disease process across longitudinal
                                                                                                                                          27
