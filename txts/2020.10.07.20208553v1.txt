47     Key– points:
48     Questions: What is the pooled diagnostic accuracy of FDA authorized serology tests to detect
49     SARS-CoV-2 antibodies?
50     Findings: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of seven reports from FDA authorized
51     serology tests to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV2 antibodies (3336 patients/ samples)
52     pooled sensitivity was 87%, and pooled specificity was almost 100%. There was a wide variation
53     in test performance based on the duration between the onset of symptoms and the tests.
54     Meaning: FDA authorized tests are highly accurate to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
55     antibodies if tests are performed under a similar condition, as presented in the original report.
56     There is a wide variation in the test performance based on the time interval between the onset of
57     symptoms to the tests.

70     Abstract:
71     Importance: Serology tests are diagnostic and complementary to molecular tests during the
72     COVID-19 pandemic.
73     Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FDA authorized serology tests for the
74     detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
75     Data sources: A search of MEDLINE, SCOPUS, CINAHL Plus, and EMBASE up to April 4,
76     2020, was performed to identify studies using the "COVID 19 testing" and "meta-analysis." FDA
77     website was accessed for the list of tests for emergency use authorization (EUA).
78     Study Selection: Manufacturer reported serology tests published in the FDA website were
79     selected. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the selected reports.
80     Data extraction and synthesis: The meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the
81     PRISMA guidelines. A bivariate analysis using the "random-effects model" was applied for
82     pooled summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and the summary receiver operating
83     characteristic curves.
84     Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the serology
85     test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subgroup analysis of the diagnostic accuracy with lag
86     time between symptom onset and testing were studied.
87     Results: Seven manufacturer listed reports were included. The pooled sensitivity was 87% (95%
88     CI, 78% - 93%), the pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI, 97% - 100%), and the area under the
89     hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.97. At ≤ 7 days, sensitivity
90     was 44% (95% CI, 21% - 70%), and for 8-14 days, sensitivity was 84% (95% CI, 67 % - 94%).

 91     For blood draws ≥ 15 days after the onset of symptoms, sensitivity was 96% (95% CI, 93% -
 92     98%). Heterogeneity was substantial, and the risk of bias was low in this analysis.
 93
 94     Conclusions and relevance: FDA authorized serology tests demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy
 95     for SARS-CoV-2 infection (certainty of evidence: moderate). There is a wide variation in the test
 96     accuracy based on the duration between the onset of symptoms and the tests (certainty of
 97     evidence: low).

116     Background:
117                Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a current global threat, and diagnostic tests are
118     critical. COVID-19 was discovered in Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, caused by a
119     pathogen of unknown origin,1,2 which was subsequently named severe acute respiratory
120     syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 has currently caused a pandemic. 3, 4 The
121     genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was added to the GenBank sequence repository on January
122     10, 2020, 2,5 which enabled laboratories across the world to develop and use reverse
123     transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for the diagnosis. Both the World Health
124     Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend an
125     RT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 6,7
126               SARS- CoV-2 is a new pathogen in humans, so there are no antibodies found in a person
127     not exposed to this virus. 7 The rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent-phase sera
128     tested in parallel is definite evidence of the viral infection. 7 Seroconversion after SARS-CoV-2
129     infection appears as early as the fourth day after the onset of symptoms, 8 but can be delayed
130     beyond 15 days. 9 Previous publications have supported the use of serological tests for the
131     detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 9,10 WHO has affirmed the use of seroconversion or an
132     increase in antibody titer for the diagnosis of SARS- CoV-2. 7 However, the CDC does not
133     recommend serological tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Nonetheless, the Food and Drug
134     Administration (FDA) has authorized emergency use authorizations (EUA) for diagnostic
135     serological tests for COVID-19 6, 11 as a valuable tool for the management of this pandemic.

136               Serological tests offer several advantages including (1) contact tracing; (2) serologic
137     surveillance; (3) identification of those who have already had the virus infection and thus may (if
138     there is protective immunity) be immune; 12 (4) to identify individuals as a potential source for
139     convalescent serum treatments (currently an experimental treatment or prophylaxis); 13, 14 (5) to
140     do epidemiological researches; (6) theoretically to diagnose a person in a late stage of disease
141     when RT- PCR may be false negative; 15 and (7) evaluation and development of a vaccine. 15,16
142               With the novel Coronavirus surge, testing brings challenges with variability in
143     performance, including sensitivity and specificity. 15 Therefore, the purpose of this review was to
144     evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the FDA authorized diagnostic serological tests for SARS-
145     CoV-2 infection.
146     Methods
147     Literature search
148               We used the FDA website to search for all FDA authorized, under emergency use
149     authorization (EUA), in-vitro serology diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2. We performed a search
150     for systematic reviews up to April 4, 2020, using the term "COVID 19 testing" and “meta-
151     analysis” in the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. This
152     search was limited to publication in the "English" language.
153     Inclusion criteria
154               We included all FDA authorized diagnostic serological tests (before April 26, 2020)
155     available to use in the United States of America. We collected information from the
156     authorization reports, either the manufactures' instructions/package insert. 11 Inclusions also had
157     the following criteria: index test must include qualitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2

158     antibodies [Immunoglobulin G (IgG) or Immunoglobulin M (IgM), or both], and target condition
159     must be confirmed by RT-PCR (the reference standard).
160
161     Exclusion criteria
162     (1) Serology tests not authorized by the FDA; (2) serology tests not authorized for diagnostic
163     use; (3) molecular tests authorized by the FDA.
164     Data extraction and quality assessment
165               Two authors (RP and AG) reviewed all eligible reports and extracted the data
166     independently. Disagreements between the researchers were resolved by consensus. We
167     extracted the following data: (1) manufacturer of the test; (2) settings including sample size,
168     disease status at the time of specimen collection, other clinical contexts available in the report;
169     (3) information regarding test-assay methods, specimens used; and (4) data on a true positive,
170     false positive, false negative and true negative. There was a complete agreement on the final data
171     used in the analysis.
172     We assessed the methodological quality of each study by following the guidelines from the
173     Cochrane Screening and Diagnostic Test Methods Group, a tool adapted from the QUADAS-2.
174     The four domains assessed for risk of bias were patient selection, index test, reference standard,
175     and flow and timing. We assessed the applicability concerns in the first three domains. In each
176     domain, we answered the signaling questions with 'Yes,' ‘No,’ or ‘Unclear.’ For each domain,
177     the risk of bias was judged as ‘Low,’ ‘High,’ or ‘Unclear’ risk. One review author assessed study
178     quality, which a second review-author verified. We summarized the overall quality of evidence
179     using the GRADE methodology recommended for diagnostic tests. The assessment of
180     publication bias was not applicable based on our research design.

181
182     Data synthesis and analysis
183               We constructed 2x 2 tables for all reports based on dichotomous data from the reference
184     standard (positive or negative). We performed data analysis using methods described in the
185     Cochrane Handbook of Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) Reviews. 17 We created forest plots
186     with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for sensitivity and specificity for each study using Review
187     Manager 5. 18 Summary statistics of four sets of primary data, namely true positive (TP), false
188     positive (FP), false negative (FN), and true negative (TN), were analyzed. Seroconversion,
189     which determines the accuracy of tests, after SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the time interval
190     between the onset of disease and testing. 9, 19, 20 To address the test accuracy and variation in
191     sensitivity of tests with the lag time, we performed subgroup analysis for tests done at (1) at or
192     before 7days; (2) between 8-14 days and (3) at or after 15 days after the onset of symptoms. A
193     bivariate random-effects model was used for summary effect size, and Area under curve (AUC)
194     using R software version 3.2. 21, 22 This bivariate model takes account into binomial distribution
195     for directly modeling sensitivity and specificity for within-study variations, and assumes
196     bivariate normal distribution for between-study variation. 23 We used inverse variance when
197     calculating the weights of individual studies. The DerSimonian-Laird estimator was used when
198     calculating between- study variations for statistical assumptions and conservative estimates. The
199     confidence interval was estimated by the Clopper-Pearson method. Heterogeneity was
200     categorized as follows: not important (0% - 40%); moderate (30% - 60%), substantial (50% -
201     90%); and considerable (75% - 100%). 24 In addition to ROC, the Spearman’s correlation
202     coefficient (Rho) between the sensitivity and false-positive rates was calculated for the presence
203     of “cut-off” point (≥ 0.6). 25 GRADEpro software was used to create a summary of findings

205     published by the FDA.
206     Results
207               The systematic literature search yielded no meta-analysis on serological tests for SARS-
208     CoV-2 infection as of April 4, 2020. A total of 48 EUA summaries were identified from the FDA
209     website accessed on April 25, 2020, of which seven reports which met eligibility criteria were
210     included (eFigure 1 in the supplement).
211     Characteristics of the included reports
212               All seven studies are exclusively obtained from the FDA website. Information was
213     collected from the information for use (IFU) documents. The characteristics of the included
214     reports are summarized in Table 1.
215               The sample sizes in each report ranged from 70 to 1166 (total n = 3336). Five reports
216     used a qualitative detection of IgM, IgG, or both antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2, while the
217     remaining two used qualitative detection for the detection of IgG only. Demographics such as
218     age, ethnicity, gender were not available. Comorbidities of the patients who tested positive for
219     SARS-CoV-2 infection were unknown. As the cases are rising rapidly, there was no information
220     available regarding the prevalence of the disease.
221               There was an incomplete and variable reporting of the time interval between the onset of
222     symptoms and the test. Autobio® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Test had information on the timing
223     of the test relative to the onset of symptoms while Cellex® qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test
224     did not have such information. Chembio DPP® COVID-19 IgM/IgG System test had information
225     on days of blood samples collected from symptom onset in COVID patients. LIAISON® SARS-
226     CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG had information on the lag time between the onset of symptoms and the tests.

227     They performed serial tests, up to three times, for negative results. We used only the first of the
228     serial measurements in this review. Mount Sinai Laboratory COVID-19 ELISA IgG Antibody
229     Test had information on the timing of sample collection (7 to 14 days after onset of symptoms
230     and retested at 21 days if the initial test was negative). VITROS® Anti-SARS-CoV-2G had
231     information on all patients. But we did not include in our sub-group analysis as their reported
232     time did not fit into our proposed analysis. VITROS®Anti-SARS-CoV2T had information on 15
233     out of 30 subjects. The characteristics of included reports are summarized in table 1. We believe
234     the seven studies provided overall good methodological quality and low risk of bias (Figure 1).
235     See supplemental material for details of the risk of bias assessment (eFigure 2 in the
236     supplement).
237     Diagnostic performance of serology tests
238               The sensitivity of the individual tests ranged from 54% to 94% and specificity ranged
239     from 90% to 100%. We created a coupled forest plot with 95 % confidence interval for
240     individual reports with sensitivity and specificity (Figure 2). The total effect size sensitivity
241     (pooled sensitivity) of all seven studies by the random-effects model was 87% (95% CI, 78% to
242     93%) (eFigure 3 in the supplement). The Higgins’ I2 was 86%, and the Cochrane Q statistic was
243     60; p < 0.001, which suggests substantial heterogeneity. The total effect size specificity (pooled
244     specificity) of all seven studies by the random-effects model was 100% (95% CI, 97% to 100%)
245     (eFigure 4 in the supplement). The Higgins’ I2 was 93%, and the Cochrane Q statistic was 26; p
246     < 0.002, which suggests considerable heterogeneity. AUC for the SROC was significant (0.97)
247     (Figure 3). The Spearman’s correlation coefficient between the sensitivity and specificity was
248     negative 0.6, also indicating the presence of an implicit cut-off points. Overall, the diagnostic

249     accuracy of the test was 96% (95% CI, 95% to 97%). The number needed to diagnose was 1.2
250     (95% CI, 1.1 to 1.2). Around 12 persons need to be tested to return 10 positive tests.
251     Subgroup analysis
252               Subgroup analysis detected a notable variation on test sensitivity depending on the timing
253     of blood drawn after the onset of symptoms (lag time). At ≤ 7days (51 samples, 4 reports),
254     sensitivity was 44% (95% CI, 21% to 70%), for 8-14 days (152 samples, 5 reports), sensitivity
255     was 84% (95% CI, 67% to 94%). For blood draws ≥ 15 days after the onset of symptoms (329
256     samples, 3 reports), sensitivity was 96% (95% CI, 93% to 98%) (Table 2).
257     Discussion
258               Pooled sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 100 % support that the FDA authorized
259     serology tests are useful in ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection if the tests are done under similar
260     conditions as conducted in the reports. We noticed variations in testing time from the onset of
261     symptoms as well as serial measurements on some reports. Although heterogeneity of specificity
262     was higher (93%) compared to those of sensitivity (86%), SROC curve with less scattering of
263     test values and moderate Spearman’s correlation coefficient of negative 0.59 validates these
264     studies. The diagnostic accuracy and the number needed to diagnose reflect the strength of the
265     serology tests.
266               After the onset of infection with SARS-CoV-2, seroconversion occurs variably, ranging
267     from days to weeks. 27 Zhao J et al. 9 showed empirical evidence for the role of antibody titers
268     with a lag time similar to our study findings. In that study, among 173 patients, the median
269     duration for IgM and IgG antibodies seroconversion was 12 days and 14 days, respectively.
270     Moreover, less than 40% had antibody detected within the first week of illness. In another study
271     of 285 patients, median seroconversion was 13 days for IgG, with 100% positive within 19 days

272     of symptoms. 19 IgM antibodies are detectable earlier than IgG antibody (208 plasma sample:
273     IgM median 5 (IQR, 3-6 days) versus IgG median 14(IQR, 10-18 days). 20 We found an increase
274     in test sensitivity with an increase in time between the illness and the test [sensitivity 96% for
275     tests done ≥ 15 days from symptom onset (Table 2)]. This high sensitivity finding from only
276     three reports warrants validation from more extensive studies. Negative tests, on appropriate
277     clinical settings, should be interpreted with caution, mostly if the tests are done early in the
278     courses of the disease.
279               Cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with other proteins in the blood is under
280     investigation. Reports of false-positive test results are published. 28 29 Cross-reactivity between
281     SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with other known antibodies were tested in all reports. Chembio DPP®
282     COVID-19 IgM/IgG System reported cross-reactivity against human coronavirus HKU1 and
283     human coronavirus 229E. LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG reported cross-reactivity against
284     the Hepatitis B Virus, Anti-Influenza A, and rheumatoid factors. These cross-reactivity
285     limitations should be considered while interpreting positive tests.
286     Limitations
287               Information on the study population is not available to critically appraise individual
288     reports. We could not verify the spectrum bias. Per protocol, we limited our search to FDA
289     authorized serology tests for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. None of the serology
290     tests have been independently verified for accuracy by the FDA. Five reports used detection of
291     IgG or IgM or both, and the remaining two used detection of IgG only for the diagnosis of
292     SARS-CoV-2. We accepted the threshold detection of antibodies as defined by individual
293     reports.

294               Heterogeneity could not be explained by threshold as the serology tests were qualitative.
295     Heterogeneity was substantial. We could not perform meta-regression or sensitivity analysis as
296     limited information was available. Higher heterogeneity in this review can arise from chance,
297     patient selection, and the type of diagnostic test.
298               We found a significant area under the curve (AUC), which represents the global summary
299     performance of the test. The symmetric shoulder of SROC represents the variability in the
300     studies and the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
301     Conclusions
302               WHO and CDC recommend RT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both
303     CDC and WHO agree that serology tests play a pivotal role in the COVID-19 pandemic
304     considering cost, diagnostic accuracy, and relatively quick results. The overall sensitivity and
305     specificity of the FDA authorized serological tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection are high
306     (certainty of evidence: moderate). There is a wide variation in the test accuracy based on the
307     duration between the onset of symptoms and the tests (certainty of evidence: low).

         e. Autobio® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Test: Included 717 patients (405 PCR positive and 312 PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection), done January to Mid- March 2020. They
            reported information on the time of testing after onset of symptoms.
         f. Cellex® qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test: included 378 (98 samples collected from individuals, who exhibited mild or no clinical symptoms, 30 samples were collected
            from hospitalized, with severe symptoms, 250 negative samples collected prior to September 2019. The day of sample collection relative to the onset of illness was
            unknown.
         g. Chembio DPP® COVID-19 IgM/IgG System: They had 31 (RT PCR confirmed positive) symptomatic subjects, in New York or East Asia during COVID -19 pandemic, 41
            symptomatic subjects who were confirmed negative by PCR. They reported information on the time of testing after onset of symptoms.
         h. LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG: 76 European patients (44 patients hospitalized with moderate symptoms and 32 severe symptoms), 1090 presumed SARS-CoV-2
            negative samples from a European laboratory routine (n=90) and European blood donors (n=1000) were collected prior to COVID-19. They performed a serial antibody
            measurement based on testing time after days of diagnosis
         i. Mount Sinai Laboratory COVID-19 ELISA IgG Antibody Test: Total 114 samples reported on table (58 samples (collected between 7 and 14 days after onset of symptoms.
            Fifty-five presumed true negative samples collected prior to the onset of the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic (that adds to 113)
         j. VITROS® Anti-SARS-CoV-2G: 48 samples collected from patients confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive by PCR were tested. Of the 48 PCR positive samples 42 were
            reactive in the VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and 6 were non-reactive 407 PCR negative control. They reported information on the time of testing after onset of
            symptoms in test positive subjects. They were not included in our subgroup analysis because the time frame did not fit in to our proposed protocol.

k. VITROS ®Anti-SARS-CoV2T: 36 samples collected from patients confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive by PCR were tested, 400 presumed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
   negative healthy blood donor. They reported information on the time of testing after onset of symptoms in 15/30 test positive subjects.
