    Abstract (word count: 231)
    Proteins detectable in peripheral blood may influence COVID-19 susceptibility or severity. However,
    understanding which circulating proteins are etiologically involved is difficult because their levels may be
    influenced by COVID-19 itself and also subject to confounding factors. To identify circulating proteins
    influencing COVID-19 susceptibility and severity we undertook a large-scale two-sample Mendelian
    randomization (MR) study, since this study design can rapidly scan hundreds of circulating proteins and
    reduces bias due to confounding and reverse causation. We began by identifying the genetic
    determinants of 955 circulating proteins in up to 10,708 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected individuals, retaining
    only single nucleotide polymorphisms near the gene encoded by the circulating protein. We then
    undertook an MR study to estimate the effect of these proteins on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity
    using the Host Genetics Initiative. We found that a standard deviation increase in OAS1 levels was
    associated with reduced COVID-19 death or ventilation (N = 2,972 cases / 284,472 controls; OR = 0.48,
    P = 7x10-8), COVID-19 hospitalization (N = 6,492 / 1,012,809; OR = 0.60, P = 2x10-7) and COVID-19
    susceptibility (N = 17,607 / 1,345,334; OR = 0.81, P = 6x10-5). Results were consistent despite multiple
    sensitivity analyses probing MR assumptions. OAS1 is an interferon-stimulated gene that promotes viral
    RNA degradation. Other potentially implicated proteins included IL10RB. Available medicines, such as
    interferon-beta-1b, increase OAS1 and could be explored for their effect on COVID-19 susceptibility and
    severity.

    Introduction
    Since its onset in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 1 million deaths worldwide,
                                                        1
    and infected over 34 million individuals. Despite the scale of the epidemic, there are at present no
    disease-specific therapies that can reduce the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and apart
    from dexamethasone therapy in oxygen dependent patients,2 most clinical trials have shown at most mild
                                                              3–5
    or inconsistent benefits in disease outcome.                  Further, vaccines are at least several months away, and
    whether they elicit protective immunity is unclear. Therefore, validated targets are needed for COVID-19
    therapeutic development.
    One source of such targets is circulating proteins. Recent advances in large-scale proteomics have
    enabled the measurement of thousands of circulating proteins at once and when combined with evidence
    from human genetics, such targets greatly improve the probability of drug development success.6–8 While
    de novo drug development will take time—even in the accelerated arena of COVID-19 therapies—
    repositioning of currently available molecules targeting those proteins, if they exist, could also provide an
    accelerated opportunity to deliver new therapies to patients.
    Nevertheless, since confounding and reverse causation often bias traditional circulating protein
    epidemiological studies, disentangling the causal relationship between circulating proteins and COVID-19
    susceptibility or severity is challenging. Confounding happens when both the circulating protein and
    COVID-19 share a common cause, and reverse causation occurs when COVID-19 itself influences the
    level of a circulating protein. Even with sophisticated statistical methods, both are difficult to control for in
    observational studies. One way to address these limitations is by using Mendelian randomization (MR), a
    genetic epidemiology method that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to test the effect of an
    exposure (here protein levels) on an outcome (here COVID-19 outcomes). Given that each person’s
    genotype is essentially randomly assigned at conception, due to Mendel’s second law, this greatly
    reduces bias due to confounding. Since genotypes are always assigned prior to disease onset, MR
                                                                                                                                       3

    studies are not influenced by reverse causation. However, MR rests on three core assumptions.9 First,
    the genetic variants must be associated with the exposure of interest. Second, they do not affect the
    outcome, except through the exposure of interest (i.e. a lack of horizontal pleiotropy) and third, they do
    not associate with the confounders of the exposure-outcome relationship.
    Of these, the most problematic is the second assumption—a lack of horizontal pleiotropy. One way to
    help avoid bias due to horizontal pleiotropy is to use genetic variants that influence circulating protein
    levels which are adjacent to the gene which encodes the circulating protein through the use of cis-protein
                                                8
    quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTLs). Given their close proximity to the target gene, cis-pQTLs are likely to
    influence the level of the circulating protein by directly influencing its transcription or translation, and
    therefore less likely to affect the outcome of interest (COVID-19) through pleiotropic pathways. The
    choice of cis-pQTLs also supports the first and third assumptions of MR, as it uses a biologically plausible
    pathway from the genetic variant to the exposure.
    Recently developed MR methods, using two-sample MR,10 allow for the rapid scanning of hundreds of
    exposures if genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been done for both the biomarker and the
               8
    outcome. Nevertheless, given that MR only requires an association between the genetic instrument and
    the exposure, a causal association between the two may be confounded by linkage disequilibrium (LD,
    the non-random association of genetic variants assigned at conception). This would happen if the
    selected genetic variants associated with both protein levels and COVID-19 are a part of separate causal
                                                               11
    mechanisms but are also related through LD. To probe this potential problem, colocalization tests can
    assess for the presence of bias from LD.
    Understanding the etiologic role of circulating proteins in infectious diseases can be challenging because
    the infection itself often leads to large changes in circulating proteins, which may act against the
    infectious agent. Thus, it may appear that an increase in a circulating protein, such as a cytokine, is
                                                                                                                                       4

    associated with a worsened outcome, when in fact, the cytokine may be the host’s response to this
    infection and help to mitigate this outcome. It is therefore important to identify genetic determinants of the
    protein levels in the non-infected state, which would reflect a person’s baseline predisposition to the level
    of a protein. Further, circulating proteins may execute their biological roles inside the cell, but then
    translocate to the peripheral blood, and thus their circulating levels can, in some circumstances, offer
    insights into their intracellular roles.
    In this study, we therefore undertook two-sample MR and colocalization analyses to combine results from
                                                                                               12
    large-scale GWASs of circulating protein levels and COVID-19 outcomes in order to prioritize proteins
    likely influencing COVID-19 outcomes. We began by identifying the genetic determinants of circulating
    protein levels in large-scale protein level GWASs. Then, after selecting the SNPs associated with
    circulating proteins, which were proximal to their encoded genes (cis-pQTLs), we assessed whether these
    cis-pQTLs were associated with COVID-19 outcomes in the ICDA Host Genetics Initiative COVID-19
    outcomes GWASs and then undertook MR analyses to estimate the effect of the circulating protein level
    of COVID-19 outcomes.
    Results
    MR using cis-pQTLs, and pleiotropy assessment
    We began by obtaining the genetic determinants of circulating protein levels from six large proteomic
    GWAS of European individuals (Sun et al13 N=3,301; Emilsson et al14 N=3,200; Pietzner et al15
    N=10,708; Folkersen et al16 N=3,394; Yao et al17 N=6,861 and Suhre et al18 N=997). A total of 955
    proteins from these six studies had cis-pQTLs associated at a genome-wide significant level (P < 5x10-8)
    with protein levels, or highly correlated proxies (LD R2 > 0.8), in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative
    GWASs (https://www.covid19hg.org/results/). We then undertook MR analyses using 1,388 directly
    matched cis-pQTLs and 50 proxies as genetic instruments for their associated circulating proteins on
    three separate COVID-19 outcomes: 1) Very severe COVID-19 disease, (defined as individuals
                                                                                                                                       5

    experiencing death, mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, high-flow oxygen, or use of
    extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) using 2,972 cases and 284,472 controls; 2) COVID-19 disease
    requiring hospitalization using 6,492 cases and 1,012,809 controls and 3) COVID-19 susceptibility using
    17,607 cases and 1,345,334 controls. These case-control phenotype definitions are referred to as A2, B2,
    and C2 by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, respectively. In all outcomes, cases required evidence
    of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For the very severe COVID-19 and hospitalization outcomes, COVID-19 cases
    were defined as laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on nucleic acid amplification or
    serology tests. For the COVID-19 susceptibility outcome, cases were also identified by review of health
    records (using International Classification of Disease codes or physician notes).
    MR analyses revealed that the levels of four circulating proteins, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1
    (OAS1), interleukin-10 receptor beta subunit (IL10RB), ABO, and liposaccharide binding protein (LBP)
    were associated with one or more COVID-19 outcomes after Bonferroni correction for the number of
                                       -5
    proteins tested (P<5.2x10 ) (Table 1, Table S1-3). We note that Bonferroni correction is overly
    conservative given the non-independence of the circulating protein levels. Notably, increased OAS1
    levels were strongly associated with protection from all three COVID-19 outcomes. Further, these effect
    sizes became more pronounced with more severe outcomes, such that each standard deviation increase
    in OAS1 levels was associated with a decreased odds of COVID-19 susceptibility of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.73-
    0.90 , P=5.63x10-5), decreasing further for hospitalized COVID-19 (OR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.50-0.73,
    P=1.69x10-7) and very severe COVID-19 (OR=0.48; 95% CI: 0.37-0.63, P=6.77x10-8) (Figure 1).
    We next assessed whether the cis-pQTL associated with OAS1 levels (rs4767027) was associated with
                                                                                                                   19
    any other phenotypes across more than 5,000 outcomes, as catalogued in PhenoScanner,                               which
    catalogues associations of SNPs with outcomes from all available GWASs. We found that the OAS1 cis-
                                                                                             -26
    pQTL was strongly associated with circulating OAS1 levels (P=6.20x10 ) in serum, whereas it was not
    associated with any other traits or protein levels (Bonferroni-corrected P<5.0x10-5). These findings reduce
    the possibility that the MR estimate of the effect of OAS1 on COVID-19 outcomes is due to horizontal
                                                                                                                                       6

    pleiotropy. Finally, except for the susceptibility outcome, the effect of rs4767027 did not demonstrate
    evidence of heterogeneity across COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative GWAS meta-analyses (Table 1).
    Next we identified an independent SNP associated with OAS1 circulating protein levels, which was not at
    the OAS1 locus and is thus as trans-SNP (rs62143197, P value for association with OAS1 levels =7.10 x
    10-21). Due to strong association with many other proteins, such as annexin A2 (P=5.62 x 10-237) and
                                                                -178
    small ubiquitin-related modifier 3 (P=9.12 x 10                 ), including this trans-SNP could introduce bias from
    potential horizontal pleiotropy effects and was thus not considered in the MR analyses.
    Similarly, using the cis-pQTL for IL10RB (rs2834167), we found that a one standard deviation increase in
    circulating IL10RB level was associated with a decreased odds for hospitalized COVID-19 (OR = 0.51;
    95% CI: 0.37-0.70, P=3.61x10-5) and very severe COVID-19 (OR=0.48; 95% CI: 0.31-0.75, P=1.08x10-3).
    However, circulating IL10RB protein level was not associated with COVID-19 susceptibility. Using
    PhenoScanner, we could not find evidence of pleiotropic effects of the cis-pQTL for IL10RB. The IL10RB
    cis-pQTL also showed a homogeneous effect across cohorts for the three COVID-19 outcomes (Table 1).
    We found that cis-pQTLs for ABO (rs505922) and LBP (rs2232613) were strongly associated with several
    other proteins, suggesting potential pleiotropic effects (Table S4). Given their known involvement in
    multiple physiological processes, these results were expected, but highlights that these MR analyses may
    suffer from significant bias from horizontal pleiotropy.
    Protein-Altering Variants
    cis-pQTLs may be, or may be in LD with, protein altering variants (PAVs)13 and thus influence MR-
    prioritized proteins if these PAVs alter the affinity and binding of the molecules used to quantify their level.
    We thus assessed if the cis-pQTLs for the MR-prioritized proteins were PAVs, or in LD (R2>0.8) with
                                                                                                                                       7

    PAVs, and if so, conditional analyses for cis-pQTLs, conditioning on their PAVs in LD, were undertaken to
    test if the cis-pQTL remained associated with the protein level. rs2834167 (IL10RB) and rs2232613 (LBP)
    are nonsense and missense variants, respectively, therefore both could be subject to potential binding
    effects. rs4767027 (OAS1) is an intronic variant, which is in LD with missense variants, however, the
    missense variants in LD with rs4767027 were absent in the original imputed dataset from Sun et al,
    therefore, no assessment for aptamer binding effects could be made. rs505922 (ABO) is not in LD with
    known missense variants.
    Colocalization Studies
    To test whether confounding due to LD may have influenced the estimated effect of circulating OAS1 on
    the three different COVID-19 outcomes, we tested the probability that the genetic determinants of OAS1
    circulating protein level were shared with the three COVID-19 outcomes using colocalization analyses.
    These were performed using coloc, a Bayesian statistical test implemented in the coloc R package.11 We
    found that the posterior probability that OAS1 levels and COVID-19 outcomes shared a causal signal (the
    posterior probability for hypothesis 4 in coloc, PP4) in the 1Mb locus around the cis-pQTL rs4767027 was
    0.75 for very severe COVID-19 (Figure 2), 0.72 for hospitalization due to COVID-19 (Figure 3), and 0.88
    for COVID-19 susceptibility (Figure 4). This suggests that there is likely one shared causal signal for
    OAS1 circulating protein levels and COVID-19 outcomes.
    Colocalization of circulating LBP levels and the three COVID-19 outcomes showed strong colocalization
    between LBP levels and hospitalization due to COVID-19 (PP4 = 0.98, Figure S2), but lack of
    colocalization between LBP level and COVID-19 susceptibility (PP4 = 0.48, Figure S1) and very severe
    COVID-19 (PP4 = 0.07, Figure S3). Colocalization of ABO levels and different COVID-19 outcomes
    showed no colocalization between ABO level and different COVID-19 outcomes (posterior probability of
    single shared signal = 0.03, 0.02 and 0.005 for ABO level and COVID-19 susceptibility, hospitalization
    due to COVID-19 and very severe COVID-19, respectively). This was likely due to the multiple
                                                                                                                                       8

    independent causal signals at the ABO locus that could not be assessed by coloc (Figures S4-6). We
    were unable to perform colocalization analysis for IL10RB due to a lack of genome-wide summary level
    data from the original proteomic GWAS.
    eQTL studies
    We next assessed whether the cis-pQTL, rs4767027 for circulating OAS1 levels, influenced expression of
    OAS1 levels across different tissues using the data from the GTEX consortium.20 We found that
    rs4767027 was an eQTL for OAS1 in whole blood (P=2.3 x 10-173), skin (P=4.2 x 10-149) , adipose (P=1.4
         -147
    x 10     ) and, critically, in lung (P=4.5 x 10-139). It is also an eQTL for the nearby genes OAS3 (P=1.1 x 10-
    78
      ) and OAS2 (P=6.9 x 10-21) in cultured fibroblasts, spleen, pancreas and whole blood. OAS1, OAS2 and
    OAS3 all encode enzymes in the same 2', 5' oligoadenylate synthase family that bind to and activate
    RNase L, leading to viral RNA degradation and inhibit viral replication.21 Investigating IL10RB, we found
    that its cis-pQTL is an eQTL for IL10RB in the brain (P=7.9x10-34), heart (P=4.9x10-22) and lung
    (P=1.2x10-13).20 Figure 5 summarizes data supporting the role of OAS1 in COVID-19 outcomes.

    Discussion:
    Disease-specific therapies are needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19
    outcomes. In this large-scale two-sample MR study of 955 proteins assessed for three COVID-19
    outcomes in up to 17,600 cases and 1.3 million controls, we provide evidence that increased OAS1 and
    IL10RB levels are strongly associated with reduced COVID-19 susceptibility, hospitalization and severe
    outcomes. For OAS1 the protective effect size was particularly large, such that a 50% decrease in the
    odds of very severe COVID-19 was observed per standard deviation increase in OAS1 circulating levels.
    Since therapies exist that activate OAS1, repositioning them as potential COVID-19 treatments should be
    prioritized.
    Each of the four MR-identified proteins has orthogonal evidence implicating their role in viral infections.
    For example, the OAS gene cluster on chromosome 12 includes OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3, which share
    significant homology and differ only in their number of OAS units. These genes all encode similar
    enzymes that are essential to host responses to viral infections. They are induced by interferons and
    activate latent RNase L, resulting in direct viral and endogenous RNA destruction, as demonstrated in in-
                    22
    vitro studies. They also increase expression of both IRF3 and IRF7, both genes involved in interferon
    gene expression. As an interferon stimulated gene23, OAS1 polymorphisms have been involved in host
                                                                                              24                   25
    immune response to several classes of viral infection including influenza , herpes simplex , hepatitis C ,
    West Nile26 Dengue27, and SARS-CoV28 viruses. Given that OAS1 is an intracellular enzyme leading to
    viral RNA degradation, it is probable that the circulating levels of this enzyme reflect intracellular levels of
    this protein. While further experiments are required to better understand the role of OAS1 in SARS-CoV-2
    infection, it is likely that the site of action of this enzyme upon the virus would be in the intracellular
    compartment.
    Molecules currently exist which can increase OAS1 activity. Interferon beta-1b, which is an OAS1
              29
    agonist, is currently used to treat multiple sclerosis and has been shown to induce OAS1 expression in
                                                                                                                                     10

    blood.30 A recent randomized controlled trial showed that interferon beta-1b combined with lopinavir-
    ritonavir reduced mortality in MERS-CoV infections, another human coronavirus.31 While lopinavir-
    ritonavir, rather than interferon beta-1b, may have been responsible for this mortality reduction a recent
    COVID-19 randomized controlled trial from the RECOVERY group showed no benefit from lopinavir-
                                                          32
    ritonavir in multiple COVID-19 outcomes. Indeed, according to clinicaltrials.gov, there are multiple on-
    going phase II randomized controlled trials testing interferon beta-1b for COVID-19 outcomes. In-vitro
    evidence also exists demonstrating that pharmacological inhibition of phosphodiesterase-12, which
                                                                                                              21
    normally degrades the OAS enzymes, potentiates this OAS-mediated antiviral activity. PDE-12 inhibitors
    potentiate the action of OAS1, 2 and 3.33 Interestingly other coronaviruses in the same betacoronavirus
    family as SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to produce viral proteins that degrade the OAS family of
    proteins, and antagonize RNase-L activity, leading to evasion of the host immune response.34,35 Thus
    classes of medications currently exist that lead to increased OAS1 levels and could be explored for their
    effect upon COVID-19 outcomes.
    Importantly OAS2 and OAS3 circulating levels were not assessed by any of the protein level GWASs and
    the lead cis-pQTL for OAS1 at this locus likely influences OAS2 and OAS3 expression levels. Thus, it
    remains possible that, in addition to influencing OAS1 levels, the lead cis-pQTL may also influence the
    abundance of OAS2 and OAS3. Nevertheless, all three genes share similar functions, structure and
    activity, highlighting that increases in the activity, or level of this family of proteins are likely to protect
                                                               36
    against COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.
    IL10RB encodes for the beta subunit of the IL10 receptor, and is part of a cluster of immunologically
    important genes including IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, both recently implicated in severe COVID-19

    pathophysiology.          IFNAR1 and 2 encode the interferon alpha/beta receptor subunits 1 and 2,
    respectively. Interestingly, while there exists a cis-pQTL strongly associated with IFNAR1 levels, it was
    not associated with any of the COVID-19 outcomes (P ~ 0.5). Further, IFNAR1 had no trans-pQTLs
    identified, which means that the IL10RB cis-pQTL does not likely reflect IFNAR1 levels. However, since
                                                                                                                                     11

    IFNAR2 was not measured in any proteomic studies, we could not test the effect of its circulating levels
    on COVID-19 outcomes. IL10RB mediates IL10 anti-inflammatory activity through its downstream
    inhibitory effect on many well-known pro-inflammatory cytokines such as janus kinases and STAT1.38
    While overexpression of IL10 has been involved in the persistence of multiple chronic bacterial infections
                                39
    such as tuberculosis, its role remains poorly understood in acute infections. In sepsis, a disease state
    characterized by high levels of cytokine activity and a rise in multiple biomarkers associated with
    inflammation, there is also a well-established paradoxical increase in anti-inflammatory IL10 production
                                                                             40
    by leukocytes, especially in the early stage of the disease. Most importantly, while in a normal
    physiological state, IL10 is usually only produced at a low level by neutrophils, its production is strongly
    upregulated by IL4, itself upregulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) when they bind LBPs.41,42 While
    LPS’s are well-known for their role in triggering gram-negative bacterial sepsis, their role in other acute
    infections and respiratory diseases is likely broader, and involves complex sequences of cytokine
                43–46
    signaling.         Nevertheless, as our MR studies showed that LBP and IL10RB protein levels affected
    COVID-19 outcome with a concordant effect direction, and given the known role of overt inflammation in
    COVID-19 morbidity, this pathway likely deserves more investigation.
    This study has limitations. First, we used MR to test the effect of circulating protein levels measured in a
    non-infected state. This is because the effect of the cis-pQTLs upon circulating proteins was estimated in
    individuals who had not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Once a person contracts SARS-CoV-2 infection,
    levels of circulating proteins could be altered and this may be especially relevant for cytokines such as
    IL10 (which binds to IL10RB), whose levels may reflect host response to the viral infection. Thus, the
    results presented in this paper should be interpreted as an estimation of the effect of circulating protein
    levels, when measured prior to infection. On-going studies will help to clarify if the same cis-pQTLs
    influence circulating protein levels during infection. As emphasized above, these circulating protein levels
    may also reflect intracellular biological processes, such as may be the case for OAS1. Second, this study
    suffers a high false-negative rate. Our goal was not to identify every circulating protein influencing
    COVID-19 outcomes, but rather to provide evidence for few proteins with strong cis-pQTLs since these
                                                                                                                                     12

    proteins are more likely to be robust to the assumptions of MR studies. Future large-scale proteomic
    studies with more circulating proteins properly assayed should help to overcome these limitations. Third,
    the colocalization analyses in this study are also subject to potential bias from mixed ethnicity from the
    COVID-19 outcome GWAS. Previous studies have already established statistical colocalization methods
    may be overly sensitive to the accurate estimation of LD structure, and thus fail to colocalize47 due to
    small differences in LD, or the presence of more than one causal signal at a locus. Nevertheless, the
    locus zoom plots (Figures 2-4) show similar signals arising from the same genomic regions for the
    protein and COVID-19 outcomes. Fourth, most MR studies assume a linear relationship between the
    exposure and the outcome. Thus, our findings would not identify proteins whose effect upon COVID-19
    outcomes has a clear threshold effect.
    In conclusion, we have used genetic determinants of circulating protein levels and COVID-19 outcomes
    obtained from large-scale studies and found compelling evidence that OAS1 has a protective effect on
    COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Known pharmacological agents that increase OAS1 levels (such as
    interferon beta-1b and PDE12 inhibitors) could be explored for their effect on COVID-19 outcomes.

    Methods:
    Cohorts
    pQTL GWAS
    We systematically identified pQTL associations from six large proteomic GWASs.13–18 Each of these
    studies undertook proteomic profiling using either SomaLogic somamer technology, or O-link proximal
    extension assays.
    COVID GWAS and COVID-19 Outcomes
    To assess the association of cis-pQTLs with COVID-19 outcomes, we used the largest COVID-19 meta-
    analytic GWAS to date from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (https://www.covid19hg.org/results/).
    The participating cohorts provided GWAS summary statistics data from either large-scale biobanks (N =
    18), hospital-based cohorts (N = 13), or direct-to-consumer genotyping companies (N = 1), which were
    meta-analyzed across ancestries and made publicly available. For our study, we used three of these
    GWAS meta-analyses, based on sample size and clinical relevance. These outcomes were very severe
    COVID-19, hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and susceptibility to COVID-19 (named A2, B2, and C2,
    respectively in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative).
    Very severe COVID-19 cases were defined as hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 as the primary
    reason for hospital admission with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (nucleic acid amplification
    tests or serology based), and death or respiratory support (intubation, continuous positive airway
    pressure, Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure, or continuous external negative pressure, Optiflow/very high
    flow Positive End Expiratory Pressure Oxygen). Simple supplementary oxygen (e.g. 2 liters/minute via
    nasal cannula) did not qualify for case status. Controls were all individuals in the participating cohorts who
    did not meet this case definition.
                                                                                                                                     14

    Hospitalized COVID-19 cases were defined as individuals hospitalized with laboratory confirmed SARS-
    CoV-2 infection (using the same microbiology methods as for the very severe phenotype), where
    hospitalization was due to COVID-19 related symptoms. Controls were all individuals in the participating
    cohorts who did not meet this case definition.
    Susceptibility to COVID-19 cases were defined as individuals with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2
    infection, health record evidence of COVID-10 (international classification of disease coding or physician
    confirmation), or with self-reported infections (e.g. by questionnaire). Controls were all individuals in the
    participating cohorts who did not meet this case definition.
    Two-sample Mendelian randomization
    We used two-sample MR analyses to screen and test potential circulating proteins for their role
    influencing COVID-19 outcomes. In two-sample MR, the effect of SNPs on the exposure and outcome are
    taken from separate GWASs. This method often improves statistical power, because it allows for larger
                                                                       48
    sample sizes for the exposure and outcome GWAS.
    Exposure definitions: We conducted MR using six large proteomic GWAS studies.13–18 Circulating
    proteins from Sun et al, Emilsson et al and Pietzner et al were measured on the SOMAlogic platform,
    Suhre et al, Yao et al and Folkersen et al used protein measurements on the O-link platform. We selected
    proteins with only cis-pQTLs to test their effects on COVID-19 outcomes, because they are less likely to
    be affected by potential horizontal pleiotropy. The cis-pQTLs were defined as the genome-wide significant
    SNPs (P < 5 × 10−8) with the lowest P value within 1 Mb of the transcription start site (TSS) of the gene
    encoding the measured protein.8 We selected one cis-pQTL per protein per each study. We included the
    same proteins represented by different cis-pQTLs from different studies in order to cross examine the
    findings. For cis-pQTLs that were not present in the COVID-19 GWAS, SNPs with LD R2>0.8 and with
    minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.42 were selected as proxies, but MAF > 0.3 was used for palindromic
                                                                                                                                     15

    alignment for proxy SNPs. cis-pQTLs with palindromic effects and with minor allele frequency (MAF) >
    0.42 were removed prior to MR to prevent allele-mismatches. Bonferroni correction was used to control
    for the total number of proteins tested using MR. We recognize that this is an overly conservative
    correction, given the non-independence of the circulating proteins, but such stringency should reduce
    false positive associations. MR analyses were performed using the TwoSampleMR package in R,49 using
    Wald ratio to estimate the effect of each circulating protein on each of the three COVID-19 outcomes.
    After matching of the cis-pQTLs of proteins with COVID-19 GWAS and the removal of palindromic SNPs,
    a total of 537 proteins (543 directly matched IVs and 22 proxies) from Sun et al, 750 proteins (731 directly
    matched IVs and 20 proxies) from Emilsson et al, 94 proteins (85 directly matched IVs and 7 proxies)
    from Pietzner et al, 74 proteins (72 directly matched IVs) from Suhre et al, 24 proteins (24 directly
    matched IVs) from Yao et al and 13 proteins (12 directly matched IVs and 1 proxy) from Folkersen et al
    were used as instruments for the MR analyses across the three COVID-19 outcomes (Table S5-7).13–18
    Pleiotropy assessments
    A common pitfall of MR is horizontal pleiotropy, which occurs when the genetic variant affects the
    outcome via pathways independent of circulating proteins. The use of circulating protein cis-pQTLs
    greatly reduces the possibility of pleiotropy, for reasons described above. We also searched in the
    PhenoScanner database, a large catalogue of observed SNP-outcome relationships involving > 5,000
    GWAS done to date to assess potentially pleiotropic effects of the cis-pQTLs of MR prioritized proteins,
    by testing the association of cis-pQTLs with other circulating proteins (i.e. if they were trans-pQTLs to
    other proteins or traits). For cis-pQTLs of MR prioritized proteins, if they were measured on SOMAlogic
    platform, we assessed the possibility of potential aptamer-binding effects (where the presence of protein
    altering variants may affect protein measurements). We also checked if cis- pQTLs of MR prioritized
    proteins had significantly heterogeneous associations across COVID-19 populations in each COVID-19
    outcome GWAS.
                                                                                                                                     16

    Colocalization analysis
    Finally, we tested colocalization of the genetic signal for the circulating protein and each of the three
    COVID-19 outcomes using colocalization analyses, which assess potential confounding by LD.
    Specifically, for each of these MR significant proteins with genome-wide summary data available, for the
    proteomic GWASs, a stringent Bayesian analysis was implemented in coloc R package to analyze all
    single nucleotide variants (SNV) with MAF > 0.01 in 1MB genomic locus centered on the cis-pQTL.
    Colocalizations with posterior probability for hypothesis 4 (PP4, that there is an association for both
    protein level and COVID-19 status and they are driven by the same causal variant) > 0.5 were considered
    likely to colocalize (which means the highest posterior probability for all 5 coloc hypotheses), and PP4 >
    0.8 was considered to be highly likely to colocalize.
