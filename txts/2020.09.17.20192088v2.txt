          Abstract
          Background Italy has been one of the countries most affected by the SARS-CoV-2
          pandemic and the regional healthcare system has had to quickly adapt its
          organization to meet the needs of infected patients. This has led to a drastic change
          in the routine management of non-communicable diseases with a potential long-term
          impact on patient health care. We investigated the management of non-COVID-19
          patients across all medical specialties during the pandemic in Italy.
          Methods A PRISMA guideline-based systematic review of the available literature
          was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus, restricting the search to the
          main outbreak period in Italy (from 20 February to 22 June, 2020). We selected
          articles in English or Italian that detailed changes in the Italian hospital care for non-
          COVID-19 patients due to the pandemic. Our keywords included all medical
          specialties in combination with our geographical focus (Italy) and COVID-19.
          Findings Of the 4643 potentially eligible studies identified by the search, 247 studies
          were included in the systematic review. A decrease in the management of
          emergencies in non-COVID patients was found together with an increase in
          mortality. Similarly, non-deferrable conditions met a tendency toward decreased
          diagnosis. All specialties have been affected by the reorganization of healthcare
          provision in the hub-and-spoke system and have benefited from telemedicine during
          the pandemic.
          Interpretation Our work highlights the changes taking place in the Italian public
          healthcare system in order to tackle the developing health crisis due to the COVID-
          19 pandemic. The findings of our review may be useful to analyze future directions
          for the healthcare system in the case of new pandemic scenarios.

          Introduction
          Since the first case of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan,
          China in December 2019, viral infection spread at an alarming rate worldwide. On
          January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described COVID-19 as a
          Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and by March 11, 2020, it was
          officially declared a pandemic.1 Italy was the first European country to be affected by
          COVID-19 with the first case being diagnosed on 20 February in a man living in the
          province of Lodi (NorthWest Italy).2 The epidemic went on to affect all regions in
          Italy, with higher incidence rates in the north. The peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in
          Italy was reached in the last week of March with over 5500 new cases per day.
          There has been a gradual decline since then as a result of strict containment
          measures that shaped the Italian lockdown phase. However, especially during the
          first phase of the epidemic, the outbreak put the Italian National Health System
          (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, SSN) under unprecedented pressure.
          In an attempt to direct the available resources at counteracting and limiting the
          effects of the pandemic, deferrable and non-urgent medical activities were
          suspended. On the other hand, patients with life-threatening conditions, such as
          myocardial infarction and stroke, or chronic conditions, such as diabetes, retained
          the right to their medical needs being met.
          In these circumstances, several medical domains have been constrained by different
          resource allocations with unpredictable long-term consequences on patient health
          care.3,4,5
          Here, we present a systematic review of the literature which illustrates the direct and
          indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of non-COVID
          patients across all medical specialties.
          Methods
          This systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.6 The
          search was conducted on 22 June 2020 on three different databases: PubMed,
          Embase, and Scopus without any date restriction. All the keywords were investigated
                                                                                                                                3

          within the title and abstract in both “AND” and “OR” combinations. Our keywords
          included all medical specialties (and potential synonyms) in combination with our
          geographical focus (Italy or Italian) and COVID-19. The full search strategy is
          reported in Table 1, Supplementary Material.
          Selection of the studies
          The literature search returned original papers published between 1979 and 2020 –
          especially for the keyword “coronavirus”. Since our focus was the novel severe acute
          respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the first positive case in Italy
          was detected on 20 February, the literature search was restricted to the period from
          20 February to 25 June, 2020. The databases were queried via an R script on their
          respective APIs, checked and cleaned for duplicates (via title, DOI and/or database
          id), and exported into Excel.
          In the second stage, studies were selected based on their titles and abstracts: each
          study was independently evaluated by three different raters (AnB, GA, GL). When
          there was a lack of agreement among the screeners, ensemble majority voting was
          used for the final decision. The full texts of the selected papers were thus analyzed
          by two reviewers in terms of relevance and inclusion/exclusion criteria (MMO and
          GA). When these reviewers disagreed over the inclusion or exclusion of a paper, a
          third reviewer was responsible for the final decision (GL). In addition, the reference
          lists of selected papers were reviewed in order to find pertinent studies not identified
          during the initial search.
          Inclusion and exclusion criteria
          The simultaneous co-occurrence of the following characteristics was considered for
          the inclusion of articles: (i) articles focusing on the SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19
          disease; (ii) articles focusing on the impact on patients based in Italy or on the Italian
          hospital organization; (iii) articles detailing COVID-19-associated changes in the
          Italian hospital care for non-COVID-19 patients. All the investigated articles were
          published in English or Italian.
          Type of studies
          Original papers, editorials, comments, research letters, case series and studies
          focusing on non-COVID patients in Italy were included.
                                                                                                                                4

          Data extraction and quality assessment
          Data were extracted from the papers by one of the investigators (TP) and were
          subsequently checked for accuracy by other reviewers (GL, AnB). Disagreements
          regarding data extraction among reviewers were solved by consensus. Extracted
          data included: type of medical specialty involved (surgical, medical, or public health),
          geographical location (north, south, centre or nationwide), type of patients
          (COVID/non-COVID), type of study (article or research letter/comment/editorial). No
          quality assessment was possible as over 32% of entries were not articles but
          consisted of comments, research letters, opinions or editorials – for which no quality
          guidelines are available.
          Investigated Outcomes
          This systematic review investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
          patients’ healthcare provision and hospital organization in Italy. Our primary goal was
          to identify potential short-term and long-term effects on the health of non-COVID
          patients. Our secondary goals were to identify: (i) organizational and/or clinical
          settings and decisions that were particularly effective (or counterproductive) during
          the pandemic; and (ii) similarities and differences across medical specialties and
          regional areas.
          Results
          The results are shown in Figure 1. After searching the databases, we identified a
          total of 4643 papers, from three different databases. Database merges and the
          removal of duplicate resulted in 1262 records, of which 100 were immediately
          removed as they were not related to COVID-19 (articles published before the
          pandemic in Italy). A total of 1162 records were then screened: 166 were removed
          as not relevant to Italy; 534 were removed as they referred to COVID-19 patients
          rather than non-COVID-19 patients. A total number of 247 were deemed eligible, of
          which 81 consisted of comments/letters/opinions/editorials.
          Oncology and radiotherapy were the most represented category (47 papers),
          followed by surgery (24 for general surgery, 9 for neurosurgery, 2 for cardio-surgery,
                                                                                                                                5

          2 for vascular surgery, and 3 further types), cardiology (19) and dermatology 14.
          There was one paper each for rheumatology and microbiology.
          Overall, 133 papers were related to clinical disciplines, 89 to surgery, and 24 to
          services. In terms of the geographical distribution, many papers provided general
          recommendations without a specific geographical identification (75). Lombardy was
          the most represented region (72), followed by Lazio (21) and Emilia Romagna (15).
          In the south, Campania was the most represented region (11), followed by Puglia
          (4). Marche, Piedmont and FVG had 7 papers each, Tuscany and Veneto 9 each.
          Overall, 73 were general/nationwide, 105 pertained to northern regions, 54 to central
          regions and 15 to southern regions and islands. The studies included are reported in
          Table 2, Supplementary Material.
          Management of emergencies
          In general, non-COVID patients admitted to emergency departments (ED) decreased
          and remained well below the standard levels7–11.The youngest age classes declined
          dramatically, whilst the oldest age classes progressively increased, remaining
          considerably above the standard rate of the local ED.8
          Table 1 shows the most relevant data regarding cardiovascular emergencies,
          including stroke. In northern Italy, the emergency gradually took over most of
          cardiology intensive care units (ICUs).9 As expected, the net effect of this
          reorganization was a significant reduction in sites and staff committed to the
          treatment of cardiovascular diseases.10–11 Comparing out-of-hospital cardiac arrests
          in the same period of the previous year, Baldi et al. found that the median arrival
          time of the emergency medical service was three minutes longer in 2020, and the
          proportion of patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation from bystanders
          was 15.6% lower. Among patients in whom resuscitation was attempted by
          emergency medical services, the incidence of out-of-hospital death was 14.9%
          higher in 2020 than in 2019.7 This finding was confirmed by additional studies
          highlighting an unpredictable decrease in acute coronary syndrome-related
          hospitalization in high-volume centres12,13,1415 and pacemaker implantation during the
          weeks following the COVID-19 outbreak.21–18
          Of note, one study showed a 49% reduction in acute heart failure admission to
          hospital.19 The patients admitted had longer door-to-balloon and symptoms to PCI
                                                                                                                                6

          times, higher hs-cTnI levels at presentation, lower residual LV function at discharge,
          and higher predicted late cardiovascular mortality on the GRACE score.13
          A lower number of patients with minor strokes and TIAs, longer onset-to-door and
          door-to-treatment times for major strokes, and reduced number of transfers from
          spokes centres were also reported.11,20 As a result, the number of patients who
          underwent intravenous thrombolysis or bridging therapy (combined intravenous and
          thrombectomy) decreased by −26% and −30%, respectively.
          In addition, as a consequence of the reduction in the patient eligibility for bridging
          therapy, the number of primary thrombectomies (performed with all the necessary
          personal protective equipment owing to the risk of infection21) increased by 41%.
          Most of these patients had very serious strokes that would have benefited from early
          diagnoses.22
          The decrease in hospital admissions, confirmed by a survey across multiple
          countries including Italy23,24, resulted in increased door-to-needle times and
          therapeutic windows being missed for patients suffering from severe strokes.25 More
          studies are needed to confirm these data and to evaluate the impact on death rates;
          however, recent reports from other countries seem to confirm this trend.26,27
          The reduction in available ICU beds, massively dedicated to COVID-19 patients with
          acute respiratory failure, and the fear of infection resulted in the shrinkage of surgical
          activities in all fields28–38 and a reduction in urgent endoscopic procedures in COVID-
          free hospitals.29
          Each sub-specialty defined various non- deferrable surgical procedures that had to
          be guaranteed, causing a drop in consultations requested by emergency
          departments as in the case of urgent urology.30 The surgical community were also
          faced with a shortage of blood components, derived from fewer donations due to
          lockdown and fear of infection.31 To compensate for the initial fall (−10%) in blood
          donations in the first week of March, the government promoted a national media
          campaign on the importance and safety of blood donation as a priority to maintain
          basic healthcare services for non-COVID patients.32 No blood-transmitted SARS-
          CoV-2 infection has been reported to date.33
          Children's emergency departments also showed a substantial decrease in visits.34
          This might reflect the scarcity of resources or the reluctance of parents and health
          care workers to expose children to the risk of viral infection in a health-care setting,
          in addition to lower rates of acute infections and trauma.35 However, this
                                                                                                                                7

          phenomenon has been detrimental to the health of non-COVID child patients: 12
          cases of delayed access to hospital care were reported during the week March 23–
          27 across five hospitals of an Italian Children's Hospital Research Network. Half of
          the children were admitted to an ICU and four died, highlighting the high risk of
          delaying access to hospital care.36 As a result, life-threatening conditions (i.e.
          abdominal pain, severe ketoacidosis) seemed to be more frequent, requiring in some
          cases an aggressive approach.35
          The same phenomenon affected dermatology37. Tartari et al. compared two different
          weeks, before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, showing a
          decrease in unjustified referrals (93% reduction) in dermatological emergency
          services.38
          Despite medical care for emergencies and urgent treatments being continuously
          provided throughout the pandemic, the lack of personnel, resources, and ICUs beds
          along with the patients' fear of being infected in hospital affected patient
          management and substantially delayed the provision of ordinary medical activities.
          These initial data seem to show a decrease in emergencies and an increase in
          mortality. We strongly suggest undertaking detailed studies to further explore this
          phenomenon.
          Management of non-deferrable conditions: the hub-and-spoke system
          To tackle the massive impact of the overflow of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients,
          hospitals in Italy had to undergo a significant reorganization.39–40 In order to manage
          conditions needing non-deferrable treatment while avoiding the risk of infection, hub-
          and-spoke centres were created and widely used throughout the country.50,55–58 In
          the hub-and-spoke model, a main campus or hub supplies the most intensive
          medical services, while satellite campuses or spokes offer more limited services at
          sites distributed across the neighbouring area.41
          Neurological surgery was particularly affected by the ICU reorganization, as it often
          requires a period of intensive monitoring in ICUs.22,60–62 All the cases of elective
          neurological surgery were deferred, while urgent neurosurgical pathologies (above
          all traumas) and non-deferrable tumour cases were transferred to hubs.27,29–33,61,67,68
          A specific urgency classification for tumour cases was developed based on
          symptoms, radiological findings, and suspected malignancy of the lesion.16,42–44
          Some minimal activities were still performed at spoke centres, only for very critical
                                                                                                                                8

          cases or when specific tools were required (i.e. gamma knife treatment of neoplastic
          lesions).16,42,45,46
          This provided an unprecedented opportunity for transversal collaboration among
          different teams, representing real innovation in such a competitive setting.58,64
          A hub-and-spoke system was also organized for vascular surgery and cardiac
          surgery units. All elective surgery was reduced and urgent surgery (including aortic
          aneurysms, valvular diseases or severe coronary diseases) was performed only in
          hub centres, preferring the endovascular to the open surgical approach whenever
          possible.70–72 A transcatheter approach was generally preferred, as it usually does
          not require an ICU bed or a ventilator.47
          The limitation of all non-urgent surgical activities also applied to general surgery73–78
          and obstetrics.48,49 In highly-infected areas (such as Lombardy), hub centres were
          created50 to treat only advanced symptomatic tumours81–83, while elective
          oncological surgery procedures continued to be performed in less affected
          regions.50,51 This was an important issue for oncological patients, especially older
          ones.85–88
          Many possible ways of minimizing the risks were proposed: to postpone treatments
          or elective surgery for stable cancer in endemic areas, to provide patients with
          greater personal protection, and to offer more intensive surveillance or
          treatment.52–54 For example, neoadjuvant treatments were recommended or
          increased55 to defer surgical admission for as long as possible.50,51,55,56 For other
          medical conditions requiring surgery under particular circumstances, such as relapse
          of inflammatory bowel disease, dedicated hubs were identified.94–57
          Interestingly, a tendency toward treatments aimed at reducing hospitalization was
          also found in medical oncology.58,59
          Some regions such as Tuscany created protocols for home care in order to avoid
          exposure to hospital settings.60 Oncological care delivery and cancer diagnosis100–102
          were dramatically reduced by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, even though suboptimal
          care and treatments may result in worse cancer‐related outcomes. Oncologists were
          thus asked to preserve the continuum of care of patients, while adopting mitigation
          strategies to reduce the likelihood of infection in all cancer patients.103–61
          Arduino et al. described a worrying delay in the diagnosis of oral cancer in north-
          west Italy during the Covid                       pandemic.62 Moreover, the cessation of elective

          activities, screening programs63, and the drastic reduction in services regarding
          breast cancer restricted evaluations to only clinical observations of palpable lesions
          with the elevated risk of missing new diagnoses.64, Although not requiring a
          structural reorganization, palliative care was forced to find a new balance between
          family member visits and patients’ needs.116–119
          In orthopaedics, the reorganization led to the identification of poly-specialist major
          trauma centres and specialistic referral centres for minor trauma or non-deferrable
          orthopedic surgeries (i.e. septic arthritis or malignant tumours).120–127 There was a
          reduction in the number of proximal femur fractures in two centres65, as well as a
          reduction in hip and knee arthroplasties.66
          A similar re-organization was also carried out for plastic surgery: only post-traumatic,
          oncological and burn treatments were guaranteed.130–132 A new approach based on
          enzymatic debridement was proposed for burns in order to reduce the need for burn
          surgery.67
          In urology, only urgent, non-deferrable procedures (colicky flank pain, gross
          hematuria and acute urinary retention) were authorized after careful multidisciplinary
          evaluation,134–138 which led to a drop in urological surgical activities.68 Whenever
          possible, alternative treatments not requiring general anaesthesia (i.e. radiotherapy
          for genitourinary cancers) were suggested as being preferable.69,70,71
          Oral and maxillofacial surgery72, otolaryngology73,74 and ophthalmology144–147 also
          suspended all non-urgent treatments, especially considering the high risk of infection
          of healthcare workers while manipulating the upper airways and eyes.75 Only the
          treatment          of     trauma,        malignant        neoplasms,       and      severe        infections     was
          guaranteed.142,149–152
          In the context of radiotherapy, all follow-up visits involved a phone call in advance in
          order to postpone non-urgent cases.153–156 The initial consultations of patients
          needing treatment for malignant tumours were conducted as normal157–159, as were
          certain treatments such as bone metastase radiotherapy.76 Specific approaches,
          such as short fractionated radiotherapy, were suggested.77
          All non-urgent and deferrable radiation treatments were delayed, while therapies for
          patients        with      a      better    prognosis       (benign     and     functional        diseases)      were
          postponed.78,79
          Dermatology departments were also involved in an extensive reorganization.80,81
          Dermatological anti-neoplastic treatments were provided in the dermatology clinics
                                                                                                                              10

          of many centres, such as Bologna82, Naples83, Modena84 and Ancona85, which also
          maintained urgent dermatological procedures and consultations required by other
          hospital wards. As awareness of the severity of the COVID-19 increased, some
          patients were concerned about continuing their medications, however all centres
          followed specific recommendations and advised patients not to suspend these drugs
          without consultation.170–173
          Lastly, microbiology labs underwent unprecedentedly high workloads with the
          increasing number of samples (swabs or serological tests) to analyze for the
          identification of Sar-Cov-2 infection. An extensive reorganization of the microbiology
          lab activities thus also occurred. In a large teaching hospital in Rome, the
          introduction of night shifts and the creation of a dedicated team significantly
          improved the number of samples processed, without interfering with the daily
          laboratory routines.86
          Hub-and-spoke centres represented an important change in care provision,
          especially in the most affected regions involving almost all specialties. However, data
          on the efficacy of this reorganization, measured in terms of health outcomes (such
          as mortality) are lacking. To date, only a few reports100,102,113 suggest a tendency
          toward a decrease in diagnosis for non-deferrable conditions despite the hub-and-
          spoke organization. Further epidemiological studies are needed to verify the
          emerging picture and to evaluate the impact on mortality rates.
          Replacement therapies: dialysis and transplantation
          Dialysis units experienced a profound change in their management, with the
          introduction of COVID-19 isolation rooms and the identification of dedicated
          healthcare professionals.87,88 Rombolà et al. proposed three actions to be taken in
          order to dialyze non-COVID patients safely: hygiene measures, the use of PPE to
          protect patients and the healthcare team, and the protection of the dialysis ward with
          an isolated area for testing patients suspected of infection.89
          In general, all transplant programs were profoundly affected by the pandemic.178–180
          First of all, the wall-to-wall screening of donors and recipients was established in
          order to identify positive patients that would not be able to donate or receive blood, in
          view of the high mortality rates of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients.78,180–
          183
               Secondly, the widespread reduction in available ICU beds led to an estimated
          15% drop in transplants compared with the average of the last five years90, such as
                                                                                                                              11

          liver transplantations.91 Transplantation was thus suggested only in true end-stage
          organ failure, preferring conservative treatments (maximizing pharmacological
          therapy) in all other patients.184,185,187
          Management of deferrable conditions and telemedicine
          The management of chronic conditions also suffered.92 Cesari et al. found that the
          integration of care services collapsed: admissions to post-acute/long-term care
          facilities were reduced and several person-tailored interventions were suspended –
          e.g., physical therapists for mobilization.93 Lasevoli et al. reinforced the view that the
          current pandemic has had dramatic consequences for the mental health of serious
          psychiatric patients.94 All this inevitably led to a drastic reduction and a substantial
          reorganization of the clinical activity in many specialties95 (Table 1), postponing
          elective treatments and switching to telemedicine (TM)96 for consultation or not to
          leave vulnerable high-need patients without proper follow-up228,234.
          The implementation of TM occurred in different ways and to varying degrees
          depending on the specific center and specialty. An online questionnaire administered
          to the 176 Directors of Italian Radiation Oncology Departments revealed that, to
          guarantee the continuity of care, telematic consultations for RT treatments were
          activated in 78 centres (62.4%)155. A similar survey for RT centres in Lombardy
          region revealed that 84% of RT facilities cancelled out-patient follow-up visits, 68%
          activated telematic consultation and 30% adopted working from home solutions156.
          Another survey administered to 122 medical oncology departments homogeneously
          distributed on the national territory, revealed that in 72% of cases alternative ways to
          get in touch with patients have been used, like telephonic interviews with
          interpretation of laboratory and radiologic examination reports. According to
          Pietrantonio et al., WhatsApp turned out to be adequate to give a rapid answer to
          most queries from oncologic patients108. Brunasso et al. started a teledermatologic
          service in smartworking using phone calls and emails by which could monitor almost
          94% of their patients234. In a Department of Urology in Northern Italy, 55% cases
          were screened undergoing telephone consultation253.
          TM has been shown to have beneficial impacts on heart failure outcomes in a
          comparative analysis between 2020 and 2019 by Salzano et al.200. Finally, TM
          positively impacted patients’ life as documented by a survey in which 85% of patients
          were satisfied with the remote interview modality and the reduction of economic and
                                                                                                                              12

          time costs related to going to the clinic. Most of those subjects (90%) expressed their
          willingness to continue to be included in remote evaluation programs228.
          TM consists in the distribution of health-related services and information via
          telecommunication technologies and represents an elective approach to managing
          deferrable conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Almost all specialties
          benefited from TM during the pandemic. In many cases, the short-term results have
          been particularly encouraging, although a longer follow-up is needed to assess the
          efficacy of these measures. The results are summarized in Table 2.
          TM has deeply influenced non-COVID patient care, enabling the remote diagnosis
          and monitoring of patients and allowing clinical data sharing between patients and
          physicians. However, the long-term effects on common health outcomes need to be
          carefully studied.97,98 Avoiding face-to-face contact via TM has been one of the most
          effective measures to limit the spread of SARS-Cov-2 infection, although many
          issues have been raised, such as privacy management and the lack of clear
          guidelines.194–198
          Discussion
          On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be
          a pandemic.1 However, Italy was already in lockdown, with decrees aimed at limiting
          mobility and strengthening the National Health System. On March 9, 202099, most
          outpatient services were temporarily suspended, except for a few treatments that
          were considered urgent and non-deferrable. Clinical support for early isolation,
          treatment, and, where needed, intensive care of COVID-19 patients (or suspect
          cases) became the priority, with a massive allocation of dedicated resources.
          A large increase in all-cause mortality was revealed during the epidemic, greater
          than the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 cases. The possible causes of
          this increase include the large number of severe undiagnosed COVID-19 cases, the
          reduced access to health services due to the disruption of normal working processes
          or due to the fear of contamination of sick patients affected by other diseases, and
          possibly other factors.100
                                                                                                                              13

          We provided a snapshot, across all medical specialties, of how the provision of
          treatments to non-COVID patients in Italy has been impacted by the shortage of
          resources imposed by the pandemic.
          Measures put in place to mitigate the outbreak, such as social distancing and
          confinement, contributed to discourage access to emergency department (ED) all
          over the country, also for those conditions requiring urgent care. As a result, there
          was a significant decrease in overall ED admissions and a substantial reduction in
          all-specialty surgical consultations.9-11 Cardiovascular emergencies payed significant
          tolls with a significant delay in time-sensitive emergency operations.9,19 More recent
          evidences, consistent with our results, showed a significant decrease in mean
          number of endovascular therapies per hospital performed before and after COVID-
          19 confinement along with a significant increase in mean stroke onset-to groin
          puncture time260.A delayed presentation of STEMI patients that may led to worsened
          prognosis and unnecessary deaths has also been observed261. Moreover, an
          additional study confirmed that more in-hospital cardiovascular deaths occurred in
          March 2020 compared with March 2019, a finding possibly due to late hospital
          presentations and consequent greater disease severity that affected eligibility and
          outcome of cardiovascular procedures262.
          As stated before, the hospitalization system was remodelled to allocate appropriate
          resources to manage patients with COVID-19; consequently, hubs were identified for
          specialized medical activities. Hub-and-spoke centres represented an important
          change in care provision, especially in the most affected regions, involving almost all
          specialties. However, data on the efficacy of this reorganization, measured in terms
          of health outcomes (such as mortality) are lacking. To date, only few reports100,102,113
          suggest a tendency toward a decrease in diagnosis for non-deferrable conditions
          despite the hub-and-spoke organization. Cautious and evidence-based studies are
          needed to properly assess the overall impact of this model on measurable outcomes.
          The hub-and-spoke system seems to be a valid model, at least, in the management
          of ischemic emergencies264; further epidemiological studies are needed to verify the
          emerging picture and to evaluate the impact on mortality rates.
          A pandemic is a dynamic scenario, requiring reorganization and flexibility of the
          healthcare delivery. TM, which consists in the distribution of health-related
          services and information via telecommunication technologies, proved a pragmatic
                                                                                                                              14

          approach to managing deferrable conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.
          TM has deeply influenced non-COVID patient care, enabling the remote diagnosis
          and monitoring of patients and clinical data sharing between patients and physicians
          with adequate protection for both. Moreover, TM allows for more flexibility on the
          side of both the clinician and the patient, as consultations can easily be rescheduled,
          and meetings can be held from home234.
          Almost all specialties benefited from TM during the pandemic, with short-term results
          particularly encouraging in some cases. In general, the pandemic has demonstrated
          that information technologies should be more promoted independently from this
          specific contex155. However, a longer follow-up is needed to assess the efficacy of
          these measures on common health outcomes97,98. Avoiding face-to-face contact via
          TM has been one of the most effective measures to limit the spread of SARS-Cov-2
          infection, although many issues have been raised, such as privacy management and
          the lack of clear guidelines.194–198 We strongly encourage to overcome these
          limitations to further promote the multiple opportunities of TM in tune with its pivotal
          role during the second phase of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy263.
          One limitation of this systematic review is the heterogeneity in publication type,
          which prevented the execution of a meta-analysis to summarize the findings together
          with a quality assessment. Another important issue is the potential underreporting,
          although the studies did cover experiences from the whole country.
          Our work thus suggests that a public health crisis has resulted from the pandemic, a
          concern raised in other countries too, such as France.259 More detailed, population-
          based studies are needed to assess whether emergency management benefited
          from the reorganization adopted. Nevertheless, the hub-and-spoke system and
          telemedicine undoubtedly played – and continue to play – a crucial role in dealing
          with non-deferrable and deferrable conditions, respectively.
