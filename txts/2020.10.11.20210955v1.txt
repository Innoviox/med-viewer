   The link between CS gas exposure and menstrual cycle issues among female
                                          Yellow Vest protesters in France

  Abstract
  CS teargas is one of the most used tools for crowd-control worldwide. Exposure to CS teargas
  is known to have consequences on protesters’ health (i.e. eye, skin irritation, respiratory
  problems), but recent concerns have been raised over its potential gender-specific effects.
  Indeed, field and clinical observations report cases of menstrual cycle issues among female
  protesters following high exposure to teargas. The hypothesis of a link between teargas
  exposure and menstrual cycle issues is plausible from a physiological standpoint, but has not
  yet been empirically investigated. Using data from a cross-sectional study on Yellow Vests
  protesters’ health in France, we examined the relationship between exposure to teargas and
  menstrual cycle issues among female protesters (n = 145). Analyses suggested a positive link
  between exposure and menstrual cycle perturbations. These results constitute first and
  preliminary evidence that CS teargas may be linked with menstrual cycle among women,
  which need corroboration given the importance of this issue. We call for further research on
  the potential effects of CS teargas on women’s reproductive system.

                                                        1. INTRODUCTION
  A surge in mass protests has been observed throughout the world over the past two years. From
  the Yellow Vest in France (Jetten, Mols, & Selvanathan, 2020) to the Hong-Kong anti-
  extradition bill and the more recent ‘George Floyd’ protests in the US, a common thread has
  been the level of police response deployed by governments. More specifically, these responses
  made use of crowd control techniques relying on various weapons, which can have tremendous
  effects on protesters’ health. For instance, kinetic weapons (i.e. rubber pellet ammunition
  launchers) were found to cause severe ocular injuries, sometimes leading to permanent loss of
  eyesight (Chauvin et al., 2019). Stun grenades and other explosive devices used to disperse
  crowds have caused mutilation and loss of hands among protesters (Jetten et al., 2020; Paye,
  2019). Likewise, it has recently been acknowledged that police use of force and less-lethal
  weapons could have deleterious effects on participants’ mental health (Celebi, Adam-Troian,
  & Mahfud, 2020)
            Among the different tools available to law enforcement the most widely used remains
  Ortho-Chlorobenzylidene Malononitrile, also simply known as CS teargas or teargas. As an
  example, more than 16,000 rounds of teargas were fired during the 2019 Hong Kong protests
  (Standard, 2019). In Paris, France, 7940 teargas grenades have been used in a single day of
  December 1st 2018 during the Yellow Vest protests (Rocher, 2020). Despite its widespread use
  by law enforcement, tear gas comprises many known health hazards, with scientists calling for
  restriction of its use (Haar, Iacopino, Ranadive, Weiser, & Dandu, 2017; Kaszeta, 2019;
  Rothenberg, Achanta, Svendsen, & Jordt, 2016). Cutaneous effects vary from transient rash and
  erythema to severe allergic dermatitis (Varma & Holt, 2001) with second to third degree burns
  (Zekri, King, Yeung, & Taylor, 1995). Eye damage includes corneal edema, keratitis, glaucoma
  and even cataract (Gray & Murray, 1995; Hout, White, Stubner, Stevens, & Knapik, 2014). On
  the respiratory tract, effects vary from cough to airway obstruction with hemoptysis (Dagli,

  Uslu, Ozkan, Torlak , & Arbak, 2014) and damage induces higher susceptibility to acute
  respiratory inflammations (Hout et al., 2014), which is of high concern during COVID-19
  pandemic.
            Besides these general consequences of teargas on the organism, there are reasons to
  suspect that gender specific effects may occur - which remain understudied. More specifically,
  recent concerns have been raised about teargas’ potential effect on the female menstrual cycle.
  Reports from recent press releases indicate that these concerns are more than simple public
  rumor (Anizon, 2019) and a survey study run by Planned Parenthood North Central States and
  the University of Minnesota was started this year (Hassan, 2020) to assess whether teargas may
  affect female protesters’ menstrual cycle in particular (longer or shorter cycles). Indeed, clinical
  observations of increases in miscarriages and stillbirths after tear gas exposure have been
  reported in Gaza (Hu et al., 1989) and in Bahrain (Atkinson & Sollom, 2012). Concerns over
  potential miscarriages have led some countries to suspend the use of teargas, like Chile in 2011
  (Rothenberg et al., 2016; also see Hayman, 2011).
            Still, the current level of evidence for a link between CS teargas and
  menstrual/reproductive perturbations is low, although the hypothesis remains physiological
  plausible. In fact, a pathway leading to these symptoms based on CS metabolism into cyanide
  (Frankenberg & Sorbo, 1973) after absorption (Leadbeater, 1973) or direct cyanide exposure
  after thermal degradation (Johnson-Kanapathy, 2013) was recently proposed (Samuel et al.,
  2020). Although this hypothesis has not yet been tested, teargas could affect women’s menstrual
  cycle through a molecular dysfunction due to decreased blood level oxygen (a consequence of
  increased cyanide blood levels). This would be consistent with studies showing that hypoxia
  leads to impaired menstrual cycle among humans (Maybin et al., 2018).
            In addition, injection of CS in rodents was found to increase blood thiocyanate (the final
  product of cyanide in the metabolism (Ballantyne, 1983). Thiocyanate being a perturbator

    of the thyroid function (Dohan, De la Vieja, & Carrasco, 2000), and thyroid dysfunction being
    related to menstrual disorders (Ajmani et al., 2016), this could be another pathway through
    which teargas may affect women’s menstrual cycle. Converging evidence also suggests that
    other teargas affected molecular mechanisms could trigger menstrual cycle impairment, either
    due to byproducts or to a potential endocrine disruptive effect of teargas (Nelson, Wang,
    Sakwari, & Ding, 2020). In sum, various physiological mechanisms triggered by teargas could
    - theoretically - act or interact to produce perturbations on the female menstrual cycle.
              Despite growing concerns, mounting clinical evidence and biological plausibility, the
    potential effect of CS teargas on female menstrual cycle has - to the best of our knowledge -
    not been investigated yet. We therefore decided to test whether teargas exposure could be
    associated with menstrual cycle perturbations among female protesters. To do so, we took
    advantage of data collected from a study on protester health and social behavior just before the
    beginning of the covid-19 crisis. We hypothesized that levels of teargas exposure among female
    protesters would be positively associated with prevalence of menstrual cycle perturbation
    symptoms.

2.2. Participants and procedure
          Our data comes from a larger cross-sectional study assessing the various effects of crowd
    control techniques on protesters’ health and behavior in France. In this context, we aimed to
    collect data from a sample of individuals involved in the Yellow Vests protests, albeit limited
    to those individuals able to access online information and to participate in online surveys. To
    ensure stable parameter estimates, we estimated that at least 250 respondents were needed
    (Schönbrodt & Perugini, 2013).
          Links to an online survey were disseminated on Yellow Vests social media pages by the
    investigators. Leaders of the movement and administrators of webpages and forums dedicated
    to the Yellow Vests were also asked to voluntarily help disseminate survey links. Data
    collection started in February of 2020. Investigators frequently monitored the sample size and
    were instructed to stop collection when the expected sample size of at least 250 Yellow Vest
    participants was reached. In march of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic started in France and data
    collection was thus interrupted to avoid bias. Therefore, the survey contained responses from
    215 self-identified Yellow Vests (67.8% female; M = 47.6, SD = 11.2), who attended 26.3
                                                                             age
    Yellow Vests protests on average (SD = 26.2). Among them, our final sample for the current
    study is made of the n = 145 women who responded to the survey (M = 48.6, SD = 10.2), who      age
    attended 23.8 protests on average (SD = 23.4).
2.3 Materials
          The survey contained two parts, one epidemiological and one psychosocial, for different
    studies and investigative purposes. The psychosocial part of the survey included measures
    related to political attitudes and protest behavior. The epidemiological part of the survey
    examined in this study contained measures of health, medical antecedents, mental health as well

  as a specific part related to exposure to teargas and teargas-related symptoms. Among them, we
  used the following measures:
        Exposure to teargas. A single item measure was used to assess the extent to which
  participants had been exposed to teargas. The item asked how often participants had been
  exposed to teargas in the protests (0 = ‘Never’, 1 = ‘Less than 5 times’, 2 = ‘Between five to ten
  times’, 3 = ‘More than 10 times’; Median = 2). Overall, 19.6% (n = 28) of the participants were
  never exposed to teargas , 21% (n = 30) less than five times, 14.7% (n = 21) between five and
  ten times and 44.8% (n = 64) more than ten times.
        Teargas-specific symptoms. Irritating effects, achieved through transient receptor potential
  ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) receptors stimulation (Lindsay et al., 2015) are mainly on the skin, eyes and
  respiratory tract (Schep, Slaughter, & McBride, 2015). Cyanide effects are those of hypoxia,
  causing headaches, dizziness, confusion, coma or even death (L. Nelson, 2006). Oxidative
  stress caused by cyanide poisoning can turn into long lasting effects on liver, kidneys and brain
  (Bhattacharya, Singh, John, & Gujar, 2018). These teargas specific symptoms (ranging from
  eye burn to nausea and heart problems; n = 15) were measured by asking participants if they
  experienced any of those following exposure to teargas. Furthermore, participants were asked
  to indicate if they experienced these symptoms directly after exposure (short term) or if these
  still persisted a few days after exposure (long term). From these, we computed scores of total
  reported (M = 7.13, SD = 5.18) and long-term only symptoms (M = 2.92, SD = 3.56) following
  teargas exposure.
        Gender-specific symptoms. Similarly, participants were then asked to report whether they
  had experienced any short (M = 18.6%) or long-term (M = 15.2%) ‘anomalous menstrual
  cycle’. This single item measure was used to test our hypothesis.

        Health-related covariates. To rule out potential confounds, we decided to run robustness
  checks including health factors that may affect menstrual cycles. First, we decided to include a
  measure of participants’ general health, as measured by a sum score of their self-reported
  medical antecedents. These were asked as a series of yes/no questions probing allergies
  (Oertelt-Prigione, 2012), heart (Canoy et al., 2015) and respiratory (Macsali et al., 2013)
  conditions, sight, digestive or neurological problems as well as mental health and sleep issues
  (Zukov et al., 2010) (M = 2.37, SD = 1.71). In addition, we assessed participants’ tobacco (M =
  3.69, SD = 2.80) and alcohol (M = .93, SD = 1.08) consumption ( 0 = ‘Never’, 1 =
  ‘Occasionally’, 2 = ‘At least once a week’, 3 = ‘Everyday’) . Overall 58.7% of the participants
  reported to consume tobacco daily and 2.8% alcohol.
        Demographics. Finally, participants were asked to report their monthly income bracket (7
  levels from 0 = ‘No income’ to 6 = ‘€2500 and above’, Median = 3, ‘between the minimum
  wage and €1500’) and diploma (7 levels from 0 = ‘None’ to 6 = ‘PhD and above’, Median = 2,
  ‘highschool graduate’). Participants characteristics according to their exposure group can be
  found in table 1.
                                                           3. RESULTS
  3.1. Preliminary analyses
        Point-biserial and Pearson correlations were computed to investigate the links between our
  measures. Results can be seen in table 2 and highlight, as expected, substantial associations
  between teargas exposure and both total r(144) = .54, p < .001 and long-term symptom scores,
  r(144) = .35, p < .001. Furthermore - and providing support for our hypothesis - exposure to
  teargas was also positively associated with both total r(144) = .20, p = .018 and long-term
  menstrual cycle perturbations, r(144) = .17, p = .044.

  3.2. Main analysis
            Although results from correlational analyses were encouraging, we needed to see if the
  association between teargas exposure and menstrual cycle perturbations held when using
  optimal analytical procedures (here logistic regression). As can be seen from table 3, logistic
  regression models confirmed the presence of a link between exposure to teargas and menstrual
  cycle perturbations, in general, O.R. = 1.62, 95%CI[1.10,2.52], p = .022, and for long term
  symptoms, O.R. = 1.56, 95%CI[1.03,2.53], p = .049 - albeit weaker. We also ran the models
  again adjusting for all health related covariates and demographics. Although none of the
  covariates were substantially linked with the outcome (all ps > .10), they did affect our main
  results, O.R. = 1.48, 95%CI[0.95,2.46], p = .088 for long-term, O.R. = 1.52, 95%CI[0.99,2.41],
  p = .061 for total menstrual cycle perturbations. This was most likely due to our small sample
  size and variability in the data, which rendered models sensitive to addition of unnecessary dfs.

            Could CS teargas exposure trigger menstrual perturbations among female protesters?
  This very first analysis suggests that teargas could be linked with menstrual cycle perturbations
  up to a few days after exposure. It is important to note that the present research is the first to
  attempt a thorough investigation of the teargas-menstrual perturbations hypothesis. However,
  this first study cannot account for processes and or mechanisms, so the issue of knowing
  whether this association may be due to the psychological or physiological effects of teargas, as
  described in the introduction, remains completely open. In fact, stress is known to be related to
  menstrual cycle disturbance (Huhmann, 2020; Xiao & Ferin, 1997). Protests, in which tear gas
  is used, are a very stressful event which can even lead to depression or posttraumatic stress
  disorder (Adam-Troian, Çelebi, & Mahfud, 2020; Celebi et al., 2020). Thus, it is possible that
  psychological effects cause menstrual disorders in protesters exposed to tear gas.
            Another possibility would be that both psychological and physiological effects work
  together in causing observed symptoms. It is therefore important to better characterize more
  accurately when the female menstrual cycle is actually affected after exposure to tear gas, and
  to what extent these effects are related to physiological or psychological mechanisms. Of note,
  symptoms related to acute panic disorder include respiratory gasp and dizziness, therefore it is
  difficult to distinguishing them from lesser cyanide intoxications (Borden Institute, 2009)
  which can occur after exposure to CS teargas (Johnson-Kanapathy, 2013). Further studies
  should include more detailed measures of both exposure and symptoms (e.g. not only menstrual
  cycle anomalies in terms of duration but also painfulness, aspect, quantity…) which may help
  clarify the mechanisms at play.
            Despite these theoretical limitations, the statistical associations detected by our models
  seemed robust, which is encouraging. Still, these were sensitive to the introduction of
  supplementary variables in the models, which we believe is due to various methodological
  reasons. First and foremost, our study was limited by sample size, due to data collection issues

  and this seriously limited our power and thus ability to detect small to medium effects such as
  the ones we found here (Baker et al., 2020). The ‘rare’ nature of our target population (very
  active Yellow Vests protesters) made it difficult to access participants. Moreover, we believe
  that our measures for both teargas exposure and menstrual cycle-related perturbations were
  limited (only four categories for the former, only one item for both). This probably explains the
  variability observed on sample average responses, and made it more difficult to detect our
  effects.
            In addition to this detection problem, we would like to invite caution when interpreting
  the present findings. If these results are encouraging, they constitute preliminary and pioneer
  evidence in need of confirmatory studies. In fact, we do not claim the statistical association we
  found to have causal implication, especially due to the cross-sectional nature of our study. In
  addition, our sample is specific (Female Yellow Vests protesters in France), which means that
  generalizability beyond French protesters may not be guaranteed (Henrich, Heine, &
  Norenzayan, 2010). Finally, we cannot exclude that our results may be biased due to traditional
  limitations of self-report methods, although this may be truer for prevalence numbers (i.e.
  averages) than for associations between our constructs.
            Within the boundaries of the above-mentioned limitations, we argue that this study
  provided first evidence to warrant further investigation of the potentially detrimental effect of
  teargas on women’s menstrual cycle and reproductive functions. We call for urgent
  epidemiological research to confirm or infirm whether these gender specific effects of teargas
  may occur, and to quantify them using larger samples of female protesters and more robust (i.e.
  longitudinal) designs.
