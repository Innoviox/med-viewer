21     Abstract: Current diagnostic methods used to evaluate patients with pharyngitis for the presence
22     of group A Streptococcus (GAS) do not discriminate between acute infection and asymptomatic
23     carriage, potentially resulting in overuse of antibiotics. We hypothesized that host response as
24     measured by the transcriptomic profile of peripheral blood leukocytes could make this
25     distinction, and could also distinguish between GAS and viral infection. We used RNA
26     sequencing to generate whole blood transcriptomes from 37 children, including 10 with acute
27     GAS pharyngitis, 5 with asymptomatic GAS carriage, 3 with adenoviral pharyngitis, 3 with
28     pharyngitis of unknown etiology, and 16 asymptomatic children negative for GAS.
29     Transcriptional profiles from children with symptomatic GAS, GAS carriage, symptomatic
30     adenoviral pharyngitis, and controls were each distinct. Of 15,185 genes with analyzable
31     sequence, 1357 (8.9%) were differentially expressed in the children with symptomatic GAS
32     compared to those with asymptomatic carriage, and 1336 (8.8%) compared to symptomatic
33     adenovirus infection. A panel of 13 genes distinguished between children with acute GAS and all
34     others with 91% accuracy. The gene encoding CD177, a marker of neutrophil activation, had a
35     152-fold increase in expression in children with acute GAS, and is a potential diagnostic
36     biomarker. We conclude that measurement of host response is highly promising to improve the
37     diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis and could help limit unnecessary antibiotic use.

39     Introduction
40     Pharyngitis is one of the most common reasons for acute medical care visits. According to the
41     National Ambulatory Care Survey, there were more than 10 million visits to physicians for
42     “symptoms related to throat” in 2016, the most recent year for which data are available (1).
43     Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial cause of acute pharyngitis,
                                                                          2

44     accounting for 5-15% of sore throat visits in adults and 20-30% in children (2, 3). Recognition of
45     GAS pharyngitis is important because appropriate antibiotic therapy can prevent progression to
46     acute rheumatic fever, shorten the period of the acute illness, prevent local complications, and
47     limit transmission (4). Most cases of pharyngitis not caused by GAS are caused by viruses such
48     as adenovirus (AdV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and do not respond to antibiotic therapy.
49     Because clinical findings do not clearly distinguish between GAS and viral pharyngitis (5),
50     clinical management relies heavily on diagnostic testing (6), Until recently, the diagnostic tools
51     employed were rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) and culture. RADTs are highly specific for
52     detection of GAS but are less sensitive than culture (7, 8). Thus, the common clinical algorithm
53     in children has been a 2-step approach that starts with a RADT, followed by a culture if the
54     RADT is negative (2, 3, 6). A disadvantage of the 2-step approach is that culture requires 48
55     hours of incubation before it can be finalized, leading to delayed treatment in some patients and
56     requiring additional contacts with health care providers to learn the test results.
57     Recently rapid molecular tests for detection of GAS have been cleared by the Food and Drug
58     Administration for use in clinical practice. These tests use the polymerase chain reaction or other
59     nucleic acid amplification methods, have sensitivity comparable to or exceeding that of culture,
60     and can be performed in 30 minutes or less (9-15). Some of the test methods have waived status
61     under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). The simplicity, rapidity, and
62     sensitivity of these tests suggest that they may be used without back-up culture, thus greatly
63     simplifying the clinical approach to the patient with pharyngitis by converting the 2-step
64     algorithm to 1-step. Clinical studies to validate this approach have not yet been published as of
65     this writing, and professional societies have not yet released definitive recommendations for
66     incorporating molecular rapid strep tests into practice.

67     A weakness of any diagnostic approach for GAS that relies on direct detection of the organism or
68     its components is the common occurrence of asymptomatic colonization (also referred to as the
69     carrier state), especially in children, who are also at greatest risk for symptomatic GAS. A recent
70     meta-analysis reported that GAS carriage was present in 12% of well children (16). The
71     frequency of carriage is lower in children less than 5 years of age (16, 17) and in adults (17).
72     Antibiotic therapy is not indicated for carriers, and failure to distinguish between symptomatic
73     infection and carriers can be diagnostically misleading and result in unnecessary antibiotic
74     related to treating carriers with symptomatic viral infection. The magnitude of this problem is
75     underscored by a recent estimate that 1.5 million cases of GAS carriage are present in individuals
76     with pharyngitis in the US (18), potentially translating into a large volume of unnecessary
77     antibiotic usage.
78     In recent years, assessment of host response, at either the transcriptomic or the proteomic level,
79     has been widely evaluated as a potential method for enhancing infectious disease diagnosis. We
80     and others have demonstrated that transcriptional analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes can
81     distinguish accurately between bacterial and viral infections (19-22). In addition, host response
82     can distinguish between symptomatic infection and asymptomatic colonization. For example,
83     we recently showed that host gene expression distinguishes between symptomatic and
84     asymptomatic viral respiratory infection (23). Because both of these capabilities – distinguishing
85     between bacterial and viral infection and between symptomatic and asymptomatic infection – are
86     required for accurate diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis, we undertook a study to apply
87     transcriptomic analysis to cases of acute pharyngitis. An appealing aspect of evaluating host
88     response in acute pharyngitis is that specimens to achieve an accurate microbial assessment of
89     pharyngitis can be readily obtained. This is in contrast to most other sites within the respiratory
                                                                          4

 90     tract such as sinusitis, otitis media, or pneumonia in which accurate microbial diagnosis requires
 91     an invasive procedure to collect an adequate sample. Here we used bacterial cultures and
 92     molecular tests to establish microbial etiology, thus providing a firm basis for evaluating the
 93     diagnostic accuracy of the transcriptomic response.

 95     Results
 96
 97     Subjects: We enrolled 40 subjects, including 18 cases with pharyngitis and 22 asymptomatic
 98     controls. No samples were obtained from one control subject, leaving 18 cases and 21 controls
 99     for analysis. Demographic characteristics of cases and controls are shown in Table 1. Compared
100     to controls, cases were younger (median years 10.5 vs 13.1), more likely to be female (83% vs
101     57%) and more likely to be Black (83% vs 71%).
102     Microbial testing: Results of microbial testing for GAS, AdV, other viruses, and other bacteria
103     are shown in Fig. 1 and Table S1. Subjects were considered positive for GAS if GAS was
104     detected by either culture or nucleic acid testing (NAT). Using this definition, 11 (61%) of the 18
105     cases and 5 (24%) of the 21 controls were positive for GAS including 7 cases and 3 controls with
106     positive cultures. Throat culture and Strep NAT results for each subject are shown in Tables S2
107     and S3.
108     AdV was detected in 4 cases and in 1 control. The 4 cases included 2 that were positive only for
109     AdV, 1 that was positive for AdV and RV, and 1 that was positive for AdV and Streptococcus
110     dysgalactiae.
                                                                           5

111     Respiratory viruses other than AdV were detected in 2 cases and in 2 controls. Serologic
112     evidence of current or recent EBV infection was found in 1 case and 1 control, both of whom
113     were also positive for GAS. Thirteen controls were negative for viruses or bacteria.
114     Clinical subgroups: For purposes of analysis, subjects were classified into 6 clinical subgroups
115     shown with color codes in Fig. 1. Subgroups of symptomatic subjects were: symptomatic GAS
116     (sGAS, n=11), symptomatic AdV (sAdV, n=3), and symptomatic “other pharyngitis” (sOP, n=4).
117     One symptomatic subject who was positive for AdV and grew Streptococcus dysgalactiae on a
118     throat culture was classified as sOP because of uncertainty about the relative roles of the two
119     pathogens that are each recognized as causes of symptomatic pharyngitis. Subgroups of
120     asymptomatic controls were: asymptomatic GAS (asGAS, n=5), virus-positive controls (vCtrl,
121     n=3), and virus-negative controls (nCtrl, n=13). One subject with symptomatic GAS and one
122     subject with symptomatic AdV infection were each also positive for RV. We classified these
123     subjects as sGAS and sAdV respectively because RV is not recognized as a cause of severe
124     pharyngo-tonsillitis and therefore was most likely not an etiologic agent in these cases. One
125     subject with symptomatic GAS and one control subject who was a GAS carrier were each
126     positive for EBV IgM. We classified the symptomatic subject as sGAS and the control subject as
127     asGAS because there was no evidence of clinically significant EBV infection in either case.
128     Demographic characteristics of each of the subgroups are shown in Table 1.
129     White blood cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT): Total white blood
130     cell (WBC) counts, percent mature neutrophils, CRP, and PCT for the sGAS, sAdV, asGAS,
131     vCtrl and nCtrl subgroups are shown in Fig. 2. For this analysis, vCtrl and nCtrl were combined
132     as “controls”. WBC counts, percent mature neutrophils, CRP, and PCT were higher in subjects
133     with sGAS compared to the other groups. Differences in each clinical test between sGAS and
                                                                           6

134     asGAS and between sGAS and nCtrl were statistically significant. Differences in CRP and PCT
135     between sGAS and sAdV were also statistically significant and the difference in WBC was of
136     borderline significance.
137     Gene expression profiles distinguishing symptomatic cases and asymptomatic controls: Blood
138     samples yielded analyzable sequence data for 37 subjects including 16 cases and 21 controls (the
139     2 subjects with non-analyzable sequence data are designated in Fig. 1). We first examined the 37
140     gene expression profiles to identify significant DEG that would provide accurate and unbiased
141     classification of symptomatic versus asymptomatic subjects. For this analysis, DEG were defined
142     as genes with a ≥2-fold change in expression level with a false discovery rate (Q) <0.05.
143     Comparisons of sGAS, sAdV, and sOP each versus nCtrl yielded a total of 1464 DEG (Fig. 3A).
144     Analysis of the DEG using unsupervised hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance and
145     Ward’s method separated the 37 subjects into 2 distinct major clusters designated Cluster 1 and
146     Cluster 2 (Fig. 3B). Cluster 1 consisted of all 16 symptomatic subjects plus 2 controls (1 asGAS
147     and 1 nCtrl). Cluster 2 consisted of the remaining 19 asymptomatic subjects. Seven of 10 sGAS
148     cases were clustered tightly within Cluster 1. Clusters of genes that were generally upregulated
149     in sGAS, upregulated in sAdV, and downregulated in sGAS were apparent (Fig. 3B). We also
150     investigated the effect of excluding 3 subjects who were positive for a respiratory virus or EBV
151     in addition to GAS (boxes B,C,J). As shown in Fig. S1, excluding these subjects had only a
152     minor impact on the detection of DEG.
153     Distinct gene expression profiles of clinical subgroups: To begin a process of defining gene
154     expression profiles characteristic of each clinical subgroup, we identified genes of interest by
155     comparing each of the subgroups (other than sOP) to nCtrl, selecting DEG with fold change ≥2.0
156     with P < 0.05. By using a cutoff of P <0.05 (without correction for multiple comparisons), we
                                                                           7

157     were able to identify a workable number of DEG for the purpose of defining preliminary gene
158     expression profiles for downstream classification and biological pathway analyses, as these
159     analyses are based upon clustered/co-regulated but not individual genes. The number of DEG
160     identified in each comparison is shown in Fig. 4A. The largest group of DEG were from the
161     comparison of sGAS versus nCtrl (1334 DEG), followed by the comparison of sAdV versus
162     nCtrl (508 DEG). Comparisons of asGAS and vCtrl versus nCtrl yielded much smaller numbers
163     of DEG. In all, the union of the 4 sets of DEG comprised a total of 1864 unique DEG. Gene
164     expression profiles for the 6 clinical subgroups generated using supervised hierarchical
165     clustering applied to the 1864 DEG are shown in Fig. 4B. Clear differences were evident
166     between sGAS and sAdV, each of which also differed from the asymptomatic controls.
167     Expression profiles of the 3 subgroups of asymptomatic controls were similar to one another,
168     indicating that the presence of GAS or a virus in these asymptomatic control subjects did not
169     have a strong impact on their gene expression profile. Within the control subgroups, 3 outlier
170     profiles were evident: P021 whose true class was asGAS had a profile that resembled that of
171     sGAS, and P003 whose true class was vCtrl (positive for AdV) had a profile that resembled that
172     of sAdV. These results suggest that even though these subjects were asymptomatic, they were
173     experiencing a host response to the presence of the respective organism. P024 whose true class
174     was nCtrl had a profile resembling that of sGAS, suggesting that despite negative tests for GAS,
175     the subject may have had a recent infection with GAS. CRP and PCT were not elevated in any of
176     the 3 subjects, nor was WBC, which was measured in 2 of the 3. Including or excluding these 3
177     subjects from the overall analysis of gene expression profiles had minimal effect on the overall
178     pattern of results or on the clustering of subjects (Fig. S2).

179     Gene expression profiles of subjects with other pharyngitis: Inspection of the expression profiles
180     of the 3 subjects with sOP provided clues to their etiology which were not evident in their
181     clinical evaluations. Subject P022 had a peritonsillar abscess without a specific microbiologic
182     diagnosis. This patient had findings including a markedly elevated white blood cell count
183     (19,900 per microliter) with 78% mature neutrophils and an elevated CRP of 214 mg/dL that
184     strongly suggesting bacterial infection, although procalcitonin was not elevated. The gene
185     expression profile resembled that of the subjects with sGAS (Fig. 3B and 4B and D). Subject
186     P019 had findings suggestive of a viral infection, including a normal white blood cell count with
187     46% mature neutrophils, a modestly elevated CRP of 43.6 mg/dL, and a borderline procalcitonin
188     value of 0.15 ng/mL. This subject’s gene expression profile strongly resembled those of subjects
189     with sAdV (Fig. 2), suggesting that the subject may have had an unrecognized AdV infection.
190     Subject P026 had normal white blood cell count, percent mature neutrophils, CRP, and PCT,
191     suggesting that this patient had a viral infection or had a non-infectious cause of their
192     pharyngitis. The gene expression profile that did not closely resemble that of any of the other
193     clinical subgroups.
194     Gene classifiers for GAS: Because our ultimate goal was to find gene classifiers to distinguish
195     sGAS from all other subgroups, we carried out another round of analysis in which we examined
196     DEG as defined above resulting from comparisons of sGAS versus sAdV, asGAS, vCtrl, and
197     nCtrl. The results are shown in Fig. 4C. From this set of comparisons, we identified a set of 535
198     common DEG that distinguished sGAS from each of the other subgroups. Supervised
199     hierarchical clustering of these genes for each of the 6 clinical subgroups resulted in the profiles
200     shown in Fig. 4D. As shown, the expression profile of sGAS was clearly different from the other
201     groups, with a large number of upregulated genes in the subjects with sGAS. Of note, the 2
                                                                           9

202     asymptomatic subjects (P021 and P024) and one subject with sOP (P022) described previously
203     as having gene expression profiles similar to that of sGAS had corresponding profiles in this
204     analysis that were even more strongly suggestive of sGAS.
205     Selection and performance of classifiers: To identify gene classifiers, we applied a shrunken
206     centroid-based model system (Prediction Analysis of Microarray [PAM]) (24) to the set of 535
207     DEG that were uniquely up- or down-regulated in sGAS. This analysis yielded classifier panels
208     comprising 5-14 genes with expression profiles that accurately distinguished sGAS from each of
209     the other clinical subgroups (excluding sOP). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
210     evaluating performance of the panels in distinguishing sGAS from each of the other subgroups
211     are shown in Fig. 5, and ROC curves for 8 other comparisons are shown in Fig. S3. The genes
212     included in each panel are listed in Table S4. In addition to defining panels that distinguished
213     sGAS from the other individual subgroups, we also identified a panel of 13 genes that
214     distinguished sGAS from all other subgroups. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for this
215     clinically important comparison was 0.93. We performed a similar analysis for 3 of the 4 clinical
216     tests used to characterize the cases (WBC, percent mature neutrophils, and CRP). PCT could not
217     be included in this analysis because quantitative values were not available for negative results.
218     AUCs were 0.914 for WBC, 0.869 for percent mature neutrophils, and 0.865 for CRP. The AUC
219     for the 3 clinical tests used together was 0.870 (Table S5).
220     Individual classifier gene with highest performance: Fig. 6 shows fold-changes in gene
221     expression and corresponding heat maps for the classifier genes making up the panels used to
222     distinguish sGAS from other subgroups. In each of the 5 comparisons, CD177 had the highest
223     fold-change of any of the classifier genes. For example in the comparison of sGAS to nCtrl,
224     CD177 was upregulated 217.5-fold, with the next most elevated gene (FCGR1A) upregulated
                                                                           10

225     10.7-fold. Likewise, in the comparison of sGAS to asGAS, CD177 was upregulated 152.9-fold,
226     with the next most upregulated gene (ARG1) upregulated 13.4-fold. To further characterize the
227     performance of CD177 as a classifier, we compared CD177 counts per million reads in subjects
228     with sGAS compared to the other clinical subgroups, and found no overlap (Fig. 7, Panel A).
229     Fig. 7, Panel B shows the ROC curve evaluating the performance of CD177 in distinguishing
230     between sGAS and the other clinical subgroups (excluding sOP). The AUC was 0.996. To
231     further evaluate CD177 as a test for sGAS, we calculated standard performance parameters
232     (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and percent agreement). For
233     these calculations, we defined a positive result for CD177 as CD177 count per million reads
234     greater than 3 standard deviations above the mean of the nCtrl group. Results are shown in Table
235     S6, along with the same parameters calculated for the clinical tests. Performance parameters for
236     CD177 were: sensitivity 100%, specificity 96%, positive predictive value 91%, negative
237     predictive value 100%, and percent agreement 97%. These parameters were higher than the
238     corresponding parameters for the clinical tests. Because CD177 is a marker of neutrophil
239     activation, we showed expected correlations with WBC and percent neutrophils, displayed in
240     Fig.7, Panel C.
241     Comparison with other studies: To further evaluate CD177 as a potential biomarker to identify
242     bacterial infections, we retrieved gene expression databases from other studies of acute
243     infections, and found evidence of upregulation of CD177 in acute bacterial infection in each
244     study (Fig. S4) (20, 21, 25, 26).
245     Enrichment of GO Biological Process terms: We used Enrichr (27) to analyze biological
246     processes enriched among the upregulated DEG from the comparison of sGAS versus nCtrl. Fig.
247     S5 shows the 20 most enriched GO Biological Process terms. The most significantly enriched
                                                                           11

248     terms related to various aspects of neutrophil activation. Two other neutrophil process terms
249     were enriched to the similar level, but are not shown because Fig. S5 shows only non-redundant
250     terms. Most of the other enriched terms were related to cytokine signaling especially IL-1 beta,
251     and components of the inflammatory response. No terms were significantly enriched among
252     down-regulated genes.

254     Discussion
255     Accurate laboratory diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis, a common infectious disease of
256     childhood, has been elusive. A vexing problem has been inability of microbiology-based tests to
257     distinguish the asymptomatic carrier state from symptomatic infection, resulting in unnecessary
258     use of antibiotics given to carriers with intercurrent viral infection. Because of the frequency of
259     pharyngitis as a reason for outpatient medical visits and the fact that approximately 12% of
260     young children may be carriers (16), the magnitude of overuse from treating carriers is
261     substantial (18). In this study, we show that host response as measured by the transcriptional
262     profile of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) readily distinguishes symptomatic infection from
263     carriage. Furthermore, the transcriptional profile also clearly distinguishes between streptococcal
264     pharyngitis and pharyngitis caused by AdV, an important cause of viral pharyngitis, with clinical
265     findings that may overlap those of streptococcal pharyngitis (28). This work is a first step in
266     developing a new generation of diagnostic tests for GAS pharyngitis that will improve targeting
267     of antibiotic therapy by incorporating host response into the clinical assessment.
268     In carrying out this study, we took advantage of the fact that the microbial agents causing
269     pharyngitis can be accurately detected in readily available samples from the throat. This is in
270     contrast to infection in other parts of the respiratory tract such as pneumonia or sinusitis in which
                                                                           12

271     an invasive procedure such as bronchoscopy or endoscopy is required to obtain diagnostic
272     samples. Using throat swab samples, we performed culture and molecular tests on cases and
273     controls to determine the presence of GAS and respiratory viruses. We also used IgM serology to
274     look for evidence of current or recent EBV infection. This intensive microbiological profiling
275     allowed us to identify well-defined subgroups of subjects with symptomatic GAS infection,
276     symptomatic AdV infection, asymptomatic GAS carriers, and asymptomatic controls.
277     Measurements of traditional host biomarkers including white blood cell count, percent
278     neutrophils, CRP, and PCT corroborated the clinical distinctions between symptomatic cases and
279     asymptomatic controls. Clear delineation of subject classes is a key requirement of studies to
280     define biomarkers intended to serve as classifiers. Thus, even though the number of subjects in
281     our clinical subgroups was not large, the fact that the subgroups were clearly defined by
282     microbiologic tests for the site of disease facilitated the identification of differences in gene
283     expression profiles. Furthermore, the differences in profiles among the subgroups were dramatic
284     and allowed identification of transcripts that can serve as biomarkers. Further confidence in the
285     results is provided by the use of 2-level leave-one-out cross validation, which is part of the PAM
286     procedure used to select and validate classifiers. Thus, even though we did not have a sufficient
287     number of subjects to establish a separate validation cohort, we think our results support the
288     concept that host gene expression can be used for the accurate and clinically relevant etiologic
289     diagnosis of pharyngitis.
290     A consequence of our intensive microbiological characterization of subjects was that we defined
291     a number of dual and/or asymptomatic infections, including subjects who were GAS carriers,
292     others who were asymptomatic but had a respiratory virus detected, and other symptomatic
293     subjects whose illness was characteristic of GAS pharyngitis but also had a respiratory virus
                                                                           13

294     detected. Thorough analyses of gene expression profiles revealed only minimum impact of these
295     dual or asymptomatic infections on the detection of DEG and on the clustering of cases and
296     controls (Fig. S1). These results indicate that a second pathogen that is asymptomatic may not
297     have an important confounding effect on gene expression profiles. A further implication is that
298     as more experience accrues with gene expression profiles in specific infections, it may be
299     possible to use those profiles to understand the relative roles of two or more pathogens that may
300     be detected in the same sample, a common finding when sensitive molecular diagnostic tests are
301     used.
302     In this study, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) as a broad, unbiased approach to prove the
303     hypothesis that differences in host response were present among children with symptomatic
304     GAS, asymptomatic GAS, viral infection as exemplified by AdV, and pathogen-negative
305     controls. We then used shrunken centroid methodology (24), a machine learning technique, to
306     identify panels consisting of limited numbers of transcripts that could distinguish among the
307     clinical subgroups under analysis. We identified a panel of 13 transcripts that distinguished the
308     subjects with symptomatic GAS from all other subjects. The next step in translating these basic
309     results to a diagnostic test will be to incorporate these or similar transcript panels into test
310     formats suitable for use at or near the point-of-care. We are optimistic that this can be
311     accomplished, based on the success of recent rapid multiplex molecular tests that simultaneously
312     identify the RNA viruses influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus within 30 minutes,
313     and are sufficiently simple to perform that they have been granted waived status under the
314     Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988 (CLIA) (29).
315     In our efforts to find small numbers of transcripts that could provide diagnostically useful
316     information, the gene encoding CD177 emerged as a uniquely discriminatory marker. Also
                                                                           14

317     known as human neutrophil antigen 2 (HNA-2), CD177 is a cell surface glycoprotein that is
318     involved in neutrophil activation and neutrophil transmigration (30). Antibodies to HNA-2 are
319     involved in transfusion-associated lung injury (TRALI) (31). The gene is overexpressed in
320     polycythemia vera, and mutations of the gene are associated with myeloproliferative diseases
321     (32). CD177 has also been shown to be upregulated in severe bacterial infections (33),
322     pneumococcal meningitis (34), tuberculosis (35), septic shock (36), and Kawasaki disease (37,
323     38). These results are consistent with our finding of increased CD177 expression in children with
324     symptomatic GAS infection. Although CD177 is not uniquely responsive to GAS infection,
325     species specificity may not be required in a pharyngitis test because its functions would be a) to
326     distinguish between a symptomatic GAS infection versus asymptomatic carriage, and b) to
327     provide an alert that a bacterial infection may be present and antibiotic therapy should be
328     considered. The latter function is important because bacteria other than GAS may cause
329     symptomatic pharyngitis and may benefit from antimicrobial therapy (39).
330     The main goal of this study was development of enhanced diagnostic tools, but the availability of
331     transcriptomes from children with acute GAS pharyngitis plus comparison groups also allowed
332     us to analyze patterns of gene regulation that could provide insights into pathogenesis. To
333     achieve this goal we analyzed the enrichment of upregulated genes for Gene Ontology (GO)
334     Biologic Process terms using the enrichment analysis tool Enrichr. Consistent with the detection
335     of intense upregulation of the neutrophil marker CD177, the 3 most enriched biologic processes
336     were related to neutrophil degranulation and other aspects of neutrophil activity. The other most
337     enriched pathways were related to cytokine signaling and other pathways related to
338     inflammation. Interestingly, there was also activation of pathways not typically associated with
339     gram-positive bacteria including responses to lipopolysaccharide and interferons.

340     Although not a primary aim of this study, the firm classification of cases that was achieved using
341     a battery of conventional and advanced microbiological tests provided an opportunity to evaluate
342     several widely used clinical biomarkers. Of those, PCT had the best performance, with
343     sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 100% respectively, corresponding to percent agreement
344     of 91%. The 13-member transcript panel that we identified had similar performance. Notably,
345     expression level of CD177 alone exhibited the best performance of all. Assays to measure
346     antigens and assays to measure gene expression are alternative approaches that may be used to
347     characterized host response, each of which has specific advantages and disadvantages. A
348     potential advantage of measuring gene expression is that it may be possible to combine detection
349     of pathogen nucleic acid and host response transcripts in a single sample. (40).
350     The major limitation of this study was the relatively small number of subjects. However, because
351     of the clear delineation of clinical subgroups and the dramatic differences in transcriptional
352     profiles between subjects with symptomatic GAS and AdV, GAS colonization, and
353     asymptomatic pathogen-negative controls, we were able to discover impressive differences. The
354     small number of cases prevented us from having a separate validation cohort, so additional
355     studies are needed to confirm our findings, which must be considered preliminary. Another
356     limitation was that our case population was unintentionally unbalanced, with over-representation
357     of African-American females. We do not know if this affected our results, but future studies with
358     a more diverse subject population will be important.
359     In summary, we have shown that transcriptional analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes can
360     provide valuable information that can be used to improve the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis and
361     allow more appropriate targeting of antibiotic therapy than is possible using currently available
362     diagnostic tests. A key step will be to use transcripts identified in this study in simple and rapid
                                                                           16

363     test formats that can be used at or near the point of care. In addition, it will be important to
364     evaluate the possibility of measuring the transcriptional response in pharyngeal samples, which
365     could allow microbial detection and transcriptional analysis to be performed on the same sample.
366     Indeed, we recently reported that the nasal transcriptome was more informative than the
367     peripheral blood leukocyte transcriptome for diagnosing acute viral respiratory infection (23).
368     Another future direction will be to use the transcriptional data to identify new candidates for
369     antigen detection assays. We hope for rapid progress in moving this and related work along the
370     translational pathway to provide diagnostic tools that will promote appropriate use of antibiotic
371     therapy for pharyngitis, an important component in the societal battle to curb unnecessary
372     antibiotic use and prevent the further development of antibiotic resistance (41).

374     Materials and Methods
375     Subjects: Case subjects were children evaluated for acute pharyngitis in the St. Louis Children’s
376     Hospital Emergency Department between January 2017 and February, 2018. Other enrollment
377     criteria were age 3-18 years and a modified Centor score of 4 or 5. The components of the
378     modified Centor score are temperature > 38°; tonsillar swelling or exudate; swollen, tender
379     anterior cervical adenopathy; lack of a cough; and age < 15 years. (42, 43) One point is counted
380     for each component. Children were excluded if they had an underlying medical condition, had
381     received an antibiotic in the 7 days preceding enrollment, or were receiving immunosuppressive
382     therapy. Children whose parents or guardian did not speak English were also not enrolled.
383     Control subjects were children 3-18 years of age being evaluated in the SLCH Emergency
384     Department for a non-infectious condition, with the same exclusion criteria applied as for the
385     case subjects. The study was approved by the Washington University Human Research
                                                                           17

386     Protection Office and informed consent/assent were obtained from all subjects and their families
387     or guardian before participation.
388     Samples: All subjects had a throat swab obtained for detection of group A Streptococcus (GAS)
389     using standard methods. These swabs were collected by Emergency Department staff as part of
390     routine care for case subjects and by study personnel for control subjects. The throat samples for
391     standard GAS detection were processed according to the routine procedures of the Barnes-Jewish
392     Microbiology Laboratory, which included a rapid strep antigen test followed by a culture if the
393     rapid strep test was negative. After the first 21 subjects were enrolled, this procedure was
394     modified so that a culture was performed on all subjects regardless of the results of the rapid test.
395     Each subject also had the following research samples obtained: two throat swabs, a throat wash,
396     a sample of oral secretions, a blood sample drawn into a Tempus blood RNA tube (Thermo
397     Fisher, Waltham, MA) for RNA preservation, a complete blood count, and serum for CRP, PCT,
398     and IgM antibodies for EBV. The assays for CRP and EBV IgM were performed in the Barnes-
399     Jewish Hospital clinical laboratories according to their standard procedures. PCT testing was
400     performed at Mayo Clinic Laboratories. The throat swabs were collected using ESwabs (Copan
401     Diagnostics, Murietta, CA). One throat swab was placed in Universal Transport Media (Copan),
402     stored at -80°C and tested for respiratory viruses using the GenMark eSensor respiratory virus
403     panel (Genmark, Carlsbad, CA). The eSensor testing was performed using a research protocol
404     that detected the following viruses: influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B,
405     parainfluenza virus types 1-4, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, AdV groups B/E and C,
406     coronaviruses OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1. The throat wash was collected by asking subjects
407     to gargle with a volume of 6 ml of normal saline, which was spit into a sterile container. The oral
408     secretion sample was collected by asking the subject to spit 2.0 ml of oral secretions into an
                                                                           18

409     Oragene-RNA tube. RNA was extracted from blood samples using the Tempus Spin RNA
410     Isolation Kit and processed for globin reduction using GLOBINclear Human Kit. All throat, oral
411     secretion, and throat wash samples were tested for GAS nucleic acid using the Alethia Group A
412     Streptococcus molecular assay (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH).
413     RNAseq: RNAseq was performed using cDNA libraries generated from 200 ng of globin-reduced
414     total RNA from each sample as described previously (44). cDNA was quantified using the Qubit
415     Flourometer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and quality assessed by the Agilent
416     Bioanalyzer 2100 (Santa Clara, CA). Libraries were constructed with the NexteraXT library kit
417     (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and quantified with the Qubit Flourometer (Life Technologies, Grand
418     Island, NY). After quality assessment by the Agilent Tape Station (Santa Clara, CA), libraries
419     were sequenced (single end reads) on the Illumina HiSeq2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to
420     generate 20 million reads/sample.
421     Pre-processing of the sequencing reads: RNA-seq reads were aligned to the Ensembl release 76
422     primary assembly with STAR program (version 2.5.1a) (45). Gene counts were derived from the
423     number of uniquely aligned unambiguous reads by Subread:featureCount (version 1.4.6-p5) (46).
424     Sequencing performance was assessed for the total number of aligned reads, total number of
425     uniquely aligned reads, and features detected. The ribosomal fraction, known junction
426     saturation, and read distribution over known gene models were quantified with RSeQC (version
427     2.6.2) (47).
428     Differential expression analysis: All gene counts were then imported into the R package EdgeR
429     (48) and trimmed mean of M values (TMM) normalization size factors were calculated to adjust
430     samples for differences in library size. Ribosomal genes and genes not expressed at a level
431     greater than or equal to 1 count per million reads in the smallest group size were excluded from
                                                                           19

432     further analysis, resulting in 15185 genes for analysis. The TMM size factors and the matrix of
433     counts were then imported into the R package limma (49). Weighted likelihoods based on the
434     observed mean-variance relationship of every gene and sample were then calculated for all
435     samples with the voomWithQualityWeights (50). The performance of all genes was assessed
436     with plots of the residual standard deviation of every gene to their average log-count with a
437     robustly fitted trend line of the residuals. Differential expression analysis was then performed to
438     analyze for differences between sample groups. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were
439     defined as those with at least 2-fold difference between two individual groups at P <0.05. To
440     ensure quality RNA-seq data being used in the study, more stringent analyses were also
441     performed with the DEG that were filtered with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate (FDR)
442     adjusted P <0.05.
443     Classification of sample groups: In order to define a minimal number of genes as classifiers that
444     distinguish individual subgroups (classes), we utilized Prediction Analysis of Microarrays
445     (PAM) (24), which uses nearest shrunken centroids to identify subsets of genes that best
446     characterize each class based on gene expression data (24). In addition, PAM cross-validates the
447     classifiers with a 2-level nested leave-one-out cross validation procedure (L1O-CV), with
448     options for the number of folds of data division and number of model cut-offs to run. We defined
449     classifiers using the default of 30 cutoffs and 10-fold L1O-CV. The receiver operating
450     characteristic (ROC) curves and AUC values were generated with R package pROC.
451     Biological pathway enrichment: A web-based pathway enrichment tool “Enrichr” (27) was
452     utilized to analyze Gene Ontology Biological Processes (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/).
453     Enrichr determines the significance of genes in the gene-list compared to the background of
                                                                           20

454     random gene-lists. The resulting list of mapped terms was ranked by the Benjamini-Hochberg
455     (BH) FDR-adjusted p-value.
456     Statistical analysis: For the comparison of clinical tests, we used one-way analysis of variance
457     for initial determination of differences in means between clinical subgroups. We performed post
458     hoc analysis of differences in means between pairs of subgroups using Tukey-Kramer
459     adjustment. Differences in variance between subgroups were accounted for by estimating
460     separate variance components for each subgroup. P values < 0.05 were considered significant.
461     Analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 24 (IBM Corp.,
462     Armonk, N.Y. USA) and SAS 9.4 (Cary N.C. USA).

773     More importantly, the difference in the magnitude of fold-change values from the two data sets
774     was minimal: 5 out of 1494 (0.3%) differential genes in the sGAS vs. nCtrl comparison had a
775     1.5-fold or greater difference. In the asGAS vs. nCtrl comparison, 7 out of 70 (10%) differential
776     genes had a 1.5-fold or greater difference. Of note, the comparison between asGAS subgroup
777     and nCtrl yielded only a minimal number of differentially expressed genes (DEG).

788     clustering analyses with the 3 outliers included in the analysis and in the heat map. Two clusters
789     were defined, with cluster 1 comprising all 16 symptomatic cases and 2 asymptomatic controls,
790     and cluster 2 comprising the remaining 19 asymptomatic controls. Two of the 3 outliers (P021,
791     P024) clustered with the symptomatic cases and 1 (P003) clustered with the asymptomatic
792     controls. (B) Same analysis as in (A) but excluding the 3 outliers from the analysis and from the
