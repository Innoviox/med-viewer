   Abstract

   Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic is considered one of the most serious public

   health crisis over the last few decades. Although the disease can result in diverse, multiorgan

   pathology, there have been very few studies addressing the postmortem pathological findings

   of the cases. Active autopsy amid this pandemic could be an essential tool for diagnosis,

   surveillance, and research.

   Objective: To provide a total picture of the SARS-CoV-2 histopathological features of

   different body organs through a systematic search of the published literature.

   Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google

   scholar, Medrxiv & Biorxiv) was carried out from December 2019 to August, 15th 2020, for

   journal articles of different study designs reporting postmortem pathological findings in

   COVID-19 cases. PRISMA guidelines were used for reporting the review.

   Results: A total of 50 articles reporting 430 cases were included in our analysis. Postmortem

   pathological findings were reported for different body organs, pulmonary system (42 articles),

   cardiovascular system ( 23 articles), hepatobiliary system (22 articles), kidney (16 articles),

   spleen, and lymph nodes (12 articles), and central nervous system (7 articles). In lung samples,

   diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was the most commonly reported findings in 239 cases

   (84.4%). Myocardial hypertrophy (87 cases by 51.2%), arteriosclerosis (121 cases by 62%),

   and steatosis ( 118 cases by 59.3%) were the most commonly reported pathological findings in

   the heart, kidney, and hepatobiliary system respectively.

   Conclusion: Autopsy examination as an investigation tool could help in a better understanding

   of SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and subsequently improving

   patient care.

   Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, Histopathology, Autopsy, forensic pathology, COVID-19

             The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is considered one of the most

   challenging public health crisis in the past century. It first emerged in Wuhan, China, in late

   December 2019 and believed to be caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory

   syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐ CoV‐ 2) virus. (1) The first cases of COVID-19 in China were

   believed to be of zoonotic origin, but the global spread of the disease was mainly travel-related.
                                                                                                                        (2)
   The disease has spread from China to affect nearly 200 countries all over the world.                                       The

   virus is easily transmissible via droplets and fomites or when bodily fluids of the infected

   individual come in contact with another person’s face, mouth, eyes, or nose. (3)

             Regarding pathogenesis, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is highly

   expressed on the respiratory tract, acts as a receptor to SARS-CoV-2. The virus invades the

   human cells causing massive destruction and inflammation of different organs and
                                                                                                                (4)
   subsequently affecting the vascular supply and even progression to fibrosis.                                       The main

   clinical manifestations include fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Other less

   common symptoms include headache, sore throat, and rhinorrhea. Along with that, one-fifth of

   patients (20%) presented with severe symptoms such as respiratory failure, multiorgan failure,

   septic shock, all of which necessitate intensive care. (5) Although COVID-19 is mainly affecting

   the respiratory system, there have been reported cases of cardiogenic and renal involvement in

   patients without previously known heart or renal diseases. (6, 7)

             The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 is variable across different nations, between

   11.75% in Italy and 0.37% in South Africa. The mean recovery time is two weeks for mild

   cases and 3-6 weeks for severe or critical cases. (8) The diagnosis of COVID-19 relies mainly

   on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with some emerging evidence
                                                                  (9)
   on characteristic CT and laboratory findings.                        COVID-19 is a member of the coronavirus
                                                                        (10)
   family, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.                                    Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are

   believed to affect humans and cause interstitial pneumonia, pneumocyte hyperplasia, and acute

   diffuse alveolar damage. (11, 12) The diverse histopathological findings associated with COVID-

   19 infections suggest that multiple organs are affected by the virus, with the pulmonary system

   is the most common system to be affected. Carsana et al. showed in their study the variety of

   the pathological findings of COVID-19 in the respiratory system. They’ve found that the

   pneumocytes desquamation, pulmonary edema, and diffuse alveolar damage are the most

   common microscopic findings. (13)

             As of August 10th, 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide surpassed

   20,162,474 million cases, with almost 737,417 deaths. However, the number of studies

   addressing the postmortem autopsy findings of COVID-19 patients is still scarce compared to

   the number of deaths. This could be explained by the fears of contagiousness associated with

   COVID-19 infection.

   Since the beginning of the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

   released interim guidelines for the collection and analysis of clinical specimens that might

   contain SARS-CoV-2. (14)

             Active autopsy amid emerging epidemic diseases has been identified as an essential

   tool for diagnosis, surveillance, and research. Pathologists are usually among the first health
                                                                                                    (15)
   care professionals in identifying novel infectious agents outbreaks.                                    Our aim in this

   systematic review is to provide a total picture of the SARS-CoV-2 histopathological features

   of different body organs in postmortem autopsies through a systematic search of the published

   literature. We believe this will help in a better understanding of mechanisms of injury and

   pathophysiology of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequently improving patient care.

   This study followed the recommendations established by the Preferred Reporting Items for

   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. (Appendix-1) (16)

   2.1. Sources of information

   A predetermined protocol was used to perform this systematic review using the following

   databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and MedRxiv. The search included

   articles published between December 2019 and August 15th, 2020. The reference lists of

   relevant studies were hand-searched to identify cited articles that were not captured by

   electronic search.

   2.2. Selection criteria

   Articles were included if they met the following eligibility criteria: (1) addressed pathological

   reports of COVID-19 autopsies or postmortem cases, (2) involved human subjects (at least one

   case), (3) all study designs were involved (case report, case series, cross-sectional, case-control,

   randomized and non-randomized studies), (4) no language restrictions were applied.

   2.3. Study selection and search terms

   The search terms and keywords across the different databases have been provided in

   (Appendix-2). The selection was broad to include as many studies as possible. In the initial

   phase, two independent reviewers (H.H. & A.B.) screened the titles and abstracts of the articles

   using the Rayyan QCRI® website. As a result, all non-relevant articles were excluded. In the

   second phase, the full-texts of the remaining articles were independently reviewed for the final

   selection of eligible studies. Any disagreement between the two reviewers was resolved by a

   third reviewer (T.B.).

   2.4. Quality assessment and risk of bias
   To assess the internal validity of the included studies, we used different tools according to study

   design. For cross-sectional studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS)

   (modified for cross-sectional studies) was used after removing items that relate to

                                                               perpetuity.

   comparability and adjustment. The tool contains three major subsections (Selection,

   Comparability, and Outcome). A score for quality, modified from the tool, was used to assess

   the appropriateness of study design, recruitment strategy, sample representativeness, reliability

   of the outcome, sample size provided, and appropriate statistical analyses. At least two

   reviewers (H.H., A.B., T.B.) independently ranked these domains. When the independent

   evaluations of the ranks differed between the two reviewers, they discussed disagreements to

   reach for mutual decision. For case reports and case series, a version of (NOS) checklist was

   adapted by Murad et al. to assess the methodological quality of case reports and case series. (17)

   By this approach, we assessed the quality of each study with regard to four domains: selection,

   ascertainment; causality; and reporting. From the results of each checklist, if 25% or less of the

   criteria were addressed, the article was scored as poor; if 26% to 50% of the criteria were

   addressed, the article was scored as fair; if 51% to 75% of criteria were addressed, the article

   was scored as good; and if 76% to 100% of the criteria were addressed, the article was scored

   as excellent.


 2.5. Data extraction

   A single author (A.B.) extracted the variables from each included study. The data from the final

   list of included articles onto an online Google sheet. Several study characteristics were

   extracted, including;

            General characteristics as study type, country of origin, article language sample size.

            Study population demographics like age and gender.

            Clinical findings like symptomatology, lab findings, and patient comorbidities.

            Histopathologic and microscopic findings of different organs.

   Figure 1 is a flow chart showing the procedure for the selection of studies. Initially, we

   identified 3297 from 5 databases as follows; PubMed (2,262), ScienceDirect (189), MedRxiv

   & BioRxiv (71), and Google Scholar (775). After the initial title screening, there were 689

   articles by 08/15/2020. 211 duplicates were removed, leaving 478 for abstract screening. After

   excluding non-relevant articles, the final number of included articles is (50).

   3.1 | Characteristics of included studies


   A total number of 50 studies were included in our systematic review, with overall 430 cases.

   Regarding the date of publication, only three studies were published in February, two in March,

   seven in April, and started to increase to reach 15 in May, which is the month with the highest

   number of publications. (Figure 2) Regarding the type of published articles, case reports and

   case series were the most common type by 39 studies, then cross-sectional studies with 10

   publications, and 1 cohort study. Regarding the country of origin of the published studies, there

   were about 16 countries. The USA was the country with the most publications (16 studies),

   followed by China (10 studies), Germany (6 studies), Italy (5 studies), Switzerland (2 studies),

   and one study for each of the following countries (Iran, Finland, Austria, Belgium, Japan,

   Spain, Netherland, UK, Romania, Austria, & Denmark). Regarding the Language of the

   published articles, there were only two languages English & Chinese. English with 47 studies

   and Chinese with 3 studies. (Table 1)


   3.2 | Quality of evidence


   We used the GRADE framework for judging the precision and confidence estimate in the

   review. Generally speaking, the evidence derived from observational studies is classified as of

   low quality. (18) Regarding the risk of bias assessment in the review, 4 articles scored between

   26 -50 %, which is considered “Fair”                  (19-22)
                                                                   26 articles scored between 51-75 %, which is

   considered as “Good” (13, 23-47), and 20 articles scored more than 76 % which is considered as

   “Excellent.”        (48-67)
                                   A high degree of inconsistency was noticed in the review as the study

   populations were somehow heterogeneous in the main characteristics like age, gender, and

   comorbidities. Although there were no language restrictions applied in the review, publication

   bias may appear due to the fact that the number of the published literature was small, especially

   at the beginning of the pandemic. Moreover, a very small number of countries were reporting

   autopsy findings. Regarding the indirectness, the majority of included studies used the same

   tool in diagnosing COVID-19, which is (RT-PCR), the same tool in identifying

   histopathological findings, and the studied population varied between studies. Hence, the

   quality of evidence was rated as “Moderate.” (Appendix-4)


   3.3 | Clinical findings of the cases


   The review described a total of 430 patients with COVID-19. Among the included patients,

   gender was reported in 349 patients as follows; 297 males (85.1%) and 133 (14.9 %) female.

   Among the no patients for whom age was reported, the median age was (range: 11 to 94 years).

   Regarding the presenting symptoms of patients whom clinical symptoms were reported (192

   patients), fever was reported in 121 patients followed cough in 103 patients and dyspnea (91

   patients). (19-26, 28-32, 34, 36, 38-42, 44-48, 51-53, 55-57, 59, 60, 62-66) Regarding the pre-existing co-morbidities

   in patients whom medical history was reported, hypertension was found in 210 patients

   (48.8%), followed by coronary heart disease in 190 (44%), Diabetes in 134 patient (31%),

   chronic kidney disease in 96 patients (22.3%), obesity in 64 patients (14.8%), chronic lung

   disease in 54 patients (12.5%) and cancer in 50 patients (11.6%). (13, 19, 20, 22-32, 34, 38-41, 44-65, 67)

   Regarding the included organs, this review described the histopathology of different organs as

   follows; Lung and pulmonary system was the most common described organ in 42 articles, (13,
   19-26, 28-32, 34-37, 39-41, 44-46, 48-60, 62-66)
                                                      followed by heart in 23 articles (19, 20, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29, 31, 32, 40, 41,
   44-46, 48-52, 54, 63, 65, 66)

   article), (42) Pharynx (1 article). (50)


   3.4 | Laboratory investigations:


   In all included studies, RT-PCR of Nasopharyngeal swab was the main method to confirm the

   positivity of COVID-19 in all patients. RT-PCR for COVID-19 of the Endotracheal Aspirate

   4. Discussion

   This systematic review identified 50 studies with a total of 430 patients and postmortem

   pathological findings of different body organs. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the

   body of evidence and the number of published studies have increased over time, but it is still

   limited compared to the number of COVID‐ 19 deaths almost (1 million deaths). There were

   only 16 countries that contributed in publishing autopsy reports of the COVID-19 deaths,

   which is considered very low considering the fact that the disease affected nearly 200

   countries all over the world. (2) With regard to the timeline of the published studies, it took us

   five months (up to May 2020) so that we can find an appropriate number of publications

   addressing the postmortem pathological findings. One of the main reasons for the limited

   published literature is the fear of COVID-19 infection transmission during the postmortem

   examination and the perceived risk of healthcare professionals, especially pathologists, about

   this ‘new’ disease with a poor understanding of its pathological mechanism, especially at the

   beginning of the pandemic. (68) Moreover, in some countries, the number of safe autopsy

   rooms is very low, which, according to the WHO & CDC guidelines, is considered one of the

   barriers that contributed to the scarce evidence. (69-71)


   Postmortem pulmonary findings:


   Regarding the postmortem pulmonary pathology, our review showed that different

   histopathological findings had been identified among COVID-19 cases. Diffuse alveolar

   injury, hyaline membrane formation, pneumocyte hyperplasia, microthrombi, fibrin

   exudation, pulmonary fibrosis, and intra-alveolar hemorrhage are among the most frequently

   reported pathological findings. Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) has been reported the most

   among all pulmonary findings with 239 cases (84 %). On second thoughts, these pathological

   findings should not be seen as one of the COVID-19 attributes without considering other

   important factors affecting the course of illness like age, symptoms, comorbidities, and

   management plan. For example, Wichmann et al. investigated the possibility of attributed

   venous thromboembolism in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Autopsy findings found that

   deep venous thrombosis was found in 58 % of the cases, and this has been linked to COVID-

   19 while ignoring the fact that the majority of patients suffered from atrial fibrillation,

   coronary heart disease, and cancers, which have been proven to be decisive determinant

   factors in developing thromboembolism. (30)


              On the other hand, similar pathological and autopsy findings have been reported in

   deceased patients with other coronavirus infections such as Middle East respiratory syndrome

   coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). NG et al.

   published a case report of a 45 years old patient with MERS-CoV with autopsy findings after

   death. Postmortem pulmonary findings included diffuse alveolar damage, type 2 pneumocyte

   hyperplasia, interstitial infiltrate, alveolar fibrin deposits, and prominent hyaline membranes.
   (72)
          Alsaad et al. also reported DAD in his report that included 33 years old patient with

   MERS-CoV. (11) Moreover, Franks et al. reported in their study of 8 SARS patients that DAD

   was the main pathological findings. In contrast, Nicholas et al. reported other findings like

   the focal deposition of fibrin along the exposed basement membrane. (12, 73) On the other hand

   and in non-coronaviruses pulmonary infection like H1N1 cases, histopathological findings as

   septal inflammation, congestion, and thickening of alveolar septae, patchy peripheral

   hemorrhage, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage have been reported by different studies. (74-77)

   Other Organ findings

   Regarding the postmortem cardiac pathology, there were 23 studies with a total number of 87

   cases addressing the histopathological findings in the heart. Myocardial hypertrophy, small

   coronary vessels, cardiac fibrosis, cardiac cell infiltrate, and cardiac amyloidosis are the main

   findings. Although viral myocarditis has been reported in patients with SARS-Cov-2 virus,

   lymphocyte infiltrate was found only in one case reported by Buja et al. during

   Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. (28, 78) These pathological findings could be attributed to

   the comorbidities of affected patients, as most of them suffered from hypertension, diabetes, or

   coronary heart disease. On the other hand, myocardial edema and fibrosis have been recorded

   in deceased patients with SARS and MERS-CoV. (72, 79, 80) As the studies in this review reported

   that nephrosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, glomerulosclerosis, and acute tubular injury were the

   most commonly reported findings in the postmortem renal biopsies, other pathological findings

   like hyaline arteriolosclerosis, patchy interstitial inflammation, and granular casts have been
                                                                                                (72, 81, 82)
   reported in other coronavirus cases like SARS & MERS-CoV.                                                   Regarding the

   pathological findings in the hepatobiliary system, our review found that hepatic fibrosis,

   steatosis, cirrhosis, and interstitial inflammations were the main findings. In contrast, other

   pathological findings were reported in patients with SARS-CoV-1 infection like lymphocytic
                                                     (83)
   infiltrate and balloon degeneration.                     As for histopathological findings of the spleen and

   lymph nodes, lymphocyte depletion and hemophagocytosis of the Spleen and lymph nodes

   were the main findings. Our results were consistent with similar pathological findings from

   other coronavirus infections. (79, 84)

   Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus hasn’t been detected in the spinal fluid, our study suggests

   that COVID-19 had been capable of infecting the central nervous system via olfactory and

   trigeminal nerves causing cerebral hemorrhage, focal spongiosis, and vascular congestion. (85)

   On the contrary, and in the case of SARS infection, RT-PCR has detected the genomic

   sequences of the virus in cerebral spinal fluid and brain tissue specimens and was responsible

   for brain edema and neuronal degeneration. (81, 86)

   Limitations of the study

   As a part of any research, we faced many limitations while conduction the review. First, in this

   study, we focused on the available studies in certain databases in the first months of the

   pandemic, so government reports and other relevant grey literature weren’t included in this

   review, so publication bias is a possibility. Second, due to the scarcity of the evidence, we

   decided to include pre‐ prints. These publications have not yet undergone peer review.

   However, since we assessed the risk of bias of these studies, we feel that the benefits of

   including the data from these pre‐ prints in our review outweigh the risks. Third, we’ve

   included only 50 articles, but we can’t ignore the fact that the number of publications is

   increasing daily, and we might have missed the recently published ones. Fourth, missing

   information in some of the published articles has been a challenge. Many articles didn’t report

   the basic characteristics of the cases like gender, comorbidities, and clinical course of the

   disease.

   5. Conclusion

   Postmortem histopathological biopsies play an essential role in understanding the

   pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 affects different body organs with

   different pathological features throughout the course of infection. Cellular destruction, vascular

   invasion, and fibrous formation have been identified in the pulmonary, hepatobiliary, and renal

   systems, while they are not clear in other systems like CNS and genitourinary system. Further

   research is needed for a better understanding of the disease and exploring the extent of its

   effects on different organs and tissues.
