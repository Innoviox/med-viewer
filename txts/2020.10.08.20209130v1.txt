          ABSTRACT
          Background
          The Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) is a highly-phenotyped longitudinal study of
          cognitive and brain ageing. Given its substantial clinical importance, we derived an indicator
          of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as amnestic and non-amnestic subtypes at three
          time points.
          Methods
          MCI status was derived at three waves of the LBC1936 at ages 76 (n=567), 79 (n=441), and
          82 years (n=341). A general MCI category was derived as well as amnestic MCI (aMCI) and
          non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). A comparison was made between MCI derivations using
          normative data from the LBC1936 cohort versus the general UK population.
          Results
          MCI rates showed a proportional increase at each wave between 76 and 82 years from 15%
          to 18%. Rates of MCI subtypes also showed a proportional increase over time: aMCI 4% to
          6%; naMCI 12% to 16%. Higher rates of MCI were found when using the LBC1936 normative
          data to derive MCI classification rather than UK-wide norms.
          Conclusions
          We found that MCI and aMCI rates in the LBC1936 were consistent with previous research.
          However, naMCI rates were higher than expected. Future LBC1936 research should assess
          the predictive factors associated with MCI prevalence to validate previous findings and
          identify novel risk factors.

          Background
          In conjunction with advancements in health and social care in the past century, life
          expectancy has improved dramatically and contributed to a rapidly increasing older
          population.1 A consequence of this demographic shift is the challenge we now face to care
          for a larger number of older adults with susceptibility to cognitive deterioration.2
          Understanding how cognitive decline affects older people is imperative in order to design
          interventions to slow or delay decline and ensure individuals are on the healthiest ageing
          trajectory possible.3 Decline in memory is a key indicator of dementia, however it is
          common in older age, and differences between normal age-related decline and the early
          stages of dementia can be difficult to differentiate.4
                    The concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) traces back many years but has
          gained particular traction over the past few decades.5 Petersen, Doody, Kurz, et al.                                    6
          popularised the concept as a distinct clinical condition and established a set of criteria based
          on memory changes without loss of ability to undertake normal activities. These criteria
          heavily influenced the way in which MCI was, and continues to be, identified in research and
          clinical settings. However, other researchers such as Dubois & Albert 7 disputed the notion
          of MCI as a distinct clinical entity, instead proposing it as a stage of severity for particular
          disorders. Accordingly, they proposed a ‘prodromal Alzheimer’s Disease’ based upon
          subjective memory complaints with progressive onset, preserved ability to undertake
          activities of daily living, neuroimaging, and biomarker testing. Disagreement on how MCI
          should be conceptualised has led to multiple attempts at an international consensus.
                                                             8
          Winblad, Palmer, Kivipelto, et al.                    reached consensus that MCI criteria should assess
          whether an individual has a dementia diagnosis, whether their cognition has shown
          subjective and/or objective decline over time, and whether their activities of daily living are
          significantly affected – and, indeed, how this latter criterion is judged. This groundwork
          informed the most recent guidelines proposed by the National Institute on Aging-
          Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) workgroups on diagnostic guidelines for Alzheimer's
          disease.9 These guidelines propose four criteria based on: 1. Concern regarding a change in
          cognition, 2. Impairment in one or more cognitive domains, 3. Preservation of
          independence in functional abilities, 4. No diagnosis of dementia. In addition to identifying
          general MCI, there has also been increased interest in identifying specific subtypes of MCI
                                                                        3

          that may precede certain types of dementia. For instance, amnestic MCI (aMCI) focuses
          solely on memory-related cognitive impairment, whereas non-amnestic MCI (naMCI)
          focusses on cognitive impairment in other domains such as processing speed, attention, and
          executive functions.10 Whilst aMCI is associated with a high risk of converting to Alzheimer’s
          disease, naMCI is associated with other types of dementia such as diffuse Lewy body
          dementia.11 Identifying MCI in general as well as its subtypes will allow for improved
          knowledge on how early prevention strategies can identify individuals who are at high risk
          of cognitive decline and subsequent dementia. Here we use the NIA-AA guidelines to derive
          an identification of MCI and its subtypes using data from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936.12,13
          We hypothesise that MCI rates will be similar to those found in other older adult cohorts
          and that prevalence of all types of MCI will be higher in later data waves.
          Methods
          At Wave 1, the LBC1936 study consisted of 1091 participants, born in 1936 with a mean age
          of 69 (SD=0.89) years, mostly surviving members of the Scottish Mental Survey 1947.14
          Wave 1 took place between 2004 and 2007, with follow-up waves approximately every
          three years thereafter at ages: 73 (n=866), 76 (n=697), 79 (n=550), and 82 years (n=431).
          More details on recruitment and testing procedures have been published previously.12,13,15
          The LBC1936 study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines.
          Ethical permission for the LBC1936 study protocol was obtained from the Multi-Centre
          Research Ethics Committee for Scotland (Wave 1: MREC/01/0/56), the Lothian Research
          Ethics Committee (Wave 1: LREC/2003/2/29), and the Scotland A Research Ethics
          Committee (Waves 2, 3, 4 & 5: 07/MRE00/58). Written consent was obtained from
          participants at each of the waves.
          Identification of MCI
          Using data previously collected in the LBC1936, an algorithm was created which identifies
          participants who fulfil the MCI criteria as outlined by the NIA-AA workgroups on diagnostic
          guidelines for Alzheimer's disease.9 Variables necessary to conduct MCI coding were
                                                                        4

          collected from Wave 3 (age 76) onwards. In order to be classified in the MCI category,
          participants must have shown met all four criteria reported below:
              1. Concern regarding a change in cognition: Self-reported memory problems that are
                    interfering with their life, as recorded in a questionnaire at each wave.
              2. Impairment in one or more cognitive domains: Scores at least 1.5 SD below the
                    mean on at least one cognitive domain (memory, executive function, attention,
                    language, or visuospatial skills) AND either shows a decline from the previous wave
                    to below the 10th percentile on one test, a decline from wave 1 to below the 20th
                    percentile on one test, or a decline from the previous wave to below the 20th
                    percentile on two tests.
              3. Preservation of independence in functional abilities: Scores at least 1.5 SD below
                    the mean on the Townsend’s Disability Scale overall score.16
              4. No diagnosis of dementia: Does not self-report or have a formal diagnosis of
                    dementia AND scores at least 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).17
                    Cognitive domains were assessed using the following cognitive tests: Symbol Search,
          Digit Symbol Coding, Matrix Reasoning, Letter-Number Sequencing, and Block Design from
          the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS) and Logical Memory I & II from the Wechsler
          Memory Scale III (WMS-III).18 A cut-off of ≥1.5 SD below the mean or scoring below specific
          percentiles was used to indicate cognitive impairment. Two versions of the cognitive
          impairment criterion were conducted using the means and standard deviations of individual
          tests from (1) the LBC1936 sample at each wave and (2) a more representative UK sample
          provided by the WAIS-III-WMS-III technical manual.18 Preliminary comparisons showed that
          fewer participants were identified as having MCI using the general population norms, likely
          due to the higher rates of overall healthiness in the LBC1936.13 Therefore, the definition
          using UK normative data were used here as they were more reflective of the general
          population.
                    We also coded two subtypes of MCI: Amnestic MCI (aMCI) and Non-amnestic MCI
          (naMCI). Creation of these subtypes followed the same procedure as for the general MCI,
          however aMCI was only identified if the participant showed impairment in the memory
          domain. Similarly, classification for naMCI was met if the participant showed impairment in
                                                                        5

          cognitive domains other than memory (executive function, attention, language, or
          visuospatial skills).
          Covariates
          We examined the association between a range of covariates and MCI status. Covariates
          included: age, sex, years of education, age 11 cognitive function, body mass index (BMI;
          calculated          in     the      standard         way       of     kg/m2),      occupational       social       class
          (professional/managerial/skilled, non-manual/skilled manual or semiskilled/unskilled), APOE
          ε4 status (allele present/absent), self-reported history of cardiovascular disease, self-
          reported history of stroke, depression, and physical frailty level (not frail/pre-frail/frail).
          Physical frailty was derived using the Fried Phenotype guidelines19, for information on how
          this was calculated in LBC1936 see Welstead, Muniz-Terrera, Russ, et al. 20. Depression was
          measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS).21 Age 11 cognitive
          function was based on LBC1936 participant’s scores on the Moray House Test (MHT) at age
          1122; for more detail see Taylor, Pattie, Deary 13. To adjust for age in days at time of testing,
          MHT11 scores were residualised for age at 11 years.
          Statistical Analysis
          Three participants had been diagnosed with dementia before age 76 (wave 3) by the
          LBC1936 study doctor and were excluded, leaving 694 participants at that wave.
          Additionally, since a wide variety of variables were required in order to derive an MCI
          coding, missing data at each wave meant that some participants were excluded from
          analyses (wave 3; n=127, wave 4; n=106, wave 5; n=87). Accordingly, MCI status was coded
          for 567 participants at wave 3 (age 76), 441 at wave 4 (age 79), and 341 at wave 5 (age 82).
          Descriptive analyses including number and percentages of people with MCI were used to
          characterise the study sample. Linear Model ANOVAs and Pearson’s Chi-squared tests were
          used to assess characteristics associated with MCI and Non-MCI participants. All statistical
          analyses were conducted in R Version 3.6.1.23
                                                                        6

          Results
          Figure 1     show the rates of MCI in the LBC1936. There was an increase in people with MCI
          over time with 15% at wave 3 (                 n=87/567),    17% at wave 4 (      n=77/441), and    18% at wave 5
          ( n=62/341) having          MCI. As there were a substantial number of participants who withdrew
          from    the    study     between      baseline     and   final  follow-up,    we   also   looked at   MCI   rates     for
          completers only, i.e. those who completed waves 3, 4, and 5. Results showed an overall
          proportional increase over follow-up with 14% of completers identified as having MCI at
          wave 3 (n=38/271) and wave 4 (n=38/271), and then a rise to 21% at wave 5 (n=57/271).
           Figure 1: Comparisons of MCI rates in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study across
          waves using UK wide normative data
                    MCI rates did not differ significantly by sex at any of the waves. The only significant
          differences found indicated that higher rates of MCI were associated with                        APOE ε4 status at
          wave 3 (    p<0.001) and wave 5 (p<0.05), and history of stroke at wave 3 (p<0.01) and wave 5
          ( p<0.05). Covariate differences according to MCI status are reported in Table 1.

          MCI subtypes
          We also derived two subtypes of MCI: aMCI and naMCI. As reported in                         Figure 2   , proportions
          of aMCI remained fairly low across follow-up from 4% at wave 3 (n=24/604), to 4% at wave
          4 (n=21/484), and 6% at wave 5 (n=24/376). Prevalence of naMCI was higher and showed a
          gradual proportional increase over follow-up from 12% at wave 3 (n=73/609), to 14% at
          wave 4 (n=63/466), and 16% at wave 5 (n=56/361).

          We compared whether MCI rates were sensitive to the use of different normative data.
          Comparisons were made between MCI rates when using normative data based on the
          LBC1936 and a UK-wide sample to derive the identification of MCI. As might be expected
          with a healthy cohort, at all waves there were higher proportions of MCI when using the
          LBC1936 norms compared to the UK based norms. Supplementary figure 1 reports MCI
          rates at each wave according to the LBC1936 normative data.
          Discussion
          We found MCI proportions in the LBC1936 study of 15%, 17%, and 18% at ages 76, 79, 82
          years, respectively. Similar proportions were found when looking only at the individuals who
          attended all waves. MCI status at wave 3 and wave 5 (but not wave 4) was significantly
          associated with APOE ε4 status and history of stroke. Proportions of people with aMCI were
          4% at ages 76 and 79 years and 6% at 82 years, whereas rates of naMCI were higher but still
          showed an increase in proportions from 12% at age 76 years to 14% and 16% at 79 and 82
          years, respectively.
          Comparison with other literature
          We observed higher rates of MCI in men, albeit not at a statistically significant level, a
          finding that is consistent with some previous research , but not all. As discussed by
                                                                                     24,25               26,27
          Xue, Li, Liang, Chen , sex differences in MCI research are inconsistent and may differ
                                         27
          according to alternate methods of deriving MCI. Importantly, the assessment of day-to-day
          function in men and women presents different challenges, and perhaps surprisingly, there
          were minimal significant associations between groups of individuals defined by key features.
          At two of the time points APOE ε4 status was associated with having MCI, a finding which
          has been consistently found in previous MCI research and is also strongly linked to the risk
          of progression to dementia. The only other characteristic associated with MCI change was
                                                  28
          having a history of stroke, again somewhat unsurprising given the extensive evidence that
          stroke patients have higher risk for developing of MCI and dementia. The lack of significant29
          association between these factors and MCI status at wave 4 is unexpected and not readily
                                                                        11

          explained. However, it may be related to attrition or other factors leading to sample
          differences at wave 4; the proportion of participants with MCI who had an APOE ε4 allele
          present or a history of stroke was lower at wave 4 than waves 3 or 5.
                    As expected, findings also showed an increase in proportion of participants with MCI
          at wave 5 compared to wave 3. The rates of MCI we find are consistent with previous
          research using the same MCI coding guidelines which reports an average prevalence of
          14.8% for 70-75 year olds. The rates of two subtypes of MCI – aMCI and naMCI – were in
                                                30
          partial agreement with previous literature. Some previous research has found rates of       10
          around 3-4% of both aMCI and naMCI in older populations, whilst others have found 11%
          for aMCI and 5% prevalence for naMCI. Thus, whilst the aMCI results are expected, the
                                                                   26
          rates of naMCI in the LBC1936 are higher than anticipated. Higher rates of naMCI than aMCI
          may indicate that participants of the LBC1936 are more prone to non-amnestic cognitive
          impairment in areas such as language, visual-spatial skills, attention, or executive
          functioning. Another possibility is that the salient memory problems associated with aMCI
          may make participants more likely to withdraw from the study, whereas the cognitive
          problems associated with naMCI (executive function, attention, language, or visuospatial
          skills) may more often go unnoticed by the participant. However, it is also important to note
          that making comparisons between our proportions of aMCI and naMCI cannot be done
          entirely accurately given that cases of missing data differed between them.
          Limitations and Strengths
          LBC1936’s rates of high physical health and cognitive ability is well documented , and                      13,15
          highlights a limitation of this study: our sample is less representative of the general
          population who likely have higher rates of MCI. An additional limitation that affects the
          accuracy of our results was that there was a relatively small number of participants who
          were identified as having aMCI, which introduces an element of uncertainty into our results.
          For the participants who withdrew from the study, we did not have systematic information
          on their reason for dropping out. It is likely that at least some of these participants dropped
          out due to MCI or dementia, and accordingly we were unable to consider these cases in our
                                                                        12

          analyses. Related to this, other than three cases in which we had confirmation from the
          LBC1936 study doctor, we relied primarily on the self-reporting of dementia diagnoses for
          part of the MCI criteria. This could have introduced bias if additional participants had a
          dementia diagnosis but did not report it. Whilst self-reporting is used extensively in
          epidemiological studies and biases are usually insignificant , given the nature of dementia,
                                                                                          31
          using these measures may have introduced inaccuracies. Current work is being undertaken
          in the LBC1936 to ascertain dementia status for every participant and so future research will
          be able to revisit this.
                    The strengths of this study are our use of data collected at multiple time points over
          the course of approximately six years in a well-characterised longitudinal cohort study.
          Using more than one time point gives us better insight into how MCI proportions change
          over time in the LBC1936. An additional strength is that we derived and compared an MCI
          coding using normative cognitive data from the LBC1936 sample and the UK wide norms. By
          doing so, we were able to assess the extent to which the LBC1936 data are representative of
          the wider population. As anticipated, MCI rates were higher at all waves when using the
          LBC1936 norms, presumably due to an overestimation caused by the higher rates of
          healthiness found in the LBC1936 when compared to the general population. Deriving MCI
          using the cohort’s own normative data will cause the cognitive impairment cut-off points to
          be more lenient than using normative data from the UK population as we see in our results.
          Implications
          Our findings have added to the current literature by providing information on the
          prevalence of MCI in a prominent longitudinal cohort study, reinforcing findings found in
          similar cohorts. The identification of individuals with MCI in the LBC1936 and their
          comparison with findings in similar cohorts provides opportunities for future research to
          further explore MCI in this cohort. In particular, utilising the wealth of longitudinal data in
          the LBC1936 could prove insightful. MCI has been shown to be relatively fluid over time with
          both declines and reversions being common . Accordingly, understanding this fluidity
                                                                         32-34
          and the predictive factors associated with MCI change will be insightful for future
                                                                        13

          interventions and prevention strategies that aim to lower the risk of MCI developing and
          progressing.
          Conclusion
          This study is largely consistent with previous research, finding MCI rates of 15% to 18% in
          the LBC1936 at ages 76 to 82. When considering subtypes of MCI, non-amnestic MCI is more
          likely to affect participants than amnestic MCI indicating that perhaps this population is
          more prone to cognitive decline in non-amnestic cognitive domains. These results help
          highlight the prevalence of MCI in the LBC1936 and allow for future studies to explore
          cognitive trajectories over time and the predictive factors which may increase the risk of
          developing MCI.
