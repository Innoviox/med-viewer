         Abstract:
         The whole world is battling against coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by
         severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Various strategies are taken
         to curb the spread of the virus and to move out from the enforced lockdown stage.
         Serological tests are the neediest diagnostic and surveillance tool to complement the gold
         standard molecular diagnostic method to track down the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2.
         Automated chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) based analyzers become highly
         demanding platforms both to clinicians and policy makers for the detection anti-SARS-CoV-2
         antibodies. In this study, serum from 594 patients positive for COVID-19 and 100 samples
         from pre-COVID cases were tested by three automated platforms: Abbott architect i2000SR,
         Roche cobas e411 and Yhlo iFlash 1800 and their diagnostic accuracy were compared. All
         three platforms showed high specificity as claimed by manufacturer. Clinical sensitivities of
         the machines were calculated as 64.48% (58.67-70.3) for Abbott, 80.48% (76.62-84.34) for
         Roche and 76.94% (72.65-81.23) for Yhlo. The Cohen’s kappa value was determined from
         0.69-0.89 when inter-rater agreements were calculated. The area under the curves (AUC)
         values demonstrated Roche Cobas e411 as the diagnostically most accurate platform among
         the three CLIA analyzers.

         Introduction:
         The world is still dealing with the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe
         acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) since it started in December 2019 (1,2).
         Accurate and speedy diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is very much needed for prompt and
         effective patient care. Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) followed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase
         chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard of molecular diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 detection (3).
         However, sometimes it fails to demonstrate the complete picture of the rapid transmission of the
         virus through communities (4). Hence, serological test is believed to be another important
         diagnostic tool along with swab test. This test is also called as antibody test as it detects anti-SARS-
         CoV-2 immunoglobulins which are usually formed in patient body as early as by 1 week and in
         general within 2-3 weeks from the infection onset (5,6). Antibody tests are a useful surveillance
         tool to track down the prevalence of COVID-19 epidemiology and to assess the current immune
         status of a certain community. Serological tests are also useful for the policy makers to decide the
         lockdown entry and exit strategies, particularly in this second wave of pandemic (7-9).
         Currently, there are several serological assays are available in the market to detect anti-SARS-CoV-
         2. These are mainly relied on the principle of quantitative laboratory-based enzyme linked
         immunosorbent assay (ELISA), chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), or a qualitative point-of-
         care test (POCT). Recently developed fully automated analysers based on CLIA technology are
         having high potential with large throughput (10,11). However, to detect the accurate one is of
         great challenge. In this study, we compared three such automated analysers: ARCHITECT i2000SR
         (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, USA), Cobas e411 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)
         and iFlash 1800 (Shenzhen Yhlo Biotech Co. Ltd., Shenzhen, China) to identify their diagnostic
         accuracy.
         Methods:
         Collection of serum sample
         Serum samples were collected from recovered COVID-19 patients after 4 weeks and not more
         than 8 weeks from the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All the COVID-19 patients were
         confirmed positive to SARS-CoV-2 tested by oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs followed by
         RT-PCR. COVID-19 patients were informed about the serological test with proper written consent.

         A total of 594 subjects were chosen for this study between 23th July 2020 and 14th September
         2020. The 100 samples collected during pre COVID period (August, 2019) and stored in RMRC-
         Bhubaneswar sample repository were used as control. The study was approved by Institutional
         Ethics Committee.
         Test method
         All three different automated machines can qualitatively detect anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibodies based
         on the two-step immunoassay principle. Abbott made ARCHITECT i2000SR platform uses
         chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology for the detection of
         immunoglobulin class G (IgG) antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 from
         human serum. The specificity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay in this platform was 99.63% (95%
         confidence of interval [CI]: 99.05-99.90%) and sensitivity was 100% (95% CI: 95.89-100%) when
         tested after 14 days post-symptom onset as per the manufacturer. The cut-off value was 1.4
         index. Second automated machine Cobas e411 by Roche Diagnostics determined the presence of
         antibodies including IgG against SARS-Cov-2 based on a patented electro chemiluminescence (ECL)
         technology. The test principle was a sandwich assay using biotinylated SARSCoV2specific
         recombinant nucleocapsid protein and streptavidin-coated microparticles. The specificity of
         Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 was reported as 99.81 % (95% CI: 99.65-99.91%) and the sensitivity was
         100 % (95% CI: 88.1-100%) as per manufacturer when the serum was tested after 14 days post
         SARS-Cov-2 confirmation. The cut-off value of this assay was 1.0 COI. The third one, Yhlo Biotech
         manufactured iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was a paramagnetic particle based chemiluminescent
         immunoassay (CLIA) to determine the IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike
         protein. According to the manufacturer, the clinical specificity and sensitivity of this assay were
         96.3% and 97.3%, respectively. Result was interpreted either as non-reactive: < 10.0 AU/mL or
         reactive: > 10.0 AU/mL.
         Statistical analysis
         Descriptive statistical analyses were performed by SPSS software (IBM SPSS statistics for Windows,
         version 24.0, Armonk, NY). The agreement among the automated platforms were measured by
         Cohen’s kappa (ĸ). Specificity, sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive
         value (PPV) were calculated for each individual assay. Area under the curves (AUC) were compared
         from the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves of the three different platforms. p value
         <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

         Results
         A total 594 samples from recovered COVID-19 patients and 100 pre-COVID serum samples were
         analysed in the 3 CLIA platforms. Table 1 describes the calculated specificity and sensitivity of all
         three automated SARS-CoV-2 antibody detecting platforms. Abbott showed a specificity of 99%
         (95% CI: 97.09-100.92%) and with sensitivity of 64.48% (95% CI: 58.67-70.3). The PPV and NPV
         were determined as 99.74% (99.25-100.24) and 31.94% (16.1-47.78), respectively. Specificity for
         iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay was 100%, whereas sensitivity was calculated as 76.94% (72.65-
         81.23). This platform had a PPV of 100% and NPV of 42.2 (27.67-56.72). Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-
         CoV-2 insert recorded highest sensitivity 80.48% (76.62-84.34) compared to other two
         chemiluminescent platforms and the specificity (100%) was same with Yhlo machine. The PPV and
         NPV of Roche analyser were 100% (100.0-100.0) and 46.3% (32.3-60.3), respectively.
         The ROC performance curves showed that Roche platform had the highest AUC value of 0.929
         (95% CI: 0.910 – 0.948). Architect i2000SR gave AUC value of 0.863 (95% CI: 0.836 - 0.889) and for
         iFlash 1800, it was calculated as 0.897 (95% CI: 0.875 – 0.920).
         Inter-rater agreement between Roche and Abbott was measured by ĸ value of 0.694 (95% CI:
         0.641 - 0.746) which is a good agreement (Table 2). The percent agreement between these two
         platforms was 85.3%. The ĸ value was determined as 0.758 (95% CI: 0.709 - 0.807) between Yhlo
         vs Abbott analyzers and 88.3% was the percent agreement. A very good agreement (ĸ =0.892; 95%
         CI: 0.856 - 0.927) was found between Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 vs iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The
         percent agreement of 95.2% demonstrated the best inter-rater reliability among the raters (table
         2).
         Discussion
         With the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the communities, rapid and bulk tests are
         urgently needed to determine the extent of COVID-19 pandemic at community level. Serological
         testing is a complementary test of conventional swab tests to predict the epidemiology
         prevalence. Serological surveys are useful tool to predict how far a community is from herd
         immunity (5,12). Routine antibodies tests are also necessary to identify the potential convalescent
         plasma donor for plasma therapy of critically ill COVID-19 patients (13). It is highly challenging to

         choose the best diagnostic platform for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies test from the market available
         machines. To our best knowledge, the concordance of these three popular automated
         chemiluminescent assay platforms are evaluated for the first time in this study.
         Currently, there is no gold standard for serological detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and
         comparative studies. Hence, we include a total of 100 pre-COVID samples as control set to
         determine the diagnostic accuracy. The chances to get anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies became higher
         after 14 days from the first detection. To test the diagnostic sensitivity, we included only those
         COVID-19 positive patients who had been confirmed at least 28 days before and recovered from
         the day of serum sample collection. Among the 594 positive sera samples, 378 samples gave
         positive or reactive whereas, 109 samples (18.35%) showed non-reactivity or negative in all three
         platforms. A 18.35% of non-reactive results revealed a majority of COVID-19 recovered patients
         were unable to produce detectable titre of antibodies. This result suggested us that the exact
         immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is still poorly understood by the researchers.
         Both Roche and Yhlo platform were found to have 100% specificity, which is more than the
         manufacturer claimed value. In term of sensitivity, Roche insert showed highest sensitivity
         (80.48%) against anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies including IgG compared to both Abbott (64.48%) and
         Yhlo (76.94%). A study by Perkmann et al. showed a higher sensitivity for Abbott (84.6%) and
         Roche (89.2%) platforms although that might be because of the low number of recruited COVID-19
         patients (n=65) (14). Similarly, another study with iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgG measured a sensitivity of
         76.7% with 61 positive sera which is same (76.9%) with our result and thus corroborated our study
         with higher sample size (15).
         The AUC values represented the diagnostic accuracy of among the three platforms and Roche gave
         the highest value of 0.929 at 95% CI. Inter-rater agreement those platforms were statistically good
         and found to be the highest between Roche and Yhlo. As per our study, Roche Cobas e411
         automated chemiluminescent platform gave the best diagnostic accuracy. Statistically determined
         ĸ value demonstrated other two machines were also not too behind from Roche as both of them
         showed good percent agreement. Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay is based on the nucleocapsid
         determination of SAR-CoV-2 and iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay insert detected both nucleocapsid
         and spike proteins. However, both the assay platform showed an agreement of 95.2% which
         suggested that diagnostic accuracy was not truly depended on the target antigen as per this
         comparative study.

         Since everyone around the world is looking forward to see the herd immunity in their respective
         localities and therefore the rapid serological testing is the high need of current time (16). The
         opportunity to test outside the laboratory is high to cover the larger population without putting
         the extra burden on the clinical laboratories and POCT may play an important role in doing so.
         However, mistakes in interpretation of test results, untrained staffs and low sensitivity &
         specificity could be the biggest roadblocks while performing the POCT as a tool for serological
         testing (17). Therefore, the automated machines are recommended for testing with high
         sensitivity and specificity to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and that is too in very short time.
         In conclusion, detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are highly inconsistent throughout all the
         different automated chemiluminescent assay platforms. This study shows the diagnostics accuracy
         of three popular automated platform and compared their agreements when tested with higher
         sample size. This is the first such demonstration of these three platforms which would be very
         much helpful for further development of epidemiological strategies to contain COVID-19
         pandemic and also in the clinical context.
