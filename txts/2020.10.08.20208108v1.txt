11 ABSTRACT
    In anticipation of COVID-19 vaccine deployment, we use an age-structured mathematical model to investigate the benefits of
    optimizing age-specific dose allocation to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Across 179 countries, we find that the highest
12
    priority individuals are typically those between 30 and 59 years of age because of their high contact rates and higher risk of
    infection and disease. We reaffirm that vaccination alone may be insufficient to achieve herd immunity in some settings, and
    that additional intervention measures may be required. Nevertheless, we show that optimizing the allocation of vaccine doses
    can more than double their effectiveness.
13 Main
14 Assuming a safe and sufficiently effective vaccine is approved for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-
15 CoV-2), the infection that causes coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), it is critical that initial deployments are targeted not only
16 at those at greatest risk of infection and disease, but those most responsible for ongoing transmission. At present, there are no
17 treatments to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic COVID-19 disease; however, there are at least 76 potential
18 vaccine candidates under either clinical (five) or pre-clinical (71) investigation1, 2 .
19      SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible (basic reproduction number, R0 = 2.68; 95% credible interval: 2.47 - 2.86)4 and
20 notoriously difficult to contain. In contrast with SARS-CoV-1, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is partly driven by asymptomatic
21 and presymptomatic individuals5 , with the former accounting for up to 30% of all infections by some estimates6 . Such "silent
22 transmission" severely complicates infection control as it limits both (i) the capacity of non-pharmaceutical interventions such
23 as case isolation and contact tracing to identify carriers and contain the spread of infection; and (ii) the potential impact on
24 transmission of vaccines that prevent symptomatic disease only, since asymptomatic individuals can remain highly infectious.
25 Together, these highlight the need for a vaccine that disrupts transmission and helps reach the herd immunity threshold: where
26 the immune fraction of the population yields an effective reproduction number, Reff < 1.
27      In the absence of pre-existing immunity, the minimum population-level vaccination coverage required to achieve herd
28 immunity (under the assumption of homogeneous mixing and susceptibility across the population) is (1 − 1/R0 )/e; where
29 the vaccine efficacy, e, is included because even the most effective vaccines only confer partial protection — particularly
30 amongst the elderly. Given an R0 of 2.68, SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity thresholds can be estimated at between 60 and 70%,
31 which equates to approximately 90% population-wide vaccination coverage for a vaccine that is 70% effective. However,
32 recent studies incorporating population heterogeneity have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity thresholds may be
33 considerably lower than naïve estimates7–10 . This is due to the fact that young-to-middle-age groups have high contact rates
34 combined with high infectiousness and susceptibility to infection. Removing these persons from the susceptible pool would
35 therefore have disproportionate effects on the transmission potential. These observations are crucial for vaccination strategies,
36 as they imply that the age-specific characteristics of both social mixing and SARS-CoV-2 infection could be leveraged to
37 increase the efficiency of vaccine campaigns.
38      In this study we use an age-stratified SARS-CoV-2 transmission model — which incorporates age-dependent susceptibility
39 and disease severity calibrated to COVID-19 patient data11 — to estimate the age-specific transmission rates among infected
40 individuals in 179 countries. We then use the candidate vaccine profiles developed by the World Health Organization12 to

41 identify the optimal age-specific allocation of vaccine doses to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission by: 1) minimizing the effective
42 reproduction number, Reff , for a fixed number of available vaccine doses (categorized according to the fraction of the population
43 that could receive a full vaccination course, i.e., the population-level coverage); and 2) minimizing the number of doses required
44 to suppress transmission and achieve elimination (Reff < 1).
45      We also consider two separate modes of action for vaccine candidates: those that reduce the recipient’s susceptibility to
46 infection; and those that protect against symptomatic disease in persons who become infected. In each case vaccine doses are
47 allocated independently among individuals divided into 10-year age bands from 0 − 9 up to 70+ years of age.
48      At baseline, we assume that the vaccine is 70% effective12 across all age groups and that both individual susceptibility
49 and risk of symptomatic disease are age dependent (see Methods). Variations to these assumptions are investigated through
50 sensitivity analysis (Supplement).
51      To demonstrate the breadth of optimal solutions that can be obtained across different regions, we provide detailed results
52 for India, China and the United Kingdom (UK), which span low- to high-income settings and exhibit diverse population
53 demographic structures and contact networks — moreover, the latter two (China13 and the UK14 ) have pre-COVID-19 contact
54 survey data available. We also provide the global distribution of minimum vaccination coverage required to achieve herd
55 immunity. Detailed, age-specific breakdowns for the remaining 176 countries appear in the Supplement.
56 Results
57 Age-specific transmission rates
58 The different age distributions (Fig. 1A-C) and contact patterns in different countries drive highly heterogeneous transmission
59 rates (Fig. 1D-F) among age groups and settings. Transmission in low- (e.g., India) and middle-income countries, which
60 typically have bottom-heavy age pyramids, is predominately driven by younger age groups (0-29 years of age), particularly
61 between individuals of the same age and from younger to older ages. However, there is often some additional inter-generational
62 transmission generated by those between 20 and 59 years of age (Fig. 1A,D). Conversely, in China where high numbers of
63 daily contacts were recorded among those aged 60 and above13 , transmission is much more intensely concentrated in the
64 older age groups. In high-income settings (e.g., the UK), we see that in addition to the intense within-age-group transmission
65 among those aged 19 years and below (which is similar to low-income settings), there is considerably more inter-generational
66 transmission generated by those individuals aged between 20 and 69 years, which becomes even more intense for regions with
67 top-heavy age distributions such as Japan and Hong Kong (see Supplement).
68 Minimizing transmission with a fixed number of doses
69 Targeted vaccination dramatically reduces the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate relative to vaccination programs that uniformly
70 distribute doses across the population (Fig. 2). Reductions are greatest at intermediate levels of population-level coverage (e.g.,
71 60%) as results under the two strategies converge when coverage approaches 0 or 100%.
72      Countries with contacts concentrated among a limited number of age groups (e.g., China, Fig. 2B) exhibit greater reductions
73 in transmission under targeted vaccine allocation, as do countries with higher median ages (e.g., the UK, Fig. 2C) because older
74 populations with rectangular age distributions possess greater scope for targeted dose allocation.
75      Vaccines that reduce susceptibility to infection more effectively suppress transmission than those that prevent symptomatic
76 disease among infected individuals (Fig. 2). The latter not only exhibit less improvement under targeted dose allocation, but
77 they also fail to reach the herd immunity threshold in almost all settings considered (the exceptions being countries with
78 baseline R0 values very close to one, e.g., Samoa).
79      Looking at the age-specific dose allocation under optimized vaccination (Fig. 3), we observe that vaccines that protect
80 against symptomatic disease (Fig. 3A-C) prioritize slightly older age groups than those that reduce susceptibility to infection
81 (Fig. 3D-F). In either case, we find that individuals between 30 and 49 years of age (i.e., those typically most responsible for
82 inter-generational transmission) are often assigned the highest priority among all age groups. As more doses become available
83 (e.g., as 60% population-level coverage is reached), the targeted age groups expand contiguously, either to include 10-19 and
84 20-29 year olds or 50-59 year olds, depending on whether vaccination protects against infection or disease, respectively. For
85 each level of vaccination coverage and protection mode, the lowest priority individuals are typically those 70 years of age and
86 over. Notable exceptions include China (Fig. 3B,E) where the high number of contacts among individuals over the age of 60
87 mean the elderly (i.e., 60+ year olds) should be the first group vaccinated.
88      In sensitivity analysis with reduced efficacy among 60+ year old individuals (i.e., 35% v. 70% in those <60 years old), we
89 find similar results to those presented above, with changes in priority assigned to older individuals typically within the range of
90 variation obtained from near-optimal solutions (grey bars) (Fig. S1). However, when we use an alternate model parameterization
91 that only allows age-dependent variation in the clinical fraction (keeping individual susceptibility fixed across all age groups)
92 we observe a shift in priority away from 50+ year old individuals to much younger age groups (particularly 10-19 year olds) in
93 India and the UK; whilst the results in China are qualitatively similar under the different model parameterizations (Figs. S4-S9).

    individual in age group j over the course of an infectious episode with COVID-19. The elements of each matrix have been
    rescaled such that the maximal eigenvalues of the respective transmission matrices match the basic reproduction numbers (R0 )
    estimated by Abbott et al.15 , namely India: 2.2; China: 2.6; and the United Kingdom: 2.3.
 94 Efficiently reaching the herd immunity threshold
 95 Following our analysis of optimal age-specific vaccine allocation under the constraint of finite available doses, we next
 96 investigated the inverse problem: calculating the minimum number of doses required to achieve herd immunity under targeted
 97 vaccine allocation. Given the results of the previous section indicating that vaccines that protect against symptomatic disease
 98 are often unable to achieve herd immunity, in this section we focused specifically on vaccines that reduce susceptibility to
 99 infection, which were shown to be more effective.
100     Under uniform vaccine allocation programs we observe that with a vaccine that is 70% effective at reducing susceptibility
101 to infection most countries require population-level vaccination coverages in excess of 80% (Fig. 4). In particular, we find that
102 whilst vaccination appears to be a viable strategy to achieve herd immunity in some settings, more than 20% of the countries
103 considered would require substantial coverage levels (>85%) to reach this goal, whilst for several others (e.g., France) herd
104 immunity may be unachievable through vaccination alone.
105     In contrast, when dose allocation is optimized by targeting specific age groups, we observe dramatic reductions in the
106 minimum population-level coverage required to achieve herd immunity (Fig. 5) — with most countries requiring less than 65%
107 nationwide coverage under optimized, infection-preventing vaccination programs. As above, we find that countries with more
108 intensely concentrated contacts within particular age groups experience greater (relative) reductions in the minimum population
                                                                                                                                              3/20

109 coverage required to achieve herd immunity under targeted vaccination programs, which in some cases can exceed 50% (e.g.,
110 Mozambique).
111     In both the uniform and targeted vaccination scenarios, the greatest variation in minimum coverage is observed across the
112 African continent, which contains countries that require very low levels of vaccination (e.g., Angola, Mozambique), along with
113 countries for which vaccination alone is insufficient to achieve herd immunity (e.g., Libya, Zimbabwe).
114     Results obtained through sensitivity analysis with reduced vaccine efficacy in the 60+ year age groups (i.e., 35% v. 70% in
115 those less than 60 years of age) are in most cases within a few percent of those presented in Figs. 4 and 5 (see Figs. S2 and S3).
116 One notable exception is China, which under constant vaccine efficacy required only 61% (88%) population-level coverage
117 under a targeted (uniform) vaccination policy, but is unable to reach the herd immunity threshold when efficacy wanes in 60+
118 year old individuals because of the high number of contacts amongst individuals in this age group.
119     We note that the minimum target values presented in Figs. 4 and 5 are highly sensitive to: (i) case-count-derived estimates
120 of the basic reproduction numbers provided by Abbott et al.15 (and are therefore subject to biases introduced by variations in
121 country-specific reporting rates); and (ii) the baseline vaccine efficacy (assumed here to be 70%). Nevertheless, our results can
122 be readily rescaled without the need for re-optimization should updated estimates of R0 or vaccine efficacy become available.
123 Discussion
124 Targeting vaccination towards age groups that contribute more to the transmission of infection can dramatically enhance
125 the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination. Whether the goal is to minimize transmission for a fixed number of doses or
126 to minimize the number of doses required to achieve a certain reduction in transmission, our analysis indicates that dosage
127 requirements or transmission rates can be halved under tailored age-specific vaccination strategies. Whilst the choice of which
128 age groups to initially target for vaccination is dependent on setting, vaccinating middle-aged individuals (30-59 years of
129 age) typically had the highest impact across the 179 countries considered (e.g., India and the UK). However, there were some
130 settings (e.g., China) in which those aged 60 and above were the first to be selected for vaccination (in line with observed
131 contact structures13 ).
132     Additionally, the ability of vaccination to reduce transmission is highly dependent on the type of protection conferred16 .
133 Since asymptomatic individuals contribute substantially to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, vaccines that prevent symptomatic
134 disease but allow transmissible asymptomatic infection failed to achieve herd immunity in the overwhelming majority of
135 settings considered; whereas vaccines that prevent initial infection by reducing the recipient’s susceptibility were far more
136 likely to achieve elimination (and concomitantly possess greater scope for optimization). In either case, we emphasize that a
137 vaccine with less than 100% efficacy may require substantial population-level coverage in order to achieve herd immunity17 ,
138 although this threshold can be considerably reduced through targeted vaccination — as suggested by studies that account for
139 heterogeneities in population susceptibility and mixing10 .
140     In settings for which vaccination alone proves insufficient, supplementary measures may need to be invoked to achieve
141 elimination; this may include a reliance on pre-exisiting immunity generated by initial COVID-19 epidemic waves — which
                                                                                                                                              4/20

    optimal solution (coloured bars) we provide the 2.5−97.5 percentile ranges (vertical grey lines) and median values (grey dots)
    of age-specific coverage levels for all locally optimal solutions whose Reff is within 1% of the global optimal value. Panels
    A-C show the results for vaccines that prevent symptomatic disease. Panels D-F give the analogous results for vaccines that
    prevent infection. Here we have assumed that the vaccine is 70% effective across all age groups (remaining model parameters
    assume their baseline values which can be found in Table S1).
142 several serological surveys reveal may have already reached a sizeable fraction of the optimal targets identified in our analysis18 .
143 We have chosen not to account for pre-existing immunity as a result of past infection in our analysis because of the difficulties
144 in quantifying its contribution relative to that of vaccination.
145      Throughout our analysis we have attempted to account for parameter uncertainty by exploring a range of alternatives
146 suggested by the World Health Organization’s recent vaccination modelling call12 . Nevertheless, several limitations and
147 possible extensions to the existing analysis remain. To begin, no vaccine provides perfect protection — and certainly not across
148 all age groups. The results presented herein assume a vaccine efficacy of 70% that is sustained across all age groups at baseline;
149 however, results assuming reduced efficacy (35%) in individuals over 60 years of age are presented in the Supplementary
150 Materials. We found that reduced efficacy in individuals over 60 years of age had a negligible impact on the predicted minimum
151 vaccination coverage targets and the level of priority assigned to particular age groups for most countries — China being a
152 notable exception. Moreover, since the former estimates scale linearly with baseline efficacy, it is straightforward to update
153 these values for vaccine efficacies other than 70%; nonetheless, the priority assigned to each age group should remain invariant.
154      Next, we chose optimization targets designed to reduce transmission, which we defined through the reduction in the effective
155 reproduction number, Reff . Whilst such targets may be suitable for settings in which transmission is currently suppressed by
156 existing (non-pharmaceutical) control measures (e.g., New Zealand), countries with ongoing epidemics may choose to prioritize
157 more severe outcomes such as COVID-19-related mortality. Although dynamic outputs such as cumulative morbidity (e.g.,
158 Disability-Adjusted-Life-Years; DALYs) and mortality are beyond the scope of the present analysis, we anticipate that such
159 targets will bias optimal vaccine allocation towards older age groups who typically suffer worse disease-related outcomes.
160 This was demonstrated in the recent analyses aiming to minimize deaths through vaccination by Hogan et al.16 and Matrajt et
161 al.19 . These authors found that when doses are limited, older age groups should be the first to receive vaccination. Ultimately
162 however, we expect that the best way to limit deaths is to limit transmission, such that the priority age-groups identified by
163 these alternate optimization targets will not deviate significantly from the results obtained here when population-level coverage
164 is sufficient to limit transmission; this view is supported by16, 19 and the recent analysis by Ragonnet et al.20 which optimized
                                                                                                                                              5/20

165 age-specific mixing to achieve herd immunity whilst minimizing deaths and years of life lost.
166     Furthermore, to avoid excessive speculation, we have not factored in the costs and feasibility of age-specific vaccine roll-out
167 as part of our optimization search. However, alongside the global optimal solutions identified for each age group and setting,
168 we have also indicated a range of possible age-specific coverage levels that have near-equivalent (within 1%) transmission
169 reduction potential that may be selected if proven more cost-effective in practice.
170     In this modelling study, we have exclusively chosen to optimize vaccine allocation by age. This choice is motivated by
171 the most readily available patient and contact data (which regularly provide breakdowns by age) and the subsequent analyses
172 that have firmly established that infection and disease risk vary substantially by age. Subsequent studies could also consider
173 alternative demographic strata with known correlations with infection risk and disease severity, including occupation (e.g.,
174 health- and aged-care workers) and socio-economic status, as well as the presence of comorbodities.
175     Another important limitation of our analysis is the reliance on case-based estimates for the basic reproduction number, R0 , in
176 each country. To be conservative, we have taken the upper limit of the 90% credible interval provided by the analysis in Abbott
177 et al.15 . Whilst variations in reporting rates within different host countries will likely bias these estimates, our predictions for
178 the minimum vaccination coverage for each country can be re-scaled to account for any updated values. Regardless, we point
179 out that it is only the total reduction in Reff (in the fixed doses case) or minimum target coverage (in the unlimited doses case)
180 that is sensitive to R0 , while the optimal age-specific allocation of available doses should remain unaltered.
181     We also note that the limited efficacy of disease-preventing vaccines stems from the prominence of sub-clinical transmitters,
182 which, following Davies et al.11 , we have assumed are 50% as infectious as clinical cases. If the contribution of asymptomatic
183 transmission (either in the natural infection case or post-vaccination) is found to be lower, the estimated effectiveness of
184 vaccines that prevent symptomatic disease would correspondingly increase.
185     Another important consideration is the impact of waning vaccine-induced immunity, and the potentially harmful conse-
186 quences of delaying an individual’s age-at-first-infection. This issue is known to influence the course of vaccination for several
187 other communicable diseases (e.g., varicella21 and rubella) and may have important ramifications for COVID-19 that should
188 be explored as more data become available — particularly given the significantly poorer outcomes observed among older
                                                                                                                                              6/20

189 individuals.
190      Finally, if and when a COVID-19 vaccine is approved and made available globally, it is critical that doses are allocated in
191 a manner that most efficiently curtails transmission — as initial supplies will undoubtedly be limited. Our study shows that
192 setting- and age-specific optimization of vaccine allocation can provide substantial improvements in efficiency over uniform
193 vaccination programs, saving up to half of the available doses to achieve the same reduction in transmission in some settings.
194 Moreover, in deriving the minimum coverage thresholds required to achieve herd immunity in 179 countries, this analysis has
195 also underscored the often overlooked and unsavory outcome that vaccination alone may not be enough to completely suppress
196 COVID-19 (particularly if the vaccine fails to prevent initial infection). In this case, permanent control measures — which may
197 include social distancing or improved hygiene — may be required alongside vaccination.
198 Methods
199 Calibrating transmission and the next-generation matrix
200 To model the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 we stratify the population into 16 5-year age bands i ∈ {0−4, 5−9, 10−14, . . . , 70−
201 74, 75+} and assume that individuals in age group i possess a relative susceptibility to infection ui . Once infected, an age-
202 dependent fraction yi go on to develop symptomatic (i.e., clinical) disease whilst the remaining (1 − yi ) develop asymptomatic
203 (i.e., sub-clinical) disease. We assume that individuals in the sub-clinical class are less infectious than those in the clinical class
204 by a relative factor f (set at 0.511 ) and that the total time spent infectious for both classes is τ = 5.0 days11 .
         Each day, each individual in age group j makes ci j contacts with individuals in age group i leading to the following
    expression for the (unscaled) next-generation matrix (NGM)11, 22 :
                    ui Si ci j
            K̄i j =            [y j + (1 − y j ) f ]τ                                                                                            (1)
                       Nj
205 where Si is the number of susceptible individuals in age group i and N j is total number of individuals in age group j.

        The (i, j)th entry of the NGM K̄ is proportional to the average number of new infections in age group i generated by an
    individual in age group j over their entire infectious lifetime. To calculate the actual number of infections generated by each
    individual these entries must be scaled by the (pseudo-)probability of transmission given contact, which we denote by η. In
    particular, the basic reproduction number, R0 , which is proportional to the maximal eigenvalue of K̄, can be expressed as
                                                    R0
            R0 = ηρ(K̄)            ⇒      η=                                                                                                    (2)
                                                 ρ(K̄)
206 where we use ρ(K̄) to denote the spectral radius of the matrix K̄.
207     For each of the 179 countries considered in our analysis we used estimates of R0 based on observed case counts15 to
208 calibrate country-specific values for the scaling factor η. In particular, we assume R0 in each country is equal to the maximum
209 value of the 90% credible interval upper limit of the time-varying reproduction number estimates generated by Abbott et al.15 .
210 Where these values are unrealistically high (e.g., North Macedonia returned an R0 greater than 30) we used estimates provided
211 by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
212     We assume that the age-dependent susceptibility (ui ) and clinical fraction (yi ) are universal across all countries and allow
213 only the age-specific contact rates (ci j ), initial population sizes (Si and N j ) and transmission scaling factor η to vary among
214 settings, i.e., all other parameters remain fixed among countries (see Table S1).
215     We consider three separate models for age-dependent susceptibility and clinical fraction: M1 — allowing both age-dependent
216 susceptibility and clinical fraction; M2 — allowing age-dependent susceptibility only; and M3 — allowing age-dependent
217 clinical fraction only. The results for model M1 are those presented in the main article, whilst results for models M2 and M3
218 appear in the Supplement. Parameter values under each model have been calibrated to patient data in Davies et al.11 and can be
219 found in Table S2.
220     Where available, the daily, age-dependent contact rates, ci j , between individuals in each country were taken from previously
221 conducted nationwide contact surveys. This was the case for China13 and the UK14 , as well Italy, Germany, Luxembourg, the
222 Netherlands, Poland, Finland and Belgium23 and Zimbabwe24 . In the absence of such survey data, synthetic contact matrices
223 extrapolated from existing contact surveys across multiple settings were used25, 26 .
224 Modelling vaccination
225 To incorporate vaccination of otherwise susceptible individuals, we let vi denote the fraction of individuals in age group i that
226 are vaccinated (i.e., the coverage of age-group i), e denote the baseline efficacy of the vaccine, and ri its age-dependent relative
227 efficacy. For tractability, here we divide the population into 10-year age bands such that the vector vi has eight free parameters
228 that are repeated pairwise to cover the 16 5-year age bands defined above.
        We investigate two distinct modes of action for potential vaccines, those that protect against initial infection and those that
    protect against symptomatic disease following infection. The former equates to a removal of susceptible individuals from the
    total population whilst the latter influences the fraction of individuals that go on to develop symptomatic disease. The unscaled
    NGM in each instance transforms, respectively, to:
                           ui (1 − eri vi )Si ci j
            K̄ivac,inf
                j      =                           [y j + (1 − y j ) f ] τ.                                                                     (3)
                                      Nj
    and
                           ui Si ci j
            K̄ivac,dis
                j      =              [(1 − er j v j )y j + (1 − (1 − er j v j )y j ) f ] τ.                                                    (4)
                              Nj
    In the presence of vaccination, the effective reproduction number, Reff , can be calculated via
            Rkeff = ηρ(K̄ vac,k )                                                                                                               (5)
229 where the index k ∈ {inf, dis} denotes the type of protection conferred by vaccination, and the scaling factor η is calibrated
230 according the procedure described in the previous section.
231 Optimizing vaccination
232 Using expression (5) for the effective reproduction number as a function of the age-specific vaccination proportions v =
233 (v0−9 , v10−19 , . . . , v70+ ), we pursue two optimization targets: 1) minimizing the effective reproduction number (Reff ) for a given
234 (fixed) number of doses; and 2) minimizing the total number of doses (i.e., population-level coverage) required to achieve herd
235 immunity, which we define as obtaining an effective reproduction number less than one. These optimization problems can
236 respectively be stated as
                                                                                                                                              8/20

           Minimize Reff (v) subject to             ∑ vi Ni = constant.                                                                         (6)

        2. Efficiently reaching the herd immunity threshold.
           Minimize       ∑ vi Ni     subject to Reff (v) < 1.                                                                                  (7)

237     Since the surface Reff (v) = const. is highly complex, we expect that there may be multiple solutions to the optimization
238 problems 1. and 2. Therefore, we used a stochastic simulated annealing algorithm to search the parameter space and re-ran it
239 multiple times to uncover multiple solutions of roughly equivalent quality (i.e., similar objective values). Hence, in addition to
240 storing the global optimum value (i.e., the solution with the minimum objective value among all solutions obtained) we also
241 retained the values obtained from each of the remaining runs whose objective value was within 1% of the global optimum (the
242 range of these values is indicated by the grey bars in Fig. 3).

Figure S1. Optimal age-specific vaccination policy (with reduced efficacy in 60+ year olds). The optimum coverage
level for each age group (coloured bars) for varying levels of population-level coverage for India (left), China (middle) and the
United Kingdom (right). Alongside the global optimal solution (coloured bars) we provide the 2.5−97.5 percentile ranges
(vertical grey lines) and median values (grey dots) of age-specific coverage levels for all locally optimal solutions whose Reff is
within 1% of the global optimal value. Panels A-C show the results for vaccines that prevent symptomatic disease and Panels
D-F give the analogous results for vaccines that prevent infection. Here we have assumed that the vaccine is 70% effective for
individuals aged 60 years and less and is 35% effective in those over the age of 60 (remaining model parameters assume their
baseline values, which can be found in Tables S1 and S2).
