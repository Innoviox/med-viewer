          Abstract
          Background: Deviating growth from the norm during childhood has been associated with
          anorexia nervosa (AN) and obesity later in life. In this study, we examined whether polygenic
          scores (PGS) for AN and obesity are associated, individually or combined, with a range of
          anthropometric trajectories spanning the first two decades of life. Methods: AN-PGS and
          obesity-PGS were calculated for participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and
          Children (ALSPAC; N= 8,654 participants with genotype data and at least one outcome
          measure). Using generalized (mixed) linear models, we associated PGS with trajectories of
          weight, height, body mass index (BMI), fat mass index (FMI), lean mass index (LMI), and
          bone mineral density (BMD). Growth trajectories were derived using spline modeling or
          mixed effects modeling. Results: Between age 5-24 years, Females with one SD higher AN-
          PGS had on average a 0.01% lower BMI trajectory, and between age 10-24 years a 0.01%
          lower FMI trajectory and 0.05% lower weight trajectory. Higher obesity-PGS was associated
          with higher BMI, FMI, LMI, BMD, weight, and lower height trajectories in both sexes. The
          average growth trajectories of females with high AN-PGS/low obesity-PGS remained
          consistently lower than those with low AN-PGS/low obesity-PGS; this difference did not
          reach statistical significance. However, post-hoc comparisons suggest that females with high
          AN-PGS/low obesity-PGS did follow lower growth trajectories compared to those with high
          PGS for both traits. Conclusion: AN-PGS and obesity-PGS have detectable sex-dependent
          effects on a range of anthropometry trajectories. These findings encourage further research in
          understanding how the AN-PGS and the obesity-PGS co-influence growth during childhood
          in which the obesity-PGS can mitigate the effects of the AN-PGS.

          Introduction
               Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious psychiatric disorder that is characterized by low fat
          and lean mass [1–3]. Observations from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) point
          toward the contribution of genomic variants that influence body composition as well as
          psychiatric traits [4]. Genetically, AN is negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI),
          fat mass, fat-free mass, and obesity [4], suggesting that biological mechanisms contributing
          to AN may also drive changes in body composition. This is supported by several studies
          showing that low premorbid BMI is associated with AN in adolescence [5,6] including an
          Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) study that reported individuals
          who go on to develop AN followed lower BMI trajectories (as early as age 2 years) compared
          to their peers that did not develop an ED [7].
               In contrast to low weight, obesity (i.e., BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) has been associated with
          increased risk for cardiovascular disease but also for psychiatric disorders [8,9]. In addition,
          individuals with higher body weight face stigmatization and prejudice from the public and
          health professionals, which can exacerbate the negative health effects of obesity [10–12].
          Similar to AN, BMI has been extensively studied on a genetic level and has been shown to be
          a heritable polygenic trait [13,14]. Khera et al. [15] reported that an obesity polygenic score
          (obesity-PGS), constructed from genomic variants associated with BMI weighted by their
          reported effect sizes from a BMI GWAS [13], is associated with body weight at different
          timepoints during childhood and adolescence. For example, individuals with an obesity-PGS
          in the top decile show significantly, but modestly higher birth weight (+60 grams) than
          individuals with an obesity-PGS in the bottom decile [15]. However, this difference in weight
          becomes more pronounced over time with 3.5 kg at age 8 years and 12.3 kg at age 18 years
          [15]. These findings highlight differences in growth associated with the polygenic liability to
          higher BMI.

               In summary, both AN and obesity have a genetic component that can be indexed by
          polygenic scores, and these genetic components are inversely correlated. However, it is
          unclear how genetic risk for both traits, individually and combined, affect growth
          developmentally during the first two decades of life. We identified individuals considered to
          be at high risk (defined as polygenic scores in the top deciles) for either AN or obesity and
          compared them with their peers with low polygenic risk on the same trait [16]. We then
          studied the longitudinal effects of the AN and obesity-PGS (separate and combined) on
          growth across development using data from ALSPAC.
               Specifically, the aims of this study were to determine the effect (separate and combined)
          of an AN-PGS [4] and obesity-PGS [17] on weight, height, and BMI, as well as fat mass
          index (FMI), lean mass index (LMI), and bone mineral density (BMD) growth trajectories
          during the first two decades of life in the longitudinal population-based ALSPAC study [18–
          22]. We hypothesized that a higher AN-PGS would be associated with below average growth
          trajectories for weight, BMI, FMI, LMI, and BMD. Previous studies reported no genetic
          correlation between height and AN and therefore a height trajectory was included as a
          negative control as we predicted no association with the AN-PGS (3). We also hypothesized
          that a higher obesity-PGS would be associated with above average growth trajectories.
          Lastly, we hypothesized that individuals with a high AN-PGS and low obesity-PGS would
          represent a subgroup at higher risk for poor growth (below average growth trajectories)
          compared to those with both a low AN-PGS and a low obesity-PGS.

          Methods
          Participants
                    The ALSPAC study is an ongoing population-based birth cohort (14,541 pregnancies)
          study of mothers and their children (that were born between 1 April 1991 and 31 December
          1992) residing in the southwest of England (UK) [18–22]. From the 14,541 pregnancies,
          13,988 were alive at 1 year. At age 7 years this sample was bolstered with an additional 913
          children. The total sample size for analyses using any data collected after the age of seven is
          therefore 15,454 pregnancies; of these 14,901 were alive at 1 year of age. Participants are
          assessed at regular intervals using clinical interviews, self-report questionnaires, medical
          records, and physical examinations. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap
          electronic data capture tools hosted at University of Bristol [23,24]. REDCap (Research
          Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based software platform designed to support data
          capture for research studies, providing 1) an intuitive interface for validated data capture; 2)
          audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export
          procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and 4) procedures
          for data integration and interoperability with external sources. Please note that the study

          dictionary at the following webpage: http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/.
          To avoid potential confounding due to relatedness, one sibling per set of multiple births was
          randomly selected to guarantee independence of participants (N = 75). Furthermore,
          individuals who were closely related to each other, defined as a phi hat > 0.2 (calculated
          using PLINK v1.90b), were removed. The authors assert that all procedures contributing to

          Consent for biological samples has been collected in accordance with the Human Tissue Act
          (2004). Informed consent for the use of data collected via questionnaires and clinics was
          obtained from participants following the recommendations of the ALSPAC Ethics and Law
          Committee at the time. The main caregiver initially provided consent for child participation
          and from the age 16 years the offspring themselves have provided informed written consent.
          Measures
                    Weight, height, and body mass index (BMI). Numerous measurements on weight and
          height were collected from different sources (i.e., routine clinic visits, information collected
          from midwives, linkage to child health records) between birth and age 24 years. Information
          on weight was collected at research clinic visits annually up to the age 14 years and further
          clinic measurements at the ages 16, 18, and 24 years using the Tanita Body Fat Analyzer
          (Tanita TBFUK Ltd.) to the nearest 50 grams. During the same clinic visits, height (standing)
          was measured to the nearest millimeter with shoes and socks removed using a Holtain
          stadiometer (Holtain Ltd, Crymych, Pembs, UK). The different measurements of weight and
          height were highly correlated across various methods [18]. Information on child and
          adolescent BMI (weight in kilograms / height squared in meters) was derived using weight
          and height measurement obtained during clinic visits.
                    Fat mass index, lean mass index, and bone mineral density (BMD). All ALSPAC
          participants were invited to undergo a whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
          scans using the Lunar Prodigy dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner as part of face-to-
          face visits at the ages of 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 24 years. Fat mass index was calculated by

          dividing total body fat mass (in kilograms) by height (in meters) squared. Similarly, lean
          mass index was calculated by dividing total lean mass divided by height (in meters) squared.
          Additionally, whole-body (minus head) BMD was also estimated using the Lunar Prodigy
          dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner.
          Trajectory modeling
          Censoring for the presence of an eating disorder
                    To derive the trajectories for each outcome, we censored for the presence of any
          eating disorder (ED); i.e., AN, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. Information on a
          probable ED was available at age 14, 16, and 18 years [see [25,26] for more information on
          how ED diagnoses were derived]. The presence of an ED diagnosis at age 14 years meant
          that all values for that individual regarding their measurement (BMI, FMI, LMI, etc.) at age
          14 years up to age 24 years were set to missing. This was also done for the presence of an ED
          diagnosis at age 16 years (set values at age 16 and beyond to missing), and 18 years (set
          values at age 18 and beyond to missing). Therefore, censoring did not lead to loss of
          participants in the analyses, but rather loss of observations (N = 1,055). This censoring
          allowed us to derive unbiased results in the following spline and trajectory modelling, while
          retaining the largest amount of data possible. This is important, as these models are sensitive
          to outliers and including individuals with EDs would be likely to introduce extreme values in
          the distribution.
          Spline modeling (Table S1 and Figure S1)
                    Prior to analyses, BMI values (Table S1 and Figure S1) were transformed using the
          natural log due to the right-skewed distribution of the data. Spline models involve placing
          spline points (knots) at time points during longitudinal data collection where the direction of

          growth changes. This is necessary as children’s growth in the first two decades of life is not
          linear, following a more complex pattern, rendering standard growth models unsuitable to
          accurately reflect the data [27]. The advantage of linear spline models is that they allow knot
          points to be fitted at different ages to derive periods of change (between the knots) that are
          approximately linear. After visual inspection of the BMI means at each time point, three
          spline points (knots) were placed creating the following periods of linear growth between:
          age 4 months and 1 year, age 1 year and 5 years, and age 5 and 24 years. The linear spline
          modeling resulted in four parameters (coefficients) which we will refer to as: intercept (BMI
          at age 4 months), slope 1 (age 4 months - 1 year), slope 2 (age 1 year - 5 year), and slope 3
          (age 5 year - 24 year; see figure S1). Spline models were obtained using STATA (v 15).
          Mixed effects modeling (Table S1 and Figure S1)
                    We used mixed effects models to estimate growth over time for weight, height, FMI,
          LMI, BMD [28]. For each outcome, we estimated two parameters per participant; an
          intercept (measurement of the body composition measure at age 10 years) and a slope (a
          measure of linear growth). Prior to estimation of the parameters we log-transformed weight,
          height, FMI, LMI, and BMD due the right-skewed distribution of the data. We also
          calculated the squared slope, to examine if a non-linear, quadratic shape was necessary to
          capture the change in measures across time. Data for FMI, LMI, and BMD were measured
          objectively at 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 24 years during face-to-face visits as described above.
          For uniformity among analyses, we restricted analyses of weight and height to measurements
          at these ages. Height was included to test the quality of methodological approach as a
          negative control for the association with the AN-PGS. Previous studies reported no genetic
          correlation between height and AN and therefore we do not expect an association between

          the AN-PGS and the height trajectory (3). Mixed effects modeling was carried out using
          STATA (v 15).
          Genotyping
                    Genotype data were available for 9,915 children out of the total of 15,247 ALSPAC
          participants. Participants were genome-wide genotyped on the Illumina HumanHap550 quad
          chip. Following quality control of the genetic data, a total of 8,654 participants with
          genotyping data and at least one outcome measure were included in the analyses (Table 1).
          Details of the quality control checks are described in the Supplementary information.
          PGS calculations
                    The AN-PGS was derived from the GWAS on AN by the Eating Disorders Working
          Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED; ncases = 16,992, ncontrols = 55,525)
          [4] and the obesity-PGS was derived from the obesity GWAS conducted by the Genetic
          Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT; ncases = 32,858, ncontrols = 65,839) [17]. The
          datasets will be referred to as the AN and obesity discovery cohorts, respectively. The
          calculation, application, and evaluation of the PGS was carried out with PRSice (2.1.3
          beta; github.com/choishingwan/PRSice/) [29,30]. PRSice relies on PLINK to conduct
          necessary cleaning steps prior to PGS calculation [29,31]. Strand-ambiguous SNPs were
          removed prior to the scoring. Clumping was applied to extract independent SNPs according
          to linkage disequilibrium and P-value: the SNP with the smallest P-value in each 250
          kilobase window was retained and all those in linkage disequilibrium (r2 > 0.1) with this SNP

          calculated then weighted by the effect size estimated from the discovery cohort. This was

          done separately of the AN and the obesity discovery cohort. PGS were calculated at nine
          different P-value thresholds; 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 1.
                    Furthermore, we derived a categorical variable using the AN-PGS and obesity-PGS as
          following; for each trajectory parameter, we first dichotomized the AN and the obesity PGS
          based on a cut-off value of the 8th decile of the scores. This value was selected based on
          previous studies that reported that individuals in top deciles of obesity-PGS and
          schizophrenia-PGS are at greater risk than those in lower deciles [15,32].We did not choose
          the highest decile as cut-off as this would have resulted in a small sample size for this
          particular bin and therefore a reduction in statistical power. Individuals with a PGS lower
          than the 8th decile were grouped into a “low PGS” group while those with a PGS score at or
          higher than 8th decile were grouped into a “high PGS” group. Considering that the PGS were
          calculated at nine different P-value thresholds (0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 1)
          we evaluated whether each individual would fall into the high or low group for each P-value
          threshold. Individuals the fell into the high PGS group consistently (five or more times) for
          the nine thresholds were grouped into the high PGS group with the remaining individuals
          grouped into the low PGS group; note that this was done separately for the AN-PGS and the
          obesity-PGS. Based on this grouping we were able to determine four categories; individuals
          with a (1) low PGS for both AN and obesity, (2) high PGS for AN and low PGS for obesity,
          (3) low PGS for AN and high PGS for obesity, and (4) high PGS for both obesity and AN.
          The “low AN-PGS/low obesity-PGS” group was used as the reference category in the
          analyses.

                    In the first set of analyses, we determined the association between the AN-PGS or
          obesity-PGS and each body composition trajectory parameter (i.e., intercept and slopes for
          the BMI trajectory splines and intercept, slope, and squared slope for the remaining
          trajectories). We stratified our analyses on biological sex and regressed each estimated
          parameter on the AN-PGS or the obesity-PGS adjusting for the first four ancestry informative
          principal components using linear regression models; phenotypic sex differences in body
          composition have been reported in the general population that are detectable as early as
          adolescence [33,34]. Considering that the BMI growth parameters are highly correlated, we
          included the intercept in the regression model of slope 1; intercept and slope 1 in the
          regression model of slope 2; intercept, slope 1, and slope 2 in the regression model of slope 3.
          Similarly, for the FMI, LMI, BMD, weight, and height trajectories, we included the intercept
          in the model of the slope; intercept and slope in the model of the squared slope. We report for
          each model the R2 (Nagelkerke’s Pseudo squared multiple correlation, a measure the
          proportion of variance explained) and the beta (as a measure of effect size, with 95%
          confidence intervals), and the percent change in outcome for the log-transformed outcome
          measures to ease the interpretation of the beta point estimates.
                    Correction for multiple testing was done by calculating False Discovery Rate-
          corrected Q-values [35]. The significance threshold was met if the False Discovery Rate-
          adjusted Q was < 0.05.
          Extreme group comparison of the polygenic score analyses
                    In the second set of analyses, we used linear mixed effects regression (LMER) to
          determine the association between the body composition measures (BMI, FMI, LMI, BMD,
          weight, and height) and the derived categorical AN and obesity PGS, using the lmer function
          from the lme4 package in R [36]. For each regression model, the derived categorical variable

          of the AN-PGS/obesity-PGS, age, and the first four ancestry informative principal
          components were included as fixed effects. We included random intercepts for each
          individual in the model, to take into account variance in body composition measures that is
          due to inter-individual differences. The analyses were stratified by sex given differences in
          body composition [34]. The “low AN-PGS/low obesity-PGS” group was used as the
          reference category in the analyses. Correction for multiple testing was done by calculating
          False Discovery Rate-corrected Q-values [35]. The significance threshold was met if the
          False Discovery Rate-adjusted Q was < 0.05.
          Post-hoc analyses of the extreme group comparisons
                    Based on the reported negative genetic correlations between AN and obesity [4] we
          also sought to understand whether the obesity-PGS could mitigate the effect of the AN-PGS.
          Therefore, we also carried out post-hoc of the above extreme group comparisons by
          specifically focusing on the difference between the “high AN-PGS / low-obesity-PGS” and
          the “high AN-PGS / high obesity-PGS”.

            Body mass index (BMI; weight in kilograms/height2 in meters) was calculated using objectively measured weight and
          height during a routine clinic visit at age 24 years. Height was measured to the nearest millimeter using a Harpenden
          Stadiometer (Holtain Ltd.) and weight was measured using the Tanita Body Fat analyzer (Tanita TBF UK Ltd.) to the
          nearest 50 grams.
          b
            Fat mass, lean mass, and bone mineral density (BMD) were derived using a Lunar Prodigy dual emission x ray
          absorptiometry (DEXA) scanner (GE Medical Systems Lunar, Madison, WI, USA). Fat mass index (FMI) and lean mass
          index (LMI) were calculated by dividing each measure (in kilograms) by height2 (in meters). Bone mineral density (BMD)
          was calculated for the whole body excluding the head values.
          Association of the AN-PGS with growth trajectories (Figure 1, Table 2)
                     We found several significant associations between the AN-PGS and growth
          trajectories (on the additive scale) exclusively in the periods of linear growth in female
          participants. Females with one SD higher AN-PGS had an on average 0.01% lower BMI
          trajectory between the ages 5 and 24 years. Furthermore, in females, on average a one SD
          higher AN-PGS was associated with a 0.001% lower FMI trajectory and a 0.05% lower
          weight trajectory between the ages 10 and 24 years. There was no significant association
          between the AN-PGS and the growth trajectories in male participants.

Figure 1: Associations of the anorexia nervosa (AN) and the obesity polygenic score with the body composition trajectory parameters stratified for biological sex in the Avon Longitudinal
Study of Parents and Children [18–22]. The depicted tiles reflect the % change in outcome for one SD increase in the standardized PGS for the associations that remained significant after
correcting for multiple testing using the Benjamini & Hochberg False Discovery Rate [35]. The PGS were calculated at P-value thresholds 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 1.
Presented here are the AN-PGS calculated at P-value threshold of 0.05 and the obesity-PGS calculated at a P-value threshold of 0.01; the results for the PGS calculated for the remaining P-value
thresholds can be found in supplemental Table S3. The body mass index (BMI) trajectory: was derived using spline modeling. Prior to deriving the trajectory, BMI was transformed using the
natural logarithm. For the spline modeling three spline points (Slopes) were placed: Slope 1, between age 4 months and 1 year; Slope 2, between age 1 year and 5 years; and Slope 3, between
age 5 year and 24 years. Intercept reflect BMI value at age 4 months. Fat mass index (FMI), lean mass index (LMI), bone mineral density (BMD), weight, and height trajectories: were
                                                                                                                                                                                                             (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
derived using mixed effects models [28]. Prior to trajectory modeling we log-transformed weight, height, FMI, and LMI (but not BMD) due the right-skewed distribution of the data. For each
trajectory, we derived for each participant two trajectory parameters, an intercept (measurement of the body composition measure at age 10 years), and a slope (a measure of linear growth). We
also calculated the squared slope, to examine if a non-linear, quadratic shape was suitable for the change in measures across time.

FMI, LMI, BMD, weight, and height trajectories were derived using mixed effects models [28]. For each trajectory, we derived for each participant two trajectory parameters; intercept
(measurement of the body composition measure at age 10 years) and a slope (a measure of linear growth). We also calculated the squared slope, to examine if a non-linear, quadratic shape was
suitable for the change in measures across time. The intercept and the slope were all allowed to vary randomly across individuals.

          Association of the obesity-PGS with growth trajectories (Figure 1, Table 3)
                    As early as age 4 months, a one SD higher obesity-PGS was associated with 0.58%
          and a 0.50% higher BMI trajectory in female and male participants, respectively. The
          obesity-PGS was also associated with periods of linear growth of the BMI trajectory between
          the ages 1-24 years, a one SD higher obesity-PGS was associated with a 0.01% higher BMI
          trajectory in females and males. At age 10 years, a one SD higher obesity-PGS was
          associated with a 7.74% higher FMI, 1.12% higher LMI, 0.94% higher BMD, 3.29% higher
          weight trajectory in females. Furthermore, in females, a one SD higher obesity-PGS was
          associated with a 0.02% lower slope in the height trajectory. We observed a similar pattern of
          results in males with a notable exception for the FMI trajectory in which a one SD higher
          obesity-PGS was associated with a 13.30% higher FMI trajectory; this is nearly double that
          observed in females. In addition, in males, a one SD higher obesity-PGS was associated with
          a 0.23% higher height trajectory at age 10 years; however, a one SD increase in the obesity-
          PGS also corresponded with a 0.01% lower slope for height trajectory between the ages and
          10 and 24 years.

BMI trajectory was derived using spline modeling. Prior to deriving the trajectory, BMI was transformed using the natural logarithm. For the spline modeling three spline points (Slopes) were
placed: Slope 1, between age 4 months and 1 year; Slope 2, between age 1 year and 5 years; and Slope 3, between age 5 year and 24 years. Intercept reflect BMI value at age 4 months.
g
    FMI, LMI, BMD, weight, and height trajectories were derived using mixed effects models [28]. For each trajectory, we derived for each participant two trajectory parameters; intercept
(measurement of the body composition measure at age 10 years) and a slope (a measure of linear growth). We also calculated the squared slope, to examine if a non-linear, quadratic shape was
suitable for the change in measures across time. The intercept and the slope were all allowed to vary randomly across individuals.

          Extreme group comparisons (Table 4)
                    Across both sexes, individuals grouped in the low AN-PGS/high obesity-PGS
          followed on average a higher growth trajectory between the ages 10-24 year compared to
          individuals with a low AN-PGS and a low obesity-PGS; the difference was most pronounced
          for the FMI trajectory in which female participants with a low AN-PGS and a high obesity-
          PGS had 12.95% higher FMI while male participants showed 25.6% higher FMI compared to
          the reference group with a low AN-PGS and a low obesity-PGS (Table 4). Furthermore,
          although these associations did not reach statistical significance, we found a trend in which
          female individuals with a high AN-PGS and a low obesity-PGS consistently had lower BMI,
          FMI, LMI, BMD, weight, and height trajectories compared to the reference category of
          individuals with a low AN-PGS and a low-obesity-PGS.
          Post-hoc analyses extreme group comparisons (Table 5)
                      In the post-hoc analyses of the extreme group comparisons we found that both
          females with a high AN-PGS and low obesity-PGS had on average 4.8% lower BMI, 16.99%
          lower FMI, 1.4% lower BMD, and 6.78% lower height trajectories compared to females with
          high PGS on both traits (Table 5). In males we found that individuals with high AN-PGS and
          low obesity-PGS had on average 4.61% lower BMI, 22.28% lower FMI, and 7.16% lower
          height trajectories compared to individuals with high AN-PGS and high obesity-PGS.

regarded as the “high PGS group” while those with scores lower were considered the “low PGS group”. Considering that the PGS were calculated at nine different P-value thresholds (0.001,
0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 1) we evaluated whether each individual would fall into the high or low group for each P-value threshold. Individuals that fell into the “high PGS group”
consistently (five or more times) for the nine thresholds were grouped into the “high PGS group” with the remaining individuals were grouped into the “low PGS group. From the dichotomized
AN-PGS and obesity-PGS we were able to create a categorical variable with four levels (1) low AN-PGS / low obesity-PGS (2) high AN-PGS / low obesity-PGS (3) high AN-PGS / high
obesity-PGS (4) low AN-PGS / high obesity-PGS. The “low AN-PGS/low obesity-PGS” group was used as the reference category in the analyses.

          Discussion
                    We report that common genomic variants associated with AN and obesity are
          significantly associated with growth trajectories during the first two decades of life. We
          found that the AN-PGS is associated with lower BMI, FMI, and weight trajectories in
          females but not males. We did not observe a significant association of the AN-PGS with the
          LMI nor with the BMD trajectory. In line with our expectations, the AN-PGS was not
          significantly associated with height trajectory (i.e., negative control [3,4]). In contrast,
          individuals with higher obesity-PGS had higher BMI, FMI, LMI, BMD, height, and weight
          trajectories during the first two decades of life. Further, by combining the AN-PGS and
          obesity-PGS we were able to distinguish subgroups within each growth trajectory. Females
          with high AN-PGS and low obesity-PGS deviated consistently below growth trajectories of
          female participants with low AN-PGS and obesity-PGS for all investigated trajectories;
          however, these associations were not statistically significant. However, females with high
          AN-PGS and low obesity-PGS had significantly lower BMI, FMI, BMD, and weight
          trajectories compared to individuals with high PGS on both traits.
               We demonstrate, with multiple measures of growth, that individuals with high AN
          genetic liability differ significantly in growth as marked by slower growth as early as age 5
          years for BMI and, as well as for FMI and weight trajectories between the ages of 10-24
          years. However, females with high AN-PGS and a low obesity-PGS did not significantly
          differ from the reference group with a low AN-PGS and low obesity-PGS, though the
          direction of difference was in line with what we expected; individuals with high AN-PGS and
          a low obesity-PGS have lower growth trajectories compared to the reference group.
          Interestingly, female participants with high genetic liability for AN and low genetic liability
          for obesity followed lower growth trajectories compared to individuals with high PGS on
          both traits, suggesting that the obesity-PGS might have mitigated the effects of the AN-PGS.

          This view is consistent with reports of a negative genetic correlation between AN and obesity
          [4,37]. Taken together, the findings from the univariate AN-PGS analyses and the findings
          from the extreme-group comparisons suggest that genetic liability for obesity exerts a
          modulating role in the association between the AN-PGS and growth trajectories. However,
          we cannot exclude that other PGS could also exert influence on these associations. Overall,
          our findings lend further support to an earlier report that found differences in growth
          trajectories that are associated with later onset of AN were detectable as early as age 2 years
          [7,38,39] . Importantly, this impact of genetic liability for AN arises prior to any diagnosis of
          the illness, highlighting that individuals at higher genetic risk for AN have slightly different
          growth development during childhood before the average of onset that typically occurs
          during early adolescence [1,7,38,39]. Sex differences in body composition have been well-
          documented in the medical literature in which males on average having higher lean body
          mass, BMD, and body height but lower fat mass than females [40]. These biological
          differences are driven by both environmental and genetic factors [34,41]. In a recent study,
          our group [41] reported a negative genetic correlation between body fat percentage and AN
          and that this genetic correlation was more pronounced in females than in males (female SNP-
          rg = −0.44, SE = 0.04; male SNP-rg = −0.26; SE = 0.04). Findings in this study are in
          agreement with our earlier work on this sample by showing that polygenic risk for AN is
          negatively correlated with growth trajectories in females but not in males. The observations
          from this study and our previous work [41] support a hypothesis that a specific set of
          common genetic variants may be differentially active in females and may increase the
          liability for AN. These results also underscore the importance of collecting adequate samples
          from males with AN and all EDs to ensure our ability to identify differential genetic effects.
               In this study we demonstrate that developmental changes in body composition may in
          part be driven by the AN-PGS as early as age 5 years and by the obesity-PGS by age 4

          months. Further, by decomposing BMI into its respective components (i.e., FMI and LMI)
          we report that the AN-PGS is significantly associated with FMI changes across development
          but not with LMI, suggesting that the AN-PGS might drive these changes in growth
          trajectories specifically via fat mass.
               That AN and obesity polygenic risk co-influence growth trajectories is a novel finding
          that encourages exploration of the underlying biology. Common genomic variants that are
          associated with AN or obesity are primarily expressed in central nervous system [4,13,42],
          suggesting that body mass is behaviorally influenced. This view is also supported by our
          previous work, showing that PGS for a higher BMI are associated with several adolescent
          eating behaviors including higher propensity to engage in binge eating [43]. Therefore,
          potentially, polygenic risk for AN or obesity may impact growth at least in part via eating
          behaviors.
               This study has several strengths including the large sample size (N =8,654 with genotype
          data and at least one outcome measure) and the prospective and repeat collection of objective
          body composition measures spanning more than 20 years. We included a negative control
          (i.e., the height trajectory was not associated with AN), adequately controlled for multiple
          testing, and controlled for potential genetic confounders using ancestry informative principal
          components. The use of spline modeling enabled modeling of BMI trajectories more
          accurately as growth throughout childhood is not linear. Further, by stratifying on gender, we
          were able to identify sex-related effects that otherwise would have been masked, and
          censoring on ED ruled out that growth changes during puberty were a consequence of an
          eating disorder.
               Findings from this study should be interpreted in the context of some limitations.
          Participants were recruited from the same geographical region in the south-west of England
          and therefore the results may not be generalizable to other populations. However, the

          homogeneity of this sample lends itself to genetic analyses as bias from population
          stratification is low [44]. Considering the longitudinal nature of the study, participants tend to
          drop out over time leading to missing data. We maximized available data by using mixed
          effects models, which allowed us to use all available data points in deriving the growth
          trajectories rather than only including complete cases. We acknowledge that any bias as a
          consequence of missing data in our analyses could have biased our results towards the null.
          The effect sizes observed in this study were relative small but are consistent with those
          previously reported in other PGS studies and aid our understanding of the disorder [15,45].
               In conclusion, our results suggest that polygenic risk for AN and obesity have detectable
          sex-related effects on growth during the first two decades of life. Especially, female
          participants with high polygenic risk for AN and a low polygenic risk for obesity likely
          constitute a high-risk group as they followed lower growth trajectories, which have
          previously been associated with AN in the ALSPAC sample [7]. This study adds to a
          growing body of evidence suggesting that risk for AN could emerge during early childhood
          and that a combination of AN and obesity polygenic risk could aid the early identification of
          individuals at high risk for AN. These findings encourage further research in understanding
          how the AN-PGS and the obesity-PGS co-influence growth during childhood in which the
          obesity-PGS can amplify or mitigate the effects of the AN-PGS.
