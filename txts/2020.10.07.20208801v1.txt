    Abstract
    Background: During health crises medical education is often derailed as was the case during the
    current COVID-19 pandemic. Medical trainees face the daunting task of having to gather, filter
    and synthesize new information about the evolving situation often without the standardized
    resources they are used to.
    Methods: We surveyed Canadian medical students, in the hardest hit province of Quebec, on
    how they were acquiring knowledge as well as what they knew of the pandemic. Google Forms
    was used, with the survey being distributed to each medical school in Quebec (McGill, ULaval,
    Udem) both through email and through social media pages for each class year. Two analyses,
    Mann-Whitney and ANOVA tests, were performed for year of study and degree obtained.
    Results: We received responses from 111 medical students from three universities, which
    represents 5% of the students invited to complete the survey. Students reported using mass media
    most frequently (83%) and also had a high rate of use of social media (to gather information
    about the pandemic. They rated these resources low in terms of their trustworthiness despite the
    high rates of use (average 2.91 and 2.03 of 5 respectively). Medical students also endorsed using
    more formal resources like public health information, scientific journals and faculty-provided
    information that they trusted more, however, they accessed these resources at lower rates. Of
    note, medical students had correct answered 60% of COVID-19 prevention strategies, 73%
    clinical correct answers, 90% epidemiological correct answers. Additionally, students who were
    training in the larger city of Montreal, where the worst of the outbreak was focused, tended to
    significantly perform better (p<0.0001) than their colleagues who were not located there.
    Conclusion: These finding indicate a wide use of information resources intended for public
    consumption rather than more rigorous and trustworthy sources. Furthermore, there seems to be
    a knowledge gap amongst medical students responding to this survey that suggests an
    opportunity to improve the delivery of educational content during this rapidly evolving
    pandemic.

    Introduction
    Medical students serve as an important part of the healthcare system’s future. During pandemics,
    however, their role is largely unclear. This is evident in Quebec medical schools, where during
    the SaRS-COV 2 (COVID-19) pandemic the third-year medical students were removed from
    clinical duties; where second-year medical students were exempt from their transition to
    clerkship practices; and where fourth-year students were not given any clear role in participating
    in healthcare services during this evolving crisis (1).
    Previous studies have noted that healthcare practitioners including students would be willing to
    volunteer in the event of a pandemic, a number which increased if given protective garments (2,
    3). Many attribute this willingness to a sense of professional obligation, as well as a need to be
    present when patients are most vulnerable even if students often feel their knowledge is lacking
    (4, 5, 6).
    In COVID-19 there has been confusion regarding the type of work available to students, their
    clinical duties, and the best means to assist, Partly, this is due to the evolving nature of the
    pandemic, with ever-changing guidelines and recommendations (7, 8, 9). A knowledge gap has
    been noted in other countries amongst medical students with regards to COVID-19 (10, 11, 12).
    Moreover, in previous pandemics, it was medical students that showed the greatest difference in
    knowledge (13, 14).
    Due to this gap in knowledge in other countries and decentralization of the knowledge that does
    exist, we were curious to investigate the perceptions and knowledge of medical students in
    Quebec, Canada. The province of Quebec held the distinction of having the highest prevalence
    rate for COVID-19 infections of all the provinces in Canada. The primary objective of this study
    is, therefore, to assess the level of COVID-19 clinical knowledge among medical students. This
    includes determining if students understand the lab findings, clinical presentation, and if they
    believe the myths in COVID-19. The secondary objectives include understanding what
    information sources students turn to, and the perceived trustworthiness of those sources. Finally,
    we were curious as to whether there is an association between students’ knowledge and prior
    degrees obtained.
    Methods
    Survey Development
    The survey was modified off of a validated survey used during the H1N1 pandemic, by
    University of Alberta (13) (Appendix A, English Version). This previous survey concentrated on
    the H1N1, however. We included more COVID-19 related questions such as epidemiology,
    prevention, and clinical information, as well as questions that assessed perceived trust in
    informational sources. We further asked questions about the students’ backgrounds, questions
    about laboratory findings, symptoms, treatment, and others about myths and early conspiracy
    theories. The questions themselves were verified to be the most up-to-date, using multiple
    sources and public health agencies to obtain accurate information including figures of COVID-
    19 prevalence (15, 16, 17).
    The survey was created on Google Forms (Google Form, Mountain View, California) with 55
    questions (Appendix A). 5-point Likert scales, with 5 being “always true”, 4 being “somewhat

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208801.this version posted October 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

    true”, 3 being “neutral”, 2 being “somewhat false”, and 1 being “always false” were used. This
    scale for some questions is necessary given the evolving nature of COVID-19 (15, 16). For
    example, whether COVID-19 can be transferred via infected animals was considered an evolving
    question with responses true, somewhat true, and neutral being valid as minks and humans have
    been shown to have some cross-infective potential with unclear consequences (23).
    True and false questions were available, as was the choice, “We don’t know.” The survey was
    internally tested against four medical students, and one staff physician. The survey was available
    in English and French. Only one response per student was allowed to avoid duplicate or
    contradictory information. During the ethics review process, it was requested that we remove a
    question on the trustworthiness of faculty documents, therefore, students do not rate their trust of
    faculty documents but can indicate it as a source of information.
    Ethics approval was received (A06-B41-20A) from McGill University.
    Data Collection
    The survey was distributed to each medical school in Quebec both through email and through
    social media pages for each class year (i.e. Med 1s, Med 2s, etc). Each school distributed the
    survey once, either in email or social media. Links were directly available in the associated post.
    The survey was sent out at varying times by the individual schools. McGill sent out the survey to
    its students on July 2nd, Université Laval on July 7th, and Université de Montréal on July 8th.
    Université de Sherbrooke did not respond to any requests, despite being contacted numerous
    times. The survey was closed on August 20th, 2020 for all schools.
    Statistical Analysis
    Only completed responses were collected for data analysis. All data was funneled into Excel
    (Microsoft, Richmond, Virginia). Mean scores were calculated. Independent sample t-tests were
    performed for differences in prevalence of COVID-19 (Montreal, with schools Université de
    Montréal and McGill University, vs Quebec City, with Université Laval). Two analyses, Mann-
    Whitney and ANOVA tests, were performed for year of study and degree obtained. For the
    multivariate testing, Likert responses always true and somewhat true were one group, and
    responses either true or false, somewhat false, and always false were combined according to a
    method by Bo Gong (24). STATA (StataCorp, Release V.15.1, College Station, Texas, USA)
    was used for all statistical analyses. P <0.05 were considered significant.
    The denominator for response rates was calculated using known class sizes (18), with an
    observed and expected dropout rate of students at approximately 5% (19). This consideration
    incorporates those who would see the survey on an online medium. A conventional response rate
    is usually calculated on national enrolment, estimated to be about 2.8% (20, 21).
    Results
    General
    Three of the four Quebec medical schools were represented by responses to the survey. One
    hundred and eleven students participated from a total of 2148 (5%), which is higher than national
    averages for one-time surveys (20, 21). Table 1 details the characteristics of the participants.

    Forty-eight (43.2%) were from McGill University, 34 (30.6%) from Université de Montréal
    (UdeM), and 29 (26.1%) from Université Laval (ULaval).
    The largest group were from year 3 (40, 36%), followed by year 2 (32, 28.8%). Sixty-six
    students (59.5%) had a Quebec Diploma of College Studies (DEC), which is given to a student
    after completion of a college program (22). Thirty had some form of bachelor’s degree, with 14
    (12.6%) having a Bachelor of Science and 13 (11.7%) an undefined bachelor’s degree. Only 15
    had an advanced graduate degree, with 12 (10.8%) having a Master of Science.
    Source and Perceptions of Information
    Medical students look to a number of different resources for information (Fig. 1). Responses
    were grouped into sources widely available to the public (Fig 1a, c) and those that could be
    considered for use by health professionals (Fig 1b, d). The most widely used public resource was
    the mass media (average [AVG] 4.07, standard deviation [SD] 0.83), followed by social media
    (AVG 3.09, SD 1.33). Family members were not a widely utilized source of information (AVG
    2.80, SD 1.21) (Fig. 1a). The most widely accessed scientific resource were public health
    agencies (AVG 3.94, SD 1.05), followed by scientific journals (AVG 3.47, SD 1.14), and finally
    faculty documents (AVG 2.59, SD 1.30) (Fig. 1b).
    Trustworthiness of publicly available resources were generally rated as not being trustworthy
    (Fig. 1c). Mass media come closest to a neutral rating (AVG 2.91, SD 0.99). The most
    trustworthy sources of information were scientific journals (AVG 4.40, SD 0.72) and public
    health agencies (AVG 4.39, SD 0.71) (Fig 1d). We also compared the use of a given source vs
    the reported level of trust (Fig. 2). Notably, mass media is most used but not widely trusted
    whereas public health documents were accessed at similar rates but were highly trusted.
    Transmission, Prevention, and Treatment Knowledge
    Students were asked to respond to questions about the transmission, prevention, treatment and
    basic epidemiology of the pandemic. Question categories were grouped and reported as the
    percentage of correct answers (Table 2). Student respondents did well with 77% correct answers
    on average for questions about transmission. They scored 69% on questions of prevention and
    only 64% when it came to questions related to treatment.
    Some specific questions about prevention revealed interesting results. For instance, 72 students
    (64.9%) knew that ten seconds of handwashing was not recommended, while 100 (90.1%)
    students responded correctly that 20-seconds was recommended. Other prevention strategies
    were also relatively well known: 88 students (79.3%) stated that quarantine was effective, 72
    (64.9%) stated masks were effective, however, only 63 (56.8%) knew that gloves were not
    necessarily effective.
    Treatment-related questions varied in accuracy of response and generally students did more
    poorly on these questions. For example, currently approved treatments such as dexamethasone
    (17, 15.3%) and remdesivir (23, 20.7%) were not widely known to be approved. However,
    unverified medical treatments such as azithromycin (92, 82.9%) and chloroquine (69, 62.2%)
    were known to be ineffective. Of note, medications like chloroquine, which have been noted to

    have an uptick in media attention, received more “we don’t know” (34, 30.6%) and statements of
    efficacy (8, 7.2%) than other medications.
    Clinical Understanding
    Questions related to clinic presentation, diagnostics and mortality were grouped. Correct answers
    were tabulated and are expressed as average correct +/- standard deviation (Table 2). Questions
    about clinical symptoms were answered with an overall 86% correct. Interestingly, a question
    about the most common symptom, cough, fever or anosmia was split with 46 respondents
    indicating fever (41.4%) and another 42 (37.8%) indicating cough as the most common
    symptom. The majority of students knew that COVID-19 patients could be asymptomatic (107,
    96.4%). Generally, questions related to risk factors and diagnosis were more poorly done with
    average correct rates of 63% and 64% respectively. In terms of mortality rates, most knew that
    influenza has a lower death rate (77, 69.3%), and Ebola was higher (78, 70.2%).
    Epidemiology
    Questions related to international and Canadian epidemiology were grouped. Average correct
    responses were calculated demonstrating good basic understanding of international and national
    epidemiology with 91% and 89% correct respectively (Table 2). Interestingly, ten students
    (9.0%), stated that Ontario had the highest prevalence of COVID-19 despite residing in the
    hardest hit province of Quebec.
    Comparison Groups
    Prevalence of COVID-19 in the Community
    Responses were divided according to where individuals attended medical school. Respondents
    who attended medical school in Montreal (UdeM or McGill) were grouped and compared those
    from ULaval in Quebec City. Overall, responses were largely similar. There were a few cases
    where statistically significant differences were recorded. In these cases responses from students
    attending medical school in Montreal tended to be more accurate (Table 3). ULaval students
    showed more incorrect assumptions regarding COVID, including that COVID-19 can be
    prevented by current vaccinations (AVG 2.172 vs 1.488, p=0.0439), prevented by natural
    vitamins (AVG 1.862 vs 1.317, p=0.0092), and prevented by drinking alcohol (AVG 1.448 vs
    1.158, p=0.0399). As a whole, however, the answers were still largely on the correct side of the
    Likert-scale.
    Year of Study
    Comparing by year of study yielded no significant difference in most knowledge, except for the
    fact whether chloroquine can prevent COVID-19 (p=0.0043). Third year students scored best
    (AVG 1.625, SD 0.867), followed by fourth year students (AVG 1.70, SD 0.922). Second year
    students scored the worst (AVG 2.438, SD 1.014). Furthermore, as the year of study progressed,
    students were less likely to learn from their family members (p=0.0029) or think of their families
    as trusted sources (p=0.0004) (Table 4).
    Degree Specific
    We further compared individuals who completed university degrees (Bachelors, Master’s, and
    PhD’s) vs those without university degrees (DEC) (Table 5). DEC holders showed significantly
    more trust (AVG 2.59 vs 2.44) in family, less use of scientific journals (AVG 3.17 vs 3.93), and

    less trust in public health (AVG 4.26 vs 4.6). Students entering medical school with a DEC also
    responded less accurately, on average, to questions on treatments such as the use of
    dexamethasone (AVG 1.89 vs 2.2) and remdesivir (AVG 2.15 vs 2.44).
    Discussion
    This is the first study, to our knowledge, that looks at the informational sources used by medical
    students in Canada to acquire new knowledge during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey
    results suggest that medical students obtain much of their information with social media and
    mass media, noting, however, that both are not trustworthy. Scientific journals and public health
    institutions were the most trustworthy, but not as widely accessed for information. One
    consideration for this result may be due to the higher levels of trust for the media amongst
    Canadians when compared to the United States (25). It is, of course, important to consider the
    ease of access for the information, which no doubt, contributes to high levels of social and mass
    media use.
    Previous international research has noted that among residents and students, there is a gap in
    knowledge surrounding COVID-19 (10, 11, 12), though in Canada, this is the first such
    investigation. It is certainly not surprising that there were some knowledge gaps as best practices
    were evolving quickly during the course of the study. Furthermore, the students surveyed were
    not allowed to be actively involved in the care of patients. A key question for educators is how to
    help students stay abreast of current knowledge during a rapidly evolving crisis.
    Still, the students did well but there are notable gaps in knowledge of treatment and prevention.
    Without a comprehensive understanding of pandemics, and with widespread use of unverified
    sources of information, there will be ongoing difficulty in providing accurate, evidence-based
    care by medical students (35). Some student-led initiatives, such as the Harvard COVID
    curriculum (26, 27) or a COVID-19 tracker (28), offer some sources for knowledge; however,
    they are not widespread.
    The apparent knowledge gap amongst students certainly does bring to question whether there
    was a missed educational opportunity. Would students have been more engaged in learning if
    they were actively involved in care? The stoppage of training that medical students in Canada
    experienced due to the pandemic could have possibly been turned into a global health and
    pandemic elective, thereby encouraging learning through in-person, workplace learning (36).
    Furthermore, it is important to note that previous studies have shown that social media offer
    opportunities for innovation in medical education (29). Often, there are associations with
    improved knowledge (30), and greater collaboration is possible (31). While many of the stories
    of COVID-19 and social media exacerbates myths and conspiracy (32), others in medical
    education used social media to create virtual committees and hubs of knowledge (33). Further
    research could look at the effect of the institution of Quebec-specific COVID-19 curriculum and
    its effect on knowledge, as well as the role of social media in COVID-19 among medical
    students.
    There are certainly limitations to this study. The data is self-reported, and subject to recall bias
    by the students. It is also a relatively small number of students from three schools all in the

    province of Quebec. The generalizability of the results are unclear. Despite this, this survey does
    provide interesting insight into knowledge and knowledge acquisition by medical students during
    this unprecedented time. Additionally, though the lockdown measures were mandated by law to
    be the same provincially in Quebec, their local application may have differed (34). Such a
    difference, even small, may help explain the differences in Quebec City and Montreal students
    due to more exposure to the news or other sources by Montreal students compared to lower-
    prevalence students in other geographical locations.
    Conclusion
    As the first study of its kind in Canada, the results suggest there are knowledge gaps and wide-
    spread use of unverified and poor informational sources like social media amongst medical
    students in Quebec, Canada. Temporary interruptions to the normal medical curriculum and
    global health crises provide different learning opportunities for health professionals. There is
    perhaps an un-tapped opportunity for medical schools to plan for future disruptions and how best
    medical students can be engaged and their learning enhanced.
