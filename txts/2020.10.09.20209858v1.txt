17   Abstract
18
19   During August 2020, we carried out a serological survey among students and employees at
20   the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), Japan, testing
21   for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We used
22   a FDA-authorized 2-step ELISA protocol developed by the Krammer Lab (1, 2) in combination
23   with at-home self-collection of blood samples using a custom low-cost finger prick-based
24   capillary blood collection kit. Although our survey did not find any COVID-19 seropositive
25   individuals among the OIST cohort, it reliably detected all positive control samples obtained
26   from a local hospital and excluded all negatives controls. Among our controls, we found
27   strong cross-reactivity of antibodies in samples from a serum pool from two MERS patients in
28   the anti-SARS-CoV-2-S ELISA. Here we show that a centralized ELISA in combination with
29   patient-based

31   website created a stream-lined procedure. Major parts of the workflow were automated on
32   a liquid handler, demonstrating scalability. We anticipate this concept to serve as a prototype
33   for reliable serological testing among larger populations.

35   Background and Introduction
36
37   At the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 emerged from Hubei province in southern China and
38   quickly spread across the globe. Due to its proximity and direct flight connections between
39   the epicenter in Wuhan and its capital Tokyo, the Japanese Nation was among the first to
40   experience cases of the disease outside China, documenting its first case on January 15, 2020.
41   In early April, as the tourism season in Okinawa began to ramp up, so did the new cases of
42   COVID-19 in Okinawa. A first wave of COVID-19 cases peaked at the moderate rate of 10
43   cases/day in mid-April (total number 132 cases), which was effectively reduced by 5 weeks of
44   lock-down measures to no additional cases within the next two months. From early August
45   on, however, a second, much stronger wave of infections has, at the time of this report,
46   culminated in more than 2,682 accumulated cases on the island (October 8, 2020). The
47   present study was conducted at the beginning of this second wave.
48
49              Serological surveys which detect the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
50   antigens can provide important information to the government for issuing health care
51   guidelines. At the beginning of April 2020, we obtained plasmids for coronavirus surface
52   antigens from the Krammer Lab at the Icahn School of Medicine (NY, NY, USA). We established
53   protein expression and purification in a mammalian cell line and set up an ELISA following the
54   2-step assay developed by the same group (1). Their assay has received emergency use
55   authorization by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) (2). We secured PCR-confirmed
56   human sera from COVID-19 positive patients at the local hospital as well as negative controls
57   from serum collected before December 2019. Once the assay itself was validated, we set up
58   partially automated sample handling on a robotic liquid handler, established a website with
59   a barcoding system for anonymous sample tracking, and conducted a serological survey of
60   staff and students at our institution.

61              In emergency situations such as during COVID-19, the health care system is under
62   stress; it cannot be expected that trained clinical personnel are available to draw patient
63   blood by venous puncture. Furthermore, non-essential human traffic in hospitals and other
64   health care institutions should ideally be limited to protect vital health care workers from risk
65   of exposure to potential carriers of the virus. To overcome this limitation, we distributed easy-
66   to-use, self-administered micro blood sampling kits to participants. The kit uses a single-use
67   safety lancet to collect a few drops of capillary blood from the participant’s finger. We show
68   that antibody titers obtained by micro blood sampling are equivalent to serum antibody titers
69   from blood drawn by conventional venous puncture. This low-cost, easily deployable self-
70   sampling method in combination with a highly sensitive and specific ELISA in a centralized
71   testing lab provides a scalable solution that can enable serological surveys of larger
72   populations.

74   Methods
75
76   Protein Expression and Purification
77   Plasmids for mammalian expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) protein receptor-binding
78   domain (RBD, residues 319-541) and stabilized His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 S including a T4 foldon
79   trimerization tag were generously provided by Florian Krammer and colleagues at the Icahn
80   School of Medicine (NY, NY, USA) (3). Proteins were expressed in Expi293F cells and purified
81   by Ni-NTA affinity and size-exclusion chromatography as described previously (1). The yield
82   was 15 mg/L and 4 mg/L for RBD and the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S, respectively. 500 µL aliquots
83   of purified protein at a concentration of 10 µg/mL were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
84   at -80 °C until use. We expressed and purified both the SΔcs (furin cleavage site deletion RRAR
85   to A) and SΔcspp construct (cleavage site deletion and stabilizing mutations K986P and V987P)
86   (3), but only the SΔcs protein was used in this study. Protein purity was verified by SDS-PAGE
87   and confirmed by Western blot with MonoRab™ Anti-His Tag (C-term) Antibody (Nr. 25B6E11,
88   GenScript, USA).
89
90   Electron microscopy
91   The quality and folding of two proteins, the RBD and SARS-CoV-2 S, were verified by
92   biochemical methods and correct folding and assembly of the trimeric spike protein was

 93   confirmed using cryo-electron microscopy (Figure 1). Sample solution was applied to a carbon
 94   coated copper grid and stained with 1 % uranyl acetate. The protein particles were visualized
 95   with a Talos L120 transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) operating
 96   at 120 kV acceleration voltage.
 97              For cryo-EM, 3 µL of purified trimeric spike sample solution was applied to UltrAuFoil
 98   R1.2/1.3 grids pre-treated with a Solarus advanced plasma system (Model 950, Gatan, USA)
 99   for 60 seconds at 25 °C in a 23 % H2, 77 % O2 gas mix. The grids were blotted and vitrified in a
100   Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) using a liquid ethane-propane mixture. Cryo-
101   EM grids and particle density were optimized by screening based on protein concentration in
102   the range of 2-3 mg/mL. Particles Images of trimeric spike protein in amorphous ice were
103   collected with a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US)
104   operating at 300 kV on a Falcon-3EC camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) in counting mode,
105   at a pixel size of 1.08 Å (at the specimen level). Frames from 1,479 movies were aligned, dose-
106   weighted and summed using motioncor2 (4). Contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation,
107   particle picking and 2D classification were performed with RELION 3.1 (5). A total of 1,119,504
108   particles were picked semi-automatically, of which 297,144 particles were retained after 2D
109   classification.
110
111   Sample collection and heat inactivation
112   The micro blood sampling kits were assembled in 8x12 cm sealable plastic bags, including BD
113   MicrotainerⓇ contact-activated lancet (Becton Dickison, NJ, USA), blood collection tube
114   containing a coagulant and a separator gel (Greiner Bio-one MiniCollectⓇ TUBE 0.5/0.8 CAT
115   Serum Separation Clot Activator gold cap), packaged alcohol wipes, adhesive bandage, and
116   peelable sticker with a linear tube barcode (Code 128) and a matching QR code encoding a
117   link to our website. After finger prick with the safety lancet, users collected 1-5 drops (approx.
118   30-150 µL) of capillary blood into the serum separation tube and attached the linear barcode.
119   Serum separation tubes were centrifuged at 5,000╳g for 5 min at 4 ºC under biosafety level
120   2 (BSL2) conditions, then inactivated in a water bath at 56 ºC for 1 hr. Heat-inactivated
121   samples were stored at 4 ºC until use for ELISA. After scanning tube barcodes for each plate

122   into a CSV file with a hand-held scanner, separated serum was transferred into barcoded 96-
123   well plates using manual pipetting.
124
125   ELISA and automation
126   We followed the 2-step ELISA protocol developed by the Krammer lab (1). ELISA plate formats
127   were modified as depicted in Supplemental Figure 1C. Modified plate designs included two
128   dilution series of positive control, which provided an internal standard. Additional negative
129   controls were included to provide a cutoff that was consistently within the suggested range
130   of 0.15-0.2 AU (Absorbance Units) at 492 nm.
131              We implemented a partially automated workflow on a Beckman Biomek FXP (Beckman
132   Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) liquid handling robot for two steps of the ELISA protocol,
133   namely, for (i) dilution and transfer of serum samples for RBD screening plates and for (ii)
134   plate developing and reading of all plates. Plates were stacked to maximize throughput and
135   usage of available deck space. Automated dilution and transfer of serum samples utilized a
136   96-well plate containing 5X diluted serum in PBS, termed the D1 (dilution 1) plate as a source
137   plate. Sample from the D1 plate was diluted with a PBS-T milk solution in a second 96-well
138   plate, termed the D2 (dilution 2) plate, and finally transferred to the destination ELISA plate
139   according to the published protocol (1). After dilution, D1 plates were immediately wrapped
140   in parafilm and stored at 4 ºC. If a given sample tested positive against RBD antigen in step 1,
141   a fresh 5x diluted sample was prepared using solution remaining in the serum separation
142   tubes. If the volume of the remaining serum was insufficient, the 5x diluted sample from the
143   D1 plate was used for the confirmatory step 2.
144              For automated plate development and reading, 100 µL of SigmaFastTM OPD
145   development solution (Sigma Aldrich) was prepared according to the described protocol and
146   added to all wells. A wait time was programmed in the liquid handler workflow so that exactly
147   10 minutes after addition of OPD, 50 µL of 3 M HCl were added to quench the reaction.
148   Immediately after addition of HCl to a given plate, the plate was automatically loaded into
149   and read on a DTX800 multimode plate reader (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) at
150   492 nm wavelength. Functions were added within the automation code to automatically
151   calculate threshold values for each plate and output a “positive” or “negative” result for each

152   sample. All other steps, including washing on an AquaMax 4000 plate washer (Molecular
153   Devices LLC, San Jose, CA, USA), were carried out manually.
154
155   Controls and Standards
156   Three positive controls in the form of intravenous blood sera from confirmed SARS-CoV-2
157   PCR-positive patients (collected 10-30 days post onset of symptoms) were obtained from
158   Naha Municipal Hospital, Naha, Japan. After titer analysis of all three samples (data not
159   shown), the two samples with the strongest titers were pooled and used as the positive
160   control for all assays. Positive controls (collected at least 90 days after onset of symptoms)
161   for validation of the capillary blood collection method were obtained from Okinawa Chubu
162   Hospital, Uruma City, Japan. Negative controls taken from patients prior to November 2019
163   were obtained from Naha Municipal Hospital from intravenous blood, and from a commercial
164   serum pool (Human Serum from human male AB plasma, Sigma Aldrich H4522-100ML, Batch
165   #SLCD1948, serum was pooled prior to August 2019). Human MERS-convalescent serum and
166   SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (NIBSC code 20/130) were obtained from the National
167   Institute of Biological Standards and Control, UK.
168
169   Calculation of thresholds
170   The threshold for each step 1 plate was defined as the average of the negative controls plus
171   3 standards deviations of the negative controls as described previously (1). The average and
172   median threshold for all step 1 plates was 0.161 AU and 0.166 AU, respectively. Initially, the
173   threshold for the step 2 plate was calculated in the same manner as step 1. However, the
174   threshold calculated with only three negative controls was below the recommended range
175   (0.15-0.2 AU at 492 nm). Therefore, another threshold, calculated as 4-times the average
176   blank, which has been demonstrated to be valid for identifying anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-
177   positive samples was used instead (6). Average and median threshold for all step 2 plates
178   were 0.196 AU and 0.1868 AU, respectively.
179
180   Calculation of predictivity values
181   The positive predictivity value (PPV) describes the likelihood that a sample which tests
182   positive is a true positive. The negative predictivity value (NPV) describes the likelihood that

192   Website-based platform for test application and anonymous results reporting
193   Test results were disseminated using a custom web application developed by the OIST IT
194   section and deployed through Microsoft Azure cloud. The front page (Supplementary Figure
195   1B) contained a disclaimer, an instructional video (Supplemental Information), a printable
196   instruction sheet, and other basic information for participants.
197              The QR code printed and included in each blood sample collection kit was encoded
198   with a unique web URL corresponding to the sample ID of the sticker placed on the sample
199   tube (Supplemental Figure 1A). Following a simple user flow (Supplemental Figure 2),
200   participants could check their test results anonymously either by scanning the QR code with
201   a smartphone or by entering the 6-digit sample ID matching the linear tube barcode.
202              Upon inputting a valid sample ID, participants were prompted to accept a disclaimer
203   before viewing results. After accepting the disclaimer, participants were able to retrieve the
204   status of their sample, including guidance on interpreting test results. Optional information
205   about gender, prior symptoms, age, travel history could be entered voluntarily. This metadata
206   was        collected          anonymously               through         a    survey        on     the       SurveyMonkey
207   (https://www.surveymonkey.com) platform and linked to the sample ID which was passed as
208   a hidden field via the participant’s web browser. Each sample ID was stored in a database
209   table along with values representing test results and disclaimer acceptance. The web
210   application queried this database to retrieve the status of the requested sample ID. The
211   sample IDs were composed of six characters generated randomly from the set of

214   randomly selected. Some additional security features, such as request rate limiting, were
215   implemented to restrict the use of automated tools to retrieve results for all possible sample
216   IDs. Basic functions were developed to allow batch import and export of test results in a
217   delimited text format, allowing easy transfer of data between the testing system and the web
218   application database.

220   Sequence alignments
221   The full-length sequences of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV S protein (UniProt ID: P59594 and K9N5Q8,
222   respectively) were aligned pairwise using ClustalW2, against the SΔcs sequence (3)
223   (Supplementary Figure 3).
224
225   Human subject research approval
226   The experiments were conducted according to a proposal approved by the OIST human
227   subjects ethics committee (application HSR-2020-026).

229   Results
230
231   Protein preparation and validation
232   SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) were expressed in
233   mammalian cells and purified. The quality was verified by Western blot and electron
234   microscopy. We performed single particle cryo-EM and 2D-image classification. This
235   confirmed that the trimeric spike protein was properly folded and assembled (Figure 1).

247   Validation of micro blood sampling method.
248   Serum samples are typically separated from intravenously collected blood. To confirm that
249   the finger-prick method neither causes unforeseen complications nor affects assay sensitivity,
250   blood samples from two confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive individuals were taken both
251   intravenously and by finger-prick on the same day. Although these samples were collected at
252   least 92 days post exposure, they retained a high antibody titer comparable to positive
253   controls, which were collected 10-30 days post onset of symptoms.
254              The MiniCollectⓇ capillary blood collection tube contains a prefilled volume of a
255   polymer gel with a lithium heparin coagulant, which induces blood clotting and can separate
256   the blood clot from serum by centrifugation. Separated serum from four samples were tested
257   in a dilution series in duplicate on both an RBD-coated ELISA plate and a trimeric spike-coated
258   ELISA plate according to the “step 2” ELISA protocol (1) (see Methods and modified plate
259   layout in Supplementary Figure 1C). For both individuals, titers of intravenous and capillary
260   blood were similar on both the RBD-coated and the spike-coated plate (Figure 2).

266              samples both intravenously and also by micro-blood collection at least 90 days post
267              exposure. Each sample was tested in duplicate on the same ELISA plate, either coated
268              with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (left) or with SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein (right).

272              2019.
273
274   Serological Survey
275   Overall, 675 sample tubes were collected and processed. Among all the samples received,
276   zero samples showed signal above threshold in both the RBD screening plate and the spike
277   confirmatory plate.
278              Samples were typically collected, serum separated, and heat-inactivated at the end of
279   each day. Nonetheless, most blood samples can be stored at room temperature in the serum
280   separation tube for several days, in some cases with larger blood volume for up to 1 week.

281   Longer than 1 week is not recommended because the blood begins to dry up. Antibody titers
282   after serum separation have been reported as stable for up to 6 weeks when stored at 4 °C
283   (8). Some participants had difficulty collecting their blood by themselves. In such cases, we
284   encouraged participants to visit the nurses in our institute’s Health Center for assistance.
285              The results for RBD ELISA step 1 are summarized in Figure 3A. Intensities were scaled
286   with respect to the threshold for each plate. Results were compared with multiple negative
287   controls and a collection of serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive individuals. A subset
288   of 63 OIST samples had serum antibody reactivity above the established threshold, and only
289   a few were at the same level as the PCR-positive individuals. Titers from all PCR-positive
290   individuals were above the threshold. Samples from all PCR-positive individuals were taken
291   by capillary blood collection at least one month post onset of symptoms.
292              Results for the final ELISA step 2 are shown in Figure 3B. Of the 63 OIST samples that
293   were positive in RBD step 1, all had serum antibody reactivity below threshold for all 5
294   dilutions when tested against the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein in step 2, indicating a
295   9.9% false positive rate in the highly sensitive step 1. Samples from all PCR positive individuals
296   were above the threshold for at least two dilutions. Results were classified as “positive”
297   (above threshold), “negative” (below threshold), or “undetermined”. The most common
298   cause of an undetermined result was the failure to provide sufficient serum. This was the case
299   for 40 of the 675 samples that we received. If the result was undetermined, the participant
300   was encouraged to pick up another kit and try again.
301              From the SurveyMonkey platform, 206 completed surveys were received, or 31 % of
302   all samples collected. The collective results showed that 17 % of the survey takers believed
303   that they had experienced some COVID-19 symptoms in the past 6 months and 31 % had
304   travelled outside of Okinawa in the past 6 months. The age distribution was as follows: 20-40
305   years old, 60 %; 40-60 years, 36 %; greater than 60 years, 4 %. The gender distribution was
306   roughly equal.

310              OIST samples were above the threshold (3 standard deviations above the average
311              negative control). B. All positives from step 1 were tested in step 2 (anti-spike ELISA).
312              No OIST samples were above the threshold (4 times the average background). C. Step-
313              2 titers were measured at dilutions 1:100, 1:300, 1:900, 1:2700, and 1:8100. Positive
314              controls showed much stronger signal than the OIST samples even at high dilution.
315              The dotted line indicates the respective threshold level. All negative controls are

318
319   Assay Specificity
320   The specificity of the Mount Sinai Hospital Clinical Laboratory COVID-19 ELISA Antibody Test
321   has been reported as 100 % for 74 negative control samples (9) and the developers
322   demonstrated no cross-reactivity against the common coronavirus strain NL63 (3). Of note,
323   as part of the protocol establishing process, we used a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma
324   (NIBSC code 20/130) and human MERS-convalescent serum to confirm the specificity of the
325   assay in both steps. As expected, SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma showed strong reactivity
326   in both plates. MERS-convalescent serum, on the other hand, was negative in anti-RBD cross-
327   reactivity, but positive in anti-spike cross-reactivity (Figure 4).

329   To understand the basis of the MERS-convalescent serum cross-reactivity, we performed an
330   amino acid sequence alignment of SARS-CoV-2 spike and MERS-CoV spike protein. Sequence
331   alignment demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD shares 18.7 % identity with MERS-CoV RBD,
332   but alignment of the full-length spike sequence demonstrated higher 32.3 % sequence
333   identity between SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV (Supplementary Figure 3).

342   Discussion
343
344   Micro blood sampling is a good alternative to venous blood collection
345   Micro blood sampling by finger prick at home avoids unnecessary risk and effort by healthcare
346   workers and allows parallel collection of large numbers of samples within a short period of
347   time. The combination of patient-driven sample self-collection with a standardized highly
348   specific and selective ELISA in a centralized lab improves the reliability of results while keeping

349   costs low. Serum can be separated from whole blood up to 1 week after collection. Provided
350   that temperatures are kept close to ambient temperature, this would allow for shipping of
351   samples from collection site to the testing site by mail. The main bottleneck is serum transfer
352   from collection tube to ELISA plate. This step may be accelerated with a sophisticated
353   integrated liquid handling system. We showed that antibody titers from capillary blood serum
354   are equivalent to titers measured from venous blood (Figure 2). The Infectious Diseases
355   Society of America Guidelines on the Diagnosis of COVID-19 currently make no
356   recommendations for or against the use of capillary blood in serological assays due to a
357   knowledge gap on the subject (10). We hope that the success of our study begins to fill this
358   knowledge gap, paving the way for further proof-of-concept studies using capillary blood. Our
359   survey revealed that micro blood sampling of capillary blood is a practical, cost-efficient
360   method using as little as one drop of blood (approximately 30 µL) per sample. Such a small
361   sample volume would even allow testing of newborns using neonatal heel prick.
362
363   Anonymization and web-based reporting
364   The web-based platform served as an efficient means to conduct this study anonymously
365   while providing instructions and communicating results to participants. Anonymization was
366   achieved by randomly barcoded samples without the need to enter personal data. From the
367   1,154 staff and students at OIST (as of May 2020), 675 samples were received, of which only
368   41 samples (6.1%) could not be tested due to lack of serum or improper sample collection.
369   The success of our practical web-based method indicates that this method may be used for
370   larger epidemiological studies.
371
372   Significance of OIST results
373   The serological survey of students and employees carried out at OIST on Okinawa, Japan, in
374   August 2020 revealed no seroconversion among this small population. The test has reliably
375   identified all previously confirmed PCR-positive individuals and controls, with reactivities as
376   high as 7 times threshold. Our results assert strong confidence in this 2-step assay, which has
377   received FDA-emergency approval (2).
378              Okinawa has, thus far, enjoyed moderately low numbers of COVID-19 cases among its
379   population. Other recent serological surveys in Japan, have found seroprevalence as low as
380   0.43 % (among 44,066 employees and business partners of the company Softbank and

381   healthcare workers across Japan) (11), 0.1 % (1,971 citizens of Tokyo), 0.03 % (3,009 citizens
382   in Miyagi Prefecture) and 0.17 % (2,970 citizens of Osaka prefecture) (12). At such low
383   seroprevalence, high assay specificity is critical to achieving a high predictive value (13, 14).
384   Although accurate estimation of the actual seroprevalence among OIST staff and students
385   (including the 45 % of employees that did not participate in the survey) is not possible,
386   assuming a seroprevalence between 0.03 % (Tokyo) and 0.43 % (Softbank), with a known
387   assay specificity of close to 100 % and a sensitivity of 92.5 % for the Mt. Sinai Antibody Test
388   used here (9), we estimate the negative predictivity value of our assay to be greater than
389   99.9%.
390              SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses such as NL63 use aceE2 as
391   receptor (15, 16) mediated by the class-1 fusion protein S before entry through the plasma
392   membrane, or via a clathrin-dependent endosomal pathway (17). MERS-CoV utilizes a similar
393   mechanism but uses the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor (dpp4) instead (18). Dpp4 does not
394   share sequence and structural similarity to previously identified human coronavirus receptors
395   such as ACE2 or APN (15, 16, 19). Convalescent plasma samples from SARS-CoV-infected
396   patients have moderate cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but no cross-
397   neutralization (20). The assay used here has been shown to have no cross-reactivity with the
398   seasonal human coronavirus NL63 (3). Interestingly, when we tested human convalescent
399   serum from MERS patients with our ELISA, we found explicit cross-reactivity between MERS
400   serum and SARS-CoV-2 spike with an antibody titer similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 plasma. Our
401   sequence alignment indicated only 18.7 % sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and
402   MERS-CoV RBD. On the other hand, we found 32.3 % identity between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-
403   CoV spike (S) (Supplementary Figure 3), indicating higher sequence conservation in the other
404   domains of the spike protein, thus providing a possible explanation for the observed cross-
405   reactivity. For a given SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum sample with an anti-spike titer of
406   >1:1350, the probability of viral neutralization at the FDA-recommended level for
407   convalescent plasma used for COVID-19 treatment (viral neutralization titer ≥1:160), has been
408   found to be ≥80 % (21). Our data shows strong MERS cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 spike
409   at titers close to 1:1350. Although most effective neutralizing antibodies against
410   coronaviruses target the RBD, neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S1-N-terminal
411   domain (22) and SARS-CoV S2 domain (23) have also been identified. Our data suggests that
412   MERS convalescent serum may also contain such neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
