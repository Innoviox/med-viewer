  Abstract
  Background: Little is known about within-person frailty index (FI) changes during the last
  years of life. In this study, we assess whether there is a phase of accelerated health deficit
  accumulation (terminal health decline) in late-life.
  Material and methods: 23,393 observations from up to the last 21 years of life of 5,713
  deceased participants of the AHEAD cohort in the Health and Retirement Study were assessed.
  A FI with 32 health deficits was calculated for up to 10 successive biannual assessments (1995-
  2014), and FI changes according to time-to-death were analyzed with a piecewise linear mixed
  model with random change points.
  Results: The average normal (pre-terminal) health deficit accumulation rate was 0.01 per year,
  which increased to 0.05 per year at approximately 3 years before death. Terminal decline began
  earlier in women and was steeper among men. The accelerated (terminal) rate of health deficit
  accumulation began at a FI value of 0.29 in the total sample, 0.27 for men, and 0.30 for women.
  Conclusion: We found evidence for an observable terminal health decline in the FI following
  declining physiological reserves and failing repair mechanisms. Our results suggest a
  conceptually meaningful cut-off value for the continuous FI around 0.30.

  Introduction
  Frailty has major implications for clinical practice and public health[1], and is defined as a
  vulnerability towards drastic health deterioration among older adults due to a cumulative
  decline in multiple physiological systems[2]. Specifically, it is thought that the gradual decline
  in physiologic reserves associated with normal aging accelerates in frailty, and consequently,
  homeostatic mechanisms start to fail. For frail older adults, even minor stressors can therefore
  result in disability[3], hospitalization[4] or death[5]. The established frailty index (FI)[6, 7],
  one of the most common and robust frailty assessment tools[8], measures an older person’s
  whole health based on the number of accumulated health deficits. For the FI, the number of
  present deficits a person has accumulated is divided by the total number of deficits considered
  (e.g. 6/30 = 0.20). In theory, the FI ranges from 0 (fit) to 1 (frail), but the empirical near-
  maximum (99th percentile) FI is consistently found below 0.70[9-11]. It is thought, that at this
  point, homeostasis reaches its limit, so that any additional health deficit cannot be sustained and
  would likely result in death. While this endpoint of the FI continuum is well established, it is
  less clear when frailty begins, that is, the tipping point[12] when homeostatic mechanisms start
  to fail and health deficit accumulation increases consequently. In other words, we are interested
  in when the pre-terminal phase characterized by stability or only minor health decline is
  replaced with the terminal phase of more rapid health decline which ends with death[13].
  Currently, rather little is known about FI changes in late-life, and specifically during the last
  year(s) of life, that is, according to time-to-death (TTD), a time metric which better
  characterizes late-life health changes than time since birth (chronological age)[14]. The few
  available studies suggest, that the FI correlates more strongly with TTD than age[15], that there
  is likely a rapid FI-increase during the last year(s) of life[16,17], that individuals with higher FI
  scores accumulate further deficits more slowly compared to more robust older adults who catch-
  up during the very last years of life[18], and that men accumulate deficits near their time of
  death whereas this is extended over a longer period of time in women[19]. However, most of
  this evidence stems from cross-sectional analyses of a limited number or proportion of deceased
  older adults. To actually date and quantify the hypothesized acceleration in the rate of health
  deficit accumulation before death, non-linear within-person FI-changes during the last years of
  life should be assessed in a representative sample of deceased older adults for whom TTD is
  known. In this study, we perform such an analysis to answer whether there is an acceleration in
  the FI before death, how large it is, and when this typically occurs.

  Materials and methods
  Data
  The oldest cohort (AHEAD) of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS)[20] provides
  population-representative longitudinal data for community-dwelling older adults in the United
  States and a near-complete mortality follow-up. AHEAD participants, who were born before
  1924 were interviewed regarding their physical, functional, cognitive and psychological health
  biannually from 1993 onwards. Sufficient data for the calculation of the FI was available from
  1995 (=baseline) to 2014, which resulted in a maximum of 10 repeated observations per person.
  When respondents were unwilling or unable to be (re-)interviewed, often due to medical or
  cognitive problems, a proxy respondent, usually a close family member, could provid
  information. Mortality follow-up for AHEAD participants based on the national mortality
  register lasted until August 2017 with a completion rate of 96.8%. During this period, 5846
  (91.2%) of the AHEAD participants died with a known date of death, which constitutes the
  sample for this analysis.
  Variables
  A frailty index (FI) was calculated from 32 identical health deficits in each wave
  (Supplementary Table 1) according to standard protocol[21]. The health deficits covered
  multiple physiological systems, and included chronic diseases, limitations in (instrumental)
  activities of daily living, mobility restrictions, symptoms, BMI-deficit, sensory impairments,
  and self-rated health and memory. All health deficits had less than 5% missing values, and the
  FI was calculated only for participants who provided valid information for at least 80% of the
  health deficits, which amounted to 97.3% (n=5,713) at baseline. Other variables were time to
  death (years), chronological age (years), age at death (years), and sex (male/female).
  Statistical Analysis
  First, we calculated descriptive statistics to assess characteristics of FI values at baseline,
  follow-up waves, and at the last available measurement before death. Second, based on the
  pooled sample, we plotted non-linear FI trajectories by both chronological age and TTD using
  restricted cubic regression splines to obtain an overview of FI changes in late-life. Third, to
  analyze longitudinal within-person changes and to pinpoint when the normal (pre-terminal)
  health deficit accumulation rate is replaced by the hypothesized accelerated (terminal) health

  deficit accumulation rate, we applied a piecewise linear mixed model with random change
  points[22], a type of model often used to differentiate pre-terminal from terminal declines in
  cognitive functioning[23]. Specifically, this model takes the form of
                               FIij = β1i + β2i(tij −ωi)I(tij ≤ωi) + β3i(tij −ωi)I(tij > ωi) + εij
  where observed FI measurements for the ith person (i = 1, ..., N) at time points tij (j = 1, ..., ni)
  measured in years are modeled as a function of the individual-specific intercept (β1i), i.e. the
  expected FI value at the change point, the individual-specific normal (pre-terminal) FI slope
  (β2i) before the change point, the accelerated (terminal) individual-specific FI slope (β3i) after
  the change point, and the timing of the individual-specific change-point (ωi) itself. The
  individual-specific parameters consist of the population-average or fixed (β10,β20,β30, and ω0)
  effects and the random effects, that is, the individual-specific deviations from the population-
  level effects (u1i,u2i,u3i, and u4i) which account for both the heterogeneity between individuals
  and the autocorrelation between the varying number of repeated observations. Given the known
  sex-differences in the FI in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies[24], we furthermore
  stratified all analyses by sex. All models were estimated with ’brms’ (v.2.11.1), a front-end for
  ’RStan’ (v.2.19.2) in R: A language and environment for statistical computing (v.4.0.2).

  Results
  Median age at baseline was 78.9 (IQR=8.4) years, and 60.6% of the sample were women. Mean
  age at death was 89.0 (SD=6.2) years among women and 86.9 (SD=6.0) years among men.
  Median time of follow-up before death was 5.3 years (IQR=6.8, range=0-21.4) and the mean
  number of repeated assessments before death was 4.1 (SD=2.5, range=1-10). Specifically, 993
  respondents (17.4%) provided only one FI assessment, 914 (16.0%) two, 853 (14.9%) three,
  680 (11.9%) four, 606 (10.6%) five, 526 (9.2%) six, 472 (8.3%) seven, 286 (5.0%) eight, 220
  (3.9%) nine, and 163 (2.9%) all ten assessments. In total, the 5,713 participants provided 23,393
  observations. The median time between the last interview and time of death was 1.4 (IQR=1.2)

  years. 40.8% of the participants (n=2,329) were interviewed during their last 12 months, and
  19.9% (n=1,136) even during the last six months of their life.
  At baseline, mean/median FI values were 0.25/0.21 (SD=0.15/IQR=0.17) for men and
  0.28/0.25 (SD=0.16/IQR=0.21) for women, and 95th/99th quantiles were 0.57/0.73
  respectively 0.61/0.74. During follow-up, FI values increased with each subsequent assessment
  (Supplementary Figure 1). FI scores at baseline followed the characteristically right-skewed
  and sex-specific distribution typical of community-dwelling samples (plot A in Figure 1),
  whereas the distribution of FI values from the last available observation was more normal (plot
  B in Figure1), resembling clinical samples. FI values increased with both chronological age and
  TTD (plots C and D in Figure 1) but stronger and more progressively so with TTD (partial
  Pearson-r between FI and TTD adjusted for age=-0.29, p<0.001) than age (partial Pearson-r
  between FI and age adjusted for TTD=0.16, p<0.001). During follow-up, as sample size
  decreased,        the      proportion         of     proxy-interviews       increased         (e.g.  1995/1996=12.4%,
  2004/2005=20.0%, 2014/2015=40.5%). Participants who provided fewer repeated observations
  were frailer on average at baseline (Supplementary Figure 2).

  The main results of this analysis, based on the piecewise linear mixed regression models, are
  shown in Table 1 and plot E in Figure 1. These show that the normal (pre-terminal) rate of
  health deficit accumulation of 0.01 per year increased five-fold (terminal decline) and that this
  change in pace occurred about 3 years before death. Terminal decline was steeper and occurred
  later in men compared to women. The average FI value at the onset of the accelerated health
  deficit accumulation phase was 0.29 (CI-95%=0.29-0.30) in total, and 0.27 (CI-95%=0.26-
  0.27) for men and 0.30 (CI-95%=0.30-0.31) for women. This means, women had both a longer
  terminal phase and were frailer during this period. Despite a steeper rate of health deficit
  accumulation in men after the change point, a gap between men and women remained at the
  end: estimated mean FI values right before death were 0.41 (CI-95%=0.40-0.42) among men
  and 0.48 (CI-95%=0.47-0.49) among women. However, due to the mean distance of 1.4 years
  before death in the assessments and the (bi-)linear nature of model, these are likely a down-
  biased estimates.

  Discussion
  In this study, we analyzed whether, how, and at which point before death the rate of health
  deficit accumulation in the FI accelerates. Frailty is thought to result from an accelerated decline
  in available physiologic reserves as these are increasingly required to compensate for changes
  associated with normal aging[24]. In consequence, repair mechanisms start to fail due to
  exceeding recovery time and damaged recovery processes[7], which leads to ever more

  unrepaired deficits. In this paper, we argue that failing repair mechanism should manifest soon
  in an empirically detectable acceleration of the rate of health deficit accumulation in late-life.
  To uncover this change in pace, we partitioned the observed FI trajectories towards death in a
  large sample of deceased participants with the help of a statistical model into a normal (or pre-
  terminal) and an accelerated (or terminal) rate of health deficit accumulation. The central
  conclusion that can be drawn from our results is that the health deficit accumulation rate indeed
  accelerates substantially about 3 years before death and that the average change or tipping
  point[12] in the FI that separates normal ageing from terminal decline was close to 0.30 in our
  study.
  We interpret this within-person change in pace of late-life health deficit accumulation as the
  transition point into or the onset of frailty within the inherently continuous FI[6]. This
  interpretation is compatible with the verbal descriptors “frail” of the last three categories of the
  Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), which begins with “mildly frail” and an associated mean FI of
  0.27[26]. Our results can be tied back to the issue of a cut-off value for the FI. The question
  whether an old person is frail or not (yes/no) is important for both clinical practice, e.g.
  screening for frailty to prognosticate risk and balance between benefits and harms of
  interventions, and public health, e.g. with regard to frailty prevalence[1]. Therefore, various
  cut-offs for the presence of frailty in the FI have been suggested, e.g. 0.20[21], 0.25[27], or
  0.35[28], although these round numbered cut-offs have little conceptual or empirical grounding.
  Our results suggest a cut-off close to 0.30, which is higher than the most often referenced FI-
  cut-off of 0.25, and (slight) differences between men and women. Hoogendijk et al.[29] recently
  also suggested a higher cut-off for women than men based on the ability to predict mortality.
  The FI cut-off values in that study, however, were lower compared to the present study, which
  may be due to country and/or methodological differences, particularly the fact that we assessed
  the FI multiple times within the same individuals and included only deceased participants.
  The results of our study also relate to findings from previous research regarding FI dynamics
  in late-life. We found that women had consistently higher FI values throughout their last years
  of life, and that the phase of accelerated health deficit accumulation was a more drawn-out
  process among them compared to men who accumulated health deficits faster during the very
  last years of life[19], which is in line with the known male-female health-survival paradox[24].
  Also, we were able to confirm a higher correlation of the FI with TTD compared to age[15],
  and that there is indeed a substantial increase in the rate of deficit accumulation in late-life – a
  five-fold increase amounting to two additional deficits per year in the terminal phase – as

  begins[17]. According to a recent systematic review[30], this phase begins with the onset of
  terminal decline, which, according to our results based on a measure of a person’s whole health
  (the FI), would be around 3 years before death. These results are compatible with findings from
  studies on the onset of terminal decline in cognition[31] and motor function[32]. To the best of
  our knowledge, our study is the first to comprehensively assess changes in the FI in relation to
  TTD – including the estimation of the timing of accelerated health deficit accumulation – which
  adds to the existing literature both regarding FI dynamics and regarding terminal decline[13]
  more generally.
  In our analysis, the sub-maximum FI-limit (99% percentile) was slightly above 0.70 and thus
  higher than in most studies[9-11]. This is likely due to the fact, (1) that we used a sample of
  deceased older adults of advanced age (median age at baseline was 79 years), (2) that we did
  not exclude participants who dropped out of the study during follow-up as mixed models make
  use of all available observations, and (3) that we included participants whose FIs were
  calculated based on information from proxy-interviews when the original participant would or
  could not participate due to severely impaired physical and/or cognitive health. Indeed, if based
  on self-reported data alone, FI scores were lower on average and the sub-maximum limit at
  baseline was 0.65 instead of 0.74. Proxy-interviews from close family members and caregivers,
  however, can be a reliable alternative source of information[33] in case of compromised health
  among the oldest old, and both increase statistical power and reduce selection bias[34], which
  is particularly important for the study of health changes in late-life. Future studies should assess
  the reliability and impact of including proxy-interviews with regard to the FI more thoroughly,
  for example regarding FI trajectories and the relationship with adverse health outcomes.
  In this study, we relied on the same methodological framework that is used for the assessment
  of terminal decline in cognitive functioning[23], i.e. we tracked FI changes over TTD
  postdictively among deceased older adults. Since, the date of death is not known in advance,
  however, the information provided in this study of an accelerated health deficit accumulation
  rate in the very last years before death is of limited direct clinical relevance. Nonetheless, the
  FI cut-off values suggested by our study, and the characteristics of the accelerated rate of health
  deficit accumulation add to the understanding of late-life frailty dynamics, and could also be of
  predictive use. Future studies based on routinely collected data in clinical practice could, for
  example, assess steep, ’terminal-like’ acceleration in FI growth as an indicator that a critical
  tipping point[12] in a patient’s health has been reached.

  The current study has several strengths. First, this is the first study to analyze the timing of the
  onset and the size of terminal health decline in the FI based on extensive longitudinal data.
  Second, we provided a conceptually meaningful empirical estimate of a cut-off value for the
  FI. Third, our analysis was based on a considerable number of repeated FI observations from
  decedents of a large, population-representative cohort with near-complete mortality. This is
  important because TTD – which better characterizes late-life health changes than age[14] – is
  known only among decedents and a low proportion of deceased sample participants after only
  a few years of follow-up would be selective and likely lead to biased FI estimates.
  However, there are also several noteworthy limitations to this study. First, it is unclear whether
  the results based on the oldest cohort in HRS – all participants had to reach at least age 72 to be
  included – generalize to later birth cohorts and other geographic contexts. Previous research
  has indicated considerable cross-national differences in FI dynamics[36] as well as increased
  FI values among later birth cohorts[36] which, together with varying life-expectancy may lead
  to different results. Thus, our calculations should be repeated with other long-running,
  population-representative, cohort studies with near complete mortality such as the Longitudinal
  Aging Study Amsterdam[38], or the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study[11]. Second, due to the
  inclusion of proxy-respondents, we could not include any performance-based or psychological
  health deficits, which may lead to an underestimation of frailty levels[39]. Third, despite the
  comparatively high retention rate and the considerable proportion of proxy-interviews in HRS
  compared to other studies, its biannual cycle and the high median age at baseline resulted in
  relatively few available repeated observations per person (around four on average). This
  forestalled, for example, estimating the correlation coefficients between individual-level
  (random) effects – and to assess whether frailer older adults have less steep terminal
  acceleration rates and vice-versa as suggested by Rockwood et al.[18] – since the model would
  not converge upon adding six additional individual-effect parameters. Fourth, the non-trivial
  temporal distance between the last FI assessment and death limits our ability to reliably assess
  FI-changes in the very last year of life. The last two limitations may be remedied only with
  more intensive population-level data (e.g. 10+ repeated quarterly assessments during the last
  years of life), which might become available in the near future from routinely collected primary
  care electronic health records[17,35].
  Conclusion

  To conclude, this study conducted in a large cohort of deceased older adults indicates that the
  rate of health deficit accumulation accelerates substantially in the last three years of life before
  death, which we interpret as the consequence of steeply declining physiologic reserves and the
  onset of failing repair mechanisms. According to our results, acceleration of health deficit
  accumulation begins on average at an FI value close to 0.30, which we thus suggest as a
  conceptually meaningful and empirically derived cut-off value for the presence of frailty in the
  continuous FI.

                                Supplementary Figure 1: Frailty index by HRS wave
  Black boxplots refer to men, grey boxplots refer to women. The boxes represent the interquartile range (IQR,
  covering data from the 25th-75th percentile), the whiskers extend 1.5*IQR from the hinges. Single dots refer to
  outlying observations beyond the whiskers. Boxes are segmented by the median and the notches around the
  median indicate its 95% confidence interval. Note that sample size decreased with each wave:
  n1995/1996=5,713, n1998/1999=4,598, n2000=3,737, n2002/2003=2,925, n2004/2005=2,280, n2006/2007=1,695,
  n2008/2009=1,201, n2010/2011=706, n2012/2013=438, and n2014/2015=191.
