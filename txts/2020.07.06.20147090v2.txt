    ABSTRACT
    Simple plastic face shields have numerous practical advantages over regular surgical masks. In
    light of the spreading COVID-19 pandemic, the potential of face shields as a substitution for
    surgical masks, as a recommendation to the general population, was investigated In order to
    determine the efficacy of the protective equipment we used a cough simulator that was carefully
    tuned to replicate human cough in terms of droplet size distribution and jet velocity. The protective
    equipment considered was placed on a manikin head that simulated human breathing. An
    Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) was used to analyze the concentration and size distribution of
    small particles that reached the manikin respiration pathways. Additionally, water sensitive papers
    were taped on the tested protective equipment and the manikin face, and subsequently
    photographed and analyzed. In the case of frontal exposure, for droplet diameter larger than 3 μm,
    the shield efficiency in blocking cough droplets was found to be comparable to that of regular
    surgical masks, with enhanced protection for portions of the face that the mask does not cover.
    Additionally, for finer particles, down to 0.3 micron diameter, a shield was found to perform even
    better, blocking about 10 times more fine particles than the surgical mask. When exposure from
    the side was considered, the performance of the shield was found to depend dramatically on its
    geometry. While a narrow shield allowed more droplets and aerosol to penetrate in comparison to
    a mask under the same configuration, a slightly wider shield significantly improved the
    performance. The ability of a shield worn by an infected person in order to protect others in his
    vicinity was also investigated. A shield, and alternatively, a surgical mask, were placed on the
    cough simulator, while the breathing simulator remained totally exposed. In both cases, no droplets
    or particles were found in the vicinity of the breathing simulator.

    INTRODUCTION
              Pathogen-laden aerosol transport triggered by expiratory events such as coughing,
    sneezing, or talking, fundamentally contributes to the spread of the disease and to its potential of
    becoming an epidemic (Jones. 2020, Morawska and Milton. 2020). The study of the processes
    involved in such expiratory events and investigation of the efficiency of related personal protective
    equipment (PPE) are therefore crucial.
              The COVID-19 pandemic that has spread worldwide in just a few months has challenged
    public health policymakers in many different aspects. The ultimate objective for controlling the
    pandemic on the national level is a lowering of the infection rate, such that on average, an infected
    person will infect less than one other person, and thus eventually end the spread of the disease. In
    this respect, lowering the rate of spread, even modestly, can greatly contribute to the overall control
    of the disease. For that reason, PPE that is considered insufficient in the occupational context,
    focusing on the well-being of healthcare workers operating in a highly contaminated environment,
    can make a considerable difference when the problem at hand is controlling an epidemic over
    mass-population scales.
              The advantages of face shields over regular surgical masks are numerous. While surgical
    masks have limited availability and are disposable, face shields can be reused and are easily
    cleaned. They are comfortable to wear, retain less dermal facial heat, have no impact on breathing
    resistance, are less claustrophobic and inexpensive (Roberge. 2016). They reduce the potential for
    autoinoculation by preventing the wearer from touching their face, and essentially protect the
    entire face and not only the expiratory pathway (CDC and NIOSH. 2015). Also, use by a large
    fraction of the population of protective equipment which is slightly less effective but more

    comfortable or simple to wear may be more beneficial, in the public health context, than more
    effective equipment which is less comfortable or cumbersome. With these considerations, a face
    shield, although only partially protecting the users, can reduce the rate of infection, and may be
    adopted by more users due to its relative comfort (Perencevich et al. 2020).
              Motivated by these concepts, this work examines the potential of face shields as the sole
    protective equipment used by the entire population, instead of surgical masks. It is important to
    emphasize that for health-care workers face shields should generally not be used alone, but rather
    in conjunction with other protective equipment and are therefore classified as adjunctive PPE
    (Roberge, 2016).
               Droplet formation during an expiratory event like coughing, sneezing, talking, or even
    breathing, is a complicated process which involves complex flow through the different expiratory
    pathways. When a rapid airflow passes over a wet boundary, strips of liquid are lifted from the
    boundary, and then shredded and torn into droplets. The final droplet size distribution depends
    upon the fluid velocity, the pathways’ topology, the boundary wetting, and physical attributes of
    the mucus (Gralton, et al., 2011). Spray created by different expiratory events has been studied in
    different aspects. Yang, et al., (2007) measured the cough droplets size distribution by having
    volunteers cough into airbags, and subsequently analyze the droplet size of the contents. Their
    measurements yield a droplet number size distribution with a mode at 8.35 µm. More controlled
    experiments conducted by Morawska, et al. (2009) took into account the droplet dynamics between
    exhalation and measurements and found a different size distribution. The size distributions
    observed for different expiratory events were measured, and the authors suggest that every
    observed distribution is a combination of four distinct distributions, each characterized by a
    specific mode. Specifically, a cough event involves two main modes, at 0.8 µm and at 1.8 µm.

              The ejected air stream during a cough event creates a jet. The velocity immediately outside
    the mouth is greatest, and decreases further downstream. Specifying a jet velocity is therefore a
    matter of definition. The common way of defining and measuring the velocity in coughing and
    sneezing events is to estimate arrival times at a given distance using imagery techniques. Tang, et
    al., (2013) used a shadowgraph imaging technique combined with high speed photography and
    reported velocities around 4.5 m/s for coughs.
              An earlier comprehensive work which studied the level of protection provided by face
    shields (Lindsley, et al., 2014; 2010; 2013) used a cough simulator, a breathing simulator, and an
    optical particle counter to estimate the amount of spray inhaled by a susceptible person in the
    vicinity of a cough event. The inhaled, droplet-laden air was transferred into the particle analyzer,
    and the total inhaled mass was determined as a function of time. The study concludes that wearing
    a face shield substantially reduces the number of inhaled particles in the short term, but in the
    longer term, very small particles bypass the shield and are inhaled.
              The current study utilizes a cough simulator and besides monitoring inhaled fine particles,
    also provides further insight into several aspects. First, infected droplets can impact on other parts
    of the face and initiate subsequent transmittance. To address this, water-sensitive papers (see
    below) were taped on the manikin head and on the tested PPE. This method enables the
    simultaneous assessment of the spatial distribution of droplets impacting different parts of the face.
    Second, several configurations of the simulators were tested, including height and orientation
    differences. Finally, a shield was placed on the coughing simulator itself to assess the amount of
    protection provided to adjacent individuals when an infected person is wearing the shield. This
    issue is very important in the current context since COVID-19 can be transmitted by non-
    symptomatic infected individuals.

              It is important to stress that there are significant differences in all parameters of the ejected
    spray formed by expiratory events among different individuals and different scenarios. Therefore,
    the typical parameters chosen for this work do not represent every individual case.
              It is also worth noting that studying the fate of droplets and aerosol originating in an
    expiratory event is by itself insufficient to assess probability of infection. Droplets of different
    sizes are created in different locations in the respiratory tract and, consequently, pathogen load is
    non-uniformly distributed among different droplet sizes in a way that depends on the specific
    pathogen and expiratory activity (Gralton et al. 2011, Fennelly. 2020). Therefore, this work
    focuses on the comparison between different PPE, rather than in assessing the probability of
    transmittance.
    METHODS
              The experiment was performed in a 200 m3, air conditioned room, with the experimental
    setup (see Figures 1 and 2) positioned in the middle of the room. Typical background flow velocity
    in the room is 2-8 cm/sec. Background particle number concentrations were in the range of 2-4
    particles/cm3. An airbrush diffuser [Iwata Eclipse SBS] was used as a source of droplets spray.
    Controlling the operation duration (1 second) allowed calibration of the amount of released liquid.
    The pressure of the diffuser (here, 3 bars) was adjusted to provide a jet speed of about 5 m/s, typical
    for a cough event (Tang, et al., 2013). The ratio between the flow rate of air and liquid into the
    instrument was calibrated to obtain the desired size distribution. The released mass in each of the
    cough simulations was 100 μl, which is the upper limit expected from a real cough.

              Adjusting the jet direction and estimating the spray exit velocity were done by high-speed
    photography using a Photron high-speed digital camera at 4500 frames/sec. The jet velocity was
    estimated by measuring the time for the plume to propagate a given distance. The instantaneous
    size distribution of airborne droplets produced by the airbrush diffuser was monitored by a laser
    diffraction system, “Spraytec” [Malvern Panalytical – Malvern, Worcestershire, UK]. Mass and
    number distributions as measured 30 cm from the diffuser are shown in Figure 3, where the
    different colors indicate different repetitions. Minor differences between repetitions arise mostly
    as a result of the unsteady flow generated by the jet. The spray number distribution is characterized
    by diameters of 1.29, 1.76, and 6.51 μm for the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles, respectively.
    Additionally, the droplet volume distribution diameter is characterized by 8.87, 22.25, and 280.64
    μm for the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles, respectively. Three modes can be observed in the
    volume distribution, at 2, 20, and 620 μm, with Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of 1.5, 35,
    and 630 μm, respectively. The main mode in the number distribution is consistent with the reported
    measured distribution for cough events (Morawska et al., 2009)
              It is worth noting, that observed distributions of cough-generated droplets include sizes of
    up to a few hundred micrometers (Xie et al. 2009). In contrast, our cough simulator is limited to
    droplets smaller than 100 μm. However, large droplets are inertial and ballistic, and their increased
    presence in real cough events would therefore lead to an increase of the actual blocking efficiency.
              A mechanical breathing machine (piston pump, self-production, see Figure 2), with a
    standard medium-sized manikin head [Dräger, Ltd.], located downstream from the diffuser, was
    used to simulate a respiring person. The breathing waveform was sinusoidal with a flow rate of 21
    liters per minute (1.1 liter per a single breath). The simulated coughs were timed to the moment of
    maximal intake in the breathing simulator cycle.

              The location of the breathing simulator was set at 60 cm, simulating a distance of mutually
    interacting individuals. In order to take into account height differences between the infected and
    the susceptible individuals, some trials were conducted where, besides the 60 cm horizontal
    distance, a vertical distance of 30 cm was set by shifting the cough simulator up or down.
              The measurements were performed in two phases. The first phase was designed to assess
    the blocking efficiency against inhaled fine particles, while in the second phase, droplets
    potentially impacting the whole face were detected.
              In the first phase, several tens of repetitions were conducted for each PPE, which included
    a surgical mask [Shengguan LTD.], two face shields (FS4 and FS5, see Table 1), and a N95
    respirator (MOLDEX LTD.) which filters fine particles and was used as a reference. Additionally,
    some trials were conducted without any PPE.
              Tests were carried out mainly for a frontal configuration, in which the manikin head
    directly faced the airbrush. In order to test the significance of orientation, some tests were
    performed for a side configuration with the manikin head facing perpendicular to the jet direction.
    During the first phase, the breathing simulator and the cough simulator were at the same height.
              Monitoring fine particle concentration was conducted using an APS 3321 instrument [TSI-
    Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA]. Two alternate setups were performed. In the first, the air very
    close to the mouth of the manikin head was sampled through a thin tube (see Figure 2). The tube
    was connected to the APS instrument by a 30 cm vertical segment, following a 20 cm horizontal
    segment extending to the exterior part of the mouth through the gap between the mask\shield and
    the head. In the second setup, the APS was directly connected to the base of the manikin head,

    instead of to the breathing machine. The APS maintains a steady flow rate of 5 l/min into the
    instrument.
              For particles around 1 μm or larger, loss rate 𝛽(sec-1) of particles in the horizontal tube can
                                                                                                      3 𝑑2 𝑔𝜌

                                                                                                         18𝜇
    radii, 𝑑 and 𝜌 are the particle diameter and density, 𝜇 is the dynamic viscosity of air, and 𝑔 the
    acceleration of gravity. The mean flow velocity inside the tube is around 1 m/s, thus the particles
    spend only about 0.2 seconds in the horizontal segment of the tube. Within that time, the fraction
    of particles deposited in the tube is 1 − exp(−0.2𝛽), which, for particles of 2, 5, and 7 μm, yields
    tolerable loss fractions of 0.8%, 5%, and 9%, respectively.
              The APS instrument monitors continuously, with a time resolution of 1 second, and
    provides the particle number concentration and size distribution (between 0.3 to 20 μm). To ensure
    sufficient concentration of very fine particles, the cough simulator used 0.25 gr/L NaCl in an
    aqueous solution.
              In the second phase, yellow, water sensitive papers [Quantifoil] that change color upon
    contact with water provided an indication of droplets reaching different areas on the manikin head.
    The papers were taped (see Figure 2) on the shield and on the manikin face at six representative
    regions: forehead, nose, chin, left cheek, right cheek and neck. Different face shields were
    examined (Table 1), and again, for reference, a surgical mask was also tested. In the latter case,
    papers were taped on the nose and the chin. For some of the runs, the manikin head was shifted 30
    cm up or down, or, alternatively, placed facing perpendicular to the jet. Each trial was repeated
    twice. After the absorption of droplets onto the water sensitive papers, the papers were
    photographed using a digital camera (Nikon D810) with macro lens (Nikon Macro D 105 mm).

    Following a former work (Lindsley, et al., 2014) which showed that about 90% of the total spray
    mass accumulates during the first few seconds, the papers were collected immediately after each
    trial, and photographed within one hour after exposure. The photographs were analyzed (by Image
    Pro Plus Version 10.0, Media Cybernetics, Maryland USA) to determine the number of droplets.
    In order to determine the smallest pre-impact diameter that could be identified on the water
    sensitive papers (in our case, 3 μm), we used the method described in Hoffmann and Hewitt (2005).
              The protection efficiency of a face shield was assessed by testing its ability to block the
    droplets from reaching the face. This is achieved by counting the droplets on the face and on the
    shield for every specific run. Equation (1) defines the blocking efficacy, evaluated separately for
    each run, as the percentage of the number of droplets deposited on the shield (Nabove ), relative to
    the total number of droplets on the shield and face (Nbelow ) together.
                                                                          Nabove

              It is worth elaborating here on the utilization of Equation (1) in the current work. The
    straightforward way of evaluating the total mass of fluid impacting the face and shield is through
    addressing the size distribution of the droplets found on the papers. Here, an alternative and simpler
    way was followed: It is reasonable to assume that a small droplet, moving in the airstream, has a
    greater chance of reaching the face than a large inertial droplet flung at the shield. Therefore, the
    blocking efficacy, Equation (1), provides a lower bound for the percentage of mass of
    contaminated fluid blocked by the shield.

     RESULTS
              Fine particle penetration- phase 1
              Figure 4 presents a typical APS signal showing 3 sequential repetitions. The typical time
    interval after a simulated cough event when a concentration above the room’s background could
    be identified is around one minute. Maximal concentrations were observed around 10 seconds after
    the cough event onset.
              The number of simulated cough events for each of the PPE tested during the first phase of
    measurement was 20, 21, and 11 for frontal exposure tests of the face shield, the surgical mask
    and the N95 respirator, respectively. Also, tests of a regular face shield (FS4), an extended face
    shield (FS5) and a surgical mask (5 tests each) were performed for side exposure. Additionally, 30
    repetitions were conducted with no protection. Changes in the probing locations of the APS (see
    Methods) did not have a significant influence on the results and therefore the results are presented
    without addressing this issue.
              As a simple measure of particle infiltration, we define 𝐶𝑚 (𝑛), as the maximal number
    concentration for repetition 𝑛 (peaks in Figure 4). In the same way, 𝐶𝑚 (𝑛, 𝑑) is the maximal
    number concentration for a specific size bin, 𝑑. In order to compare different PPE or
    configurations, we also define an ensemble average which is the maximal number concentration
    for particles of size bin 𝑑, averaged over all 𝑁𝑝 repetitions associated with a specific PPE or
    configuration (𝑝).

    N95 respirator, and for the cases with no protection. For fine particles up to a diameter of about

    2.2 μm (Figure 5A), the dependence of the concentration on particle size is qualitatively similar
    for the different cases, with a slight decrease in amplitude moving from no protection to surgical
    mask, and a more significant decrease moving further to the N95 respirator and the face shield
    tests. For particles larger than about 2.5 μm (Figure 5B), the surgical mask and the face shield
    cases exhibit similar behavior, with substantially lower concentrations, up to about two orders of
    magnitude, compared to the case of no protection. For these larger particles, the lowest
    concentration values were attained with the N95 respirator.

    median, the blue squares indicate the second and third quarter, and the extreme horizontal lines
    describe the first and ninth decile. Median values for cases with no protection, a shield, a surgical
    mask, and a N95 respirator are around 750, 40, 450, and 100 particles/cm3, respectively.
    Additionally, results for side exposures with a mask, a shield (FS4), and an extended shield (FS5)
    are shown. For these cases, median concentrations were 650, 2000, and 30 particles/cm3,
    respectively.
    Despite the considerable scatter among different repetitions, a few conclusions are evident:
         ● For the frontal exposures, an advantage of face shields in comparison to surgical masks can
              be seen. While the surgical mask reduces the number of inhaled particles by roughly a
              factor of two, the face shield provides better protection and blocks more than 90% of the
              otherwise inhaled particles.

         ● The performance of the regular shield (FS4) in blocking particles dramatically depends
              upon the orientation of the manikin head. For side exposures, shield FS4 does not seem to
              provide any protection.
         ● The extended shield (FS5) provides good blocking even for side exposure.
    Droplet impaction- phase 2
              During the second phase, the blocking efficacy was estimated through the analysis of water
    sensitive papers and applying equation (2). Figure 7 presents the overall average blocking efficacy
    for each tested scenario (excluding the neck area which was not covered completely).
              As evident from Figure 7, when frontal exposure is considered and without vertical
    separation, the blocking efficacy is higher than 90% for all face shields and also for the mask. As
    noted above, these findings apply to droplets of diameter larger than 3 μm, which is consistent
    with the APS observations (see Figure 5) showing similar blocking capabilities of the surgical
    mask and the face shield for large particles.
              In contrast, in trials which include a vertical distance between the cough and breathing
    simulators, the blocking efficacy is as low as about 45%. However, one should note that for such
    events, the overall number of deposited droplets is relatively low.
              The three bars on the far right in Figure 7 refer to side exposures. All PPE block fewer
    droplets in this orientation than in comparison with frontal exposure, possibly due to penetration
    of inertial droplets through the side gap (between the face and the mask/shield), which is directed
    towards the source. The potential advantage of properly designed visors is reflected by the

    improvement in the blocking efficacy of the extended shield (FS5), which is substantially higher
    than the corresponding value for a mask.
              It is interesting to compare the efficacy for different facial areas. Figure 8 presents the
    blocking efficacy evaluated for specific areas. For cases without vertical separation, the efficacy
    depends on the location: For the center of the face, the forehead, the nose and the chin, it is close
    to 100%, while at the cheeks and neck, which are closer to the visor’s margins, the efficacy falls
    to 40-50%.
              An added vertical distance of 30 cm above and below results in an increase in the relative
    penetration of droplets, regardless of the facial area. The droplets penetrate through the shield
    openings, and affect all parts of the face, not only those close to the openings.
              For side orientation tests in which the left cheek faces the source (three groups of bars
    furthest to the right), a decrease in all efficacy values is observed. The enhanced blocking provided
    by the extended shield (FS5) is mostly manifested in the efficacies related to the left cheek (yellow
    bars), with an improvement from ~10% to ~85%.
    Protection provided to persons surrounding an infected wearer
              The potential of a shield worn by an infected individual to prevent transmittance was tested
    by placing the shield on the diffuser in the location and orientation to simulate usage by an infected
    person. The manikin head was again positioned 60 cm away, facing the source. Water sensitive
    papers were taped on different manikin facial areas and APS measurements were taken. For
    comparison the same was repeated with a surgical mask. In both cases, 15 cough events were
    simulated sequentially, 30 seconds apart. After the series of coughs, the papers were analyzed. For

    both the shield and the mask cases, no indication of droplets could be found on the papers. Also,
    no signal higher than the background values could be detected by the APS instrument. This implies
    that for the configuration described, a shield worn by an infected individual seems to block the
    infected spray emitted in an expiratory event as effectively as a surgical mask.
    DISCUSSION
              Motivated by the potential of mass-use of face shields in place of surgical masks to control
    the spread of COVID-19, various shields were tested. A carefully calibrated airbrush diffuser was
    used to simulate human coughs. A manikin head connected to a breathing simulator was used to
    examine different protective equipment, including a surgical mask, a N95 respirator, as well as
    different kinds of face shields. Different configurations and orientations were also tested. The
    penetrating air was monitored with an APS instrument for fine particles, and relative infiltration
    was assessed by analyzing water-sensitive papers that were taped on the face and on the PPE
              For frontal exposure, the droplet blocking efficacy of different shields was comparable to
    that of a surgical mask. Fine particles were blocked even more efficiently by a shield than by a
    mask. However, the protection provided by a shield was found to depend on the exposure
    orientation and on the configuration. When vertical distance between the source and the manikin
    head was introduced, or alternatively, when the side of the manikin head is directed towards the
    source, the performance, relative to a mask, is degraded. Tests with an extended visor have shown
    to greatly improve the protection provided by the shield for side orientations. This result implies
    that extending shields toward covering a wider part of the face, especially the neck and the cheeks,

    may improve their efficacy. This is consistent with the recommendations of the Centers for
    Diseases Control and Prevention (Workplace Safety & Health Topics, 2015).
              Protection provided to the persons surrounding the wearer was tested placing a shield and
    a mask on the source of the spray, and monitoring the manikin face for droplets and particles. After
    multiple consecutive simulated cough events, no droplets could be found on the water sensitive
    papers. Also, no concentration higher than the background concentration could be detected.
              It is reasonable to assume that the efficient blocking exhibited by the face shield for fine
    particles is a consequence of a combination of the visor’s impermeability together with the flow
    and mixing patterns formed by the interaction of the jet and the shield. When the jet impacts the
    shield, it is deflected to the sides, away from the airways. At the visor’s margins, the abrupt change
    in the boundary layer induces turbulent mixing which lowers the concentration. Ambient air flow
    carries the contaminated air further away, and the fraction of eventually infiltrating particles is
    low.
              A few comments regarding the limitations of the study and the interpretation of the results
    should be made:
              First, the distribution of pathogens among different droplet size populations is yet unknown
    for the novel coronavirus, as is the minimal infective dose. Therefore, these factors are not taken
    into account in our analysis. The relation between blocking efficacy and transmittance probability
    is an important issue not addressed in this study.
              Second, during their flight, droplets evaporate, and their diameter is reduced. This process
    is affected by the flow velocity, temperature, and relative humidity in the close proximity of the

    droplet, which can deviate from environmental background values due to the local impact of the
    droplet cloud itself (Bourouiba. 2020). Studying this effect requires careful monitoring and control
    on the environmental parameters along the droplets path. This, too, was not in the scope of the
    current work.
              Another important comment regards the protection a face shield, or a surgical mask against
    air-suspended, fine aerosol. A plastic visor is not a filter, and fine contaminated particulate matter,
    carried with the airflow, can easily go around the face shield. Likewise, a surgical mask, though
    made of permeable material that can, by itself, act as a filter, is not designed to block fine aerosol
    from being inhaled. A recent study (Konda, et al., 2020) reports that even a minor gap, allowing
    the flow to bypass the filter, drastically decreases the filtering performance. This is consistent with
    the low Simulated Workplace Protection Factor (SWPF) of surgical masks compared to N95
    respirators (Lawrence, et al., 2006). This implies that practically, both because of inherent fitting
    problems and because many users do not wear them in an optimal way, surgical masks hardly
    provide any protection against a fine aerosol. The advantage of face shields found in the current
    study is limited to the case of direct exposure to an expiratory event (in our case, a cough), where
    directional flow is involved in the process. For these events, the ability of a face shield to deflect
    the flow and to create mixing is the origin of advantageous performance over surgical masks.
              In this respect, it is also important to emphasize that N95 respirators that are designed to
    fit the face and filter particulate matter, provide much better protection against suspended aerosol
    than both surgical masks and face shields.

    CONCLUSIONS
              The applied generic setup and methodology can be used to test infiltration of particulate
    matter for different PPE in various configurations and scenarios. Overall, our results imply that a
    jet of particles formed by an expiratory event directed towards a shield is efficiently blocked, which
    results in protection comparable to that attained by a surgical mask, and even higher for fine
    particles. Ensuring optimal performance may involve design of shields with a wider visor. Also, a
    shield worn by an infected person seems to be at least as effective as a mask in preventing
    transmittance to nearby, unprotected individuals.

    Figure 4. Example of typical APS number concentration signal. A few seconds after a cough is
    generated, the concentration sharply rises. Then, during the following minute it returns to the
    background values, around 2-3 particles cm-3.

    Figure 5. APS measurements statistics of inhaled particles number concentration, see Equation (2).
    The horizontal axis specifies the aerodynamic particle diameter (A- fine particles, B- large
    particles). Repetitions are grouped into four different cases as indicated by the different colors.
    The standard deviation among different repetitions in each group is indicated by error bars.

    Figure 6. Peak number concentration statistics, as measured by the APS instrument. Each dot
    represents the peak concentration of one repetition. Repetitions are divided into frontal and side
    exposures; in the former the groups are in an un-protected scenario (32 repetitions), plastic shield
    (20 repetitions), surgical mask (21 repetitions), and a N95 respirator (11 repetitions), and in the
    latter, surgical mask, regular shield (FS4), and an extended shield (FS5), with 5 repetitions each.
    The horizontal red line marks the median, the blue square indicates the second and third quantiles,
    and the horizontal black lines show the first and ninth decile.

    Figure 7. The blocking efficacy (equation 1) of different face shields (FS) and a mask, for different
    configurations. The labels indicate the specific configuration: ‘front’-frontal exposure,
    ‘up’(‘down’)- frontal configuration where the airbrush is moved 30 cm upward (downward).
    ‘side’- the manikin head faces perpendicular to the jet direction, with no vertical separation.
