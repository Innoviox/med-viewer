28     The Islamic Republic of Iran reported its first COVID-19 cases by 19th February 2020,
29     since then it has become one of the most affected countries, with more than 73,000 cases
30     and 4,585 deaths to this date. Spatial modeling could be used to approach an
31     understanding of structural and sociodemographic factors that have impacted COVID-19
32     spread at a province-level in Iran. Therefore, in the present paper, we developed a spatial
33     statistical approach to describe how COVID-19 cases are spatially distributed and to
34     identify significant spatial clusters of cases and how socioeconomic and climatic features
35     of Iranian provinces might predict the number of cases. The analyses are applied to
36     cumulative cases of the disease from February 19th to March 18th. They correspond to
37     obtaining maps associated with quartiles for rates of COVID-19 cases smoothed through a
38     Bayesian technique and relative risks, the calculation of global (Moran’s I) and local
39     indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA), both univariate and bivariate, to derive
40     significant clustering, and the fit of a multivariate spatial lag model considering a set of
41     variables potentially affecting the presence of the disease. We identified a cluster of
42     provinces with significantly higher rates of COVID-19 cases around Tehran (p-value<
43     0.05), indicating that the COVID-19 spread within Iran was spatially correlated. Urbanized,
44     highly connected provinces with older population structures and higher average
45     temperatures were the most susceptible to present a higher number of COVID-19 cases
46     (p-value < 0.05). Interestingly, literacy is a factor that is associated with a decrease in the
47     number of cases (p-value < 0.05), which might be directly related to health literacy and
48     compliance with public health measures. These features indicate that social distancing,
49     protecting older adults, and vulnerable populations, as well as promoting health literacy,
50     might be useful to reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread in Iran. One limitation of our analysis is that
51     the most updated information we found concerning socioeconomic and climatic features is

52     not for 2020, or even for a same year, so that the obtained associations should be
53     interpreted with caution. Our approach could be applied to model COVID-19 outbreaks in
54     other countries with similar characteristics or in case of an upturn in COVID-19 within Iran.

59     Author Summary
60     Iran was among the first countries reporting a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19
61     cases. Spatial epidemiology is useful to study the spatial distribution of a disease and to
62     identify factors associated with the number of cases of such disease. By applying these
63     methods, we aimed to identify whether there are clusters of regions in Iran with high or low
64     number of COVID-19 cases and the association of different factors with these numbers,
65     considering spatial relationships and maps representing these associations. Interestingly,
66     we found regions of high number of cases and that more COVID-19 cases were present in
67     provinces with more urbanization, aging population, number of physicians, efficient
68     communications, and greater average temperatures, whereas less COVID-19 cases were
69     present in provinces with more literacy. This study allowed us to understand the spatial
70     behavior of the disease and the importance of having adequate health policies, literacy
71     campaigns, and disseminating health information to the population.

74     INTRODUCTION
75     On 11th March 2020, the General Director of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr.
76     Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, declared the new infectious respiratory disease COVID-
77     19, caused by the infection of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as a pandemic, due to the
78     rate of growth of new cases, the number of affected people, and the number of deaths (1).
79     As of the time of this writing (April 15th, 2020), the number of infected cases world-wide
80     corresponded to more than 1 million, being the most affected countries: Italy (16,523
81     deaths), Spain (13,341 deaths), USA (10,792 deaths), France (8,911 deaths), United
82     Kingdom (5,373 deaths), and Iran (3,739 deaths)(2,3).
83      Iran was among the first countries outside of China to report a rapid increase in the
84     number of COVID-19 cases and associated deaths; its first confirmed cases were reported
85     on 19th February 2020 in the province of Qom imported from Wuhan, China(4).
86     Nevertheless, some reports suggest that the outbreak may have happened two or six
87     weeks before the government official announcement (5). Iran had one of the highest
88     COVID-19 mortality rates early in the pandemic, and its rate of spread has been amongst
89     the highest. However, as with other countries, it may be a sub-estimation of cases, and
90     there may be other cases not officially reported (6).
91     The large count of COVID-19 cases and mortality in Iran are multifactorial. Iran’s response
92     to the epidemic has been highly affected by several imposed economic sanctions and
93     armed conflicts within the last 20 years. Moreover, its difficult economic situation due to a
94     recession, having inflation rates that are among the highest in the region, has taken a toll
95     on its public health system (7,8). Although there are approximately 184,000 hospitals and
96     primary health-care staff, limitations in the availability of COVID-19 testing kits, protective
97     equipment, and ventilators are quite important. On the other hand, over the last years, Iran
98     has slowed the rate of mortality associated with infectious and maternal diseases. It is
99     currently undergoing an epidemiological transition where infectious diseases interact with

100     chronic conditions (2). In this sense, Iran may represent other similar developing world
101     countries with poor health systems and an increased prevalence of chronic diseases.
102     Spatial statistics have emerged as a useful tool for the analysis of spatial epidemiology,
103     concerning mapping and statistical analyses of spatial and spatial-temporal incidences of
104     different pathogens. The aim of this paper is to perform spatial analyses which allow us to
105     better understand the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran, not only in terms of the strength of its
106     presence and socioeconomic and structural factors which facilitate the disease spread
107     within Iranian provinces, but also in terms of how the disease is spatially distributed and
108     which variables are spatially related with it considering the spatial effect to obtain adequate
109     inferences. Given the role of climate and socio-economic factors in determining the
110     distribution of cases and its impact world-wide, we also aimed to incorporate said factors
111     as predictors of SARS-CoV-2 spread (9,10).This could aid to understand the burden of
112     COVID-19, its distribution in the country, and its implication on public health within Iran and
113     similar countries (11) and could contribute to public health measures by providing insight
114     to inform the implementation of interventions or to understand socio-demographic factors
115     associated with the SARS-CoV-2 spread and COVID-19 heterogeneity as it has been
116     applied to previous infectious diseases (12–16).
117     MATERIAL AND METHODS
118     Data sources
119     We obtained province-specific data considering 31 provinces or polygons in Iran (Table 1).
120     From the Statistical Centre of Iran (17), we extracted information concerning: 1) people
121     settled in urban areas in 2016 (%), calculated from the population and household of Iran
122     by province and sub-province information of the census, 2) people aged ≥60 years in 2016
123     calculated from the population disaggregated by age groups, sex, and province
124     information of the census, 3) population density (people per ݇݉ଶ ) in 2016, 4) literacy rate
125     of population aged ≥6 years in 2016, obtained from the document of selected results from

126     the 2016 census, 5) the Consumer Price Index percent changes on March 2020 for the
127     national households in contrast to the corresponding month of the previous year (point-to-
128     point inflation), and 6) the average temperature (°C) of provincial capitals and 7) annual
129     precipitation levels (mm) in 2015, both part of the climate and environment information.
130     From the Iran data portal (18), we obtained, from the health section: 1) the number of
131     physicians employed by the ministry of health and medical education in 2006 and 2) the
132     number of beds in operating medical establishments in 2006 and from the government
133     finance section: 3) the province contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) in 2004. We
134     used a Transportation Efficiency Index (TEI)(19), constructed through Data Evelopment
135     Analysis, being an indicator of the extent in which each province efficiently utilize their
136     transportation infrastructure. The TEI has values between zero and one, values near to
137     one indicate provinces better communicated, but we standardized it (values of each
138     province minus its mean divided by the associated standard deviation) to allow
139     interpretations in a better scale in terms of how the increase in a certain number of
140     standard deviations of the TEI is associated with the number of COVID-19 cases. The
141     cumulative number of cases with confirmed COVID-19 by Province from February 19th to
142     March 18th, 2020, was also obtained (20). It is important to notice that, in order to obtain
143     more accurate rates of cases with COVID-19, population size in 2020 by province was
144     derived by using mathematical projection methods (arithmetic, geometric, exponential, and
145     logistic or saturation methods) using information contained in the population and housing
146     censuses from 2006, 2011, and 2016. Since all methods provided similar results, we show
147     here only those associated with the arithmetic method. Shapefiles were obtained from the
148     Stanford            Libraries          Earthworks:           https://earthworks.stanford.edu/catalog/stanford-
149     dv126wm3595, in which files are freely available for academic use and other non-
150     commercial use (21).
151     COVID-19 rate estimation by Iranian provinces

152     We obtained quantile maps associated with raw rates of COVID-19 cases, as well as
153     smoothed case rates by province using an empirical Bayes estimator, which is a biased
154     estimator that improves variance instability proper of rates estimated in small-sized spatial
155     units (22) (i.e. provinces with a larger population size have lower variance than provinces
156     with a smaller population size). Since raw and smoothed rates were surprisingly similar,
157     only results of smoothed rates are reported. We also obtained maps concerning excess or
158     relative risk, serving as a comparison of the observed number of cases by the province to
159     a national standard. For the variable concerning the number of people aged ≥60 years by
160     province, raw, and smoothed rates were obtained using empirical Bayes, and the latter
161     were used in all analyses.
162     Spatial weight estimation and spatial autocorrelation
163     Since all spatial analyses require spatial weights, we obtained queen contiguity weights
164     (23). Provinces were considered as neighbors when they share at least a point or vertex in
165     common, obtaining a squared matrix of dimension 31 (31x31 matrix) with all entries equal
166     to zero or one, the latter value indicating that two provinces are neighbors. From these
167     neighbors, weights are calculated by integrating a matrix in a row-standardized form, i.e.,
168     equal weights for each neighbor and summing one for each row. Moran's I statistic was
169     obtained as an indicator of global spatial autocorrelation (24), and its significance was
170     assessed through a random permutation inference technique based on randomly
171     permuting the observed values over the spatial units (25). Local indicators of spatial
172     autocorrelation (LISA) were obtained, being these a decomposition of Moran’s I used to
173     identify the contribution of each province in the statistic (26). LISA was used to derive
174     significant spatial clustering through four cluster types: High-High, Low-Low, High-Low,
175     and Low-High. For instance, the High-High cluster indicates provinces with high values of
176     a variable that are significantly surrounded by regions with similarly high values.
177     Analogous to Moran's I and LISA, estimates can be calculated to identify the spatial

178     correlation between two variables and to identify bivariate clustering (27). For instance, to
179     identify provinces with high values in a first variable surrounded by provinces with high
180     values for a second variable (cluster High-High). Bivariate clustering and quartile maps
181     were obtained for each of the significant variables in a linear spatial model, to have a
182     better understanding of the individual spatial effect of each of these variables over the
183     smoothed rates associated with the disease.
184     Spatial multivariate linear models
185     Spatial multivariate linear models were fitted to identify variables that significantly impact
186                the
187     number of log-transformed COVID-19 cases (28). This response variable was chosen
188                since
189     the corresponding model better satisfies all statistical assumptions, the other variables
190     introduced in the Data section were simultaneously introduced as explanatory, first
191     removing from the model all variables generating multicollinearity. Ordinary Least Squares
192     (OLS) estimation was used to identify whether a linear spatial model was necessary by
193     using a Lagrange Multiplier (LM) and a robust LM statistics to compare the non-spatial
194     model with spatial models (29). Two kinds of spatial models were compared; the spatial-
195     lag model considers the spatially lagged response as an additional explanatory variable,
196     whereas the spatial-error model considers that the error is a linear function of a spatially
197     lagged error plus another error term. Another model was obtained by performing a
198     backward selection process, considering the elimination of the most non-significant
199     variable in each step and the minimization of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). This
200     process allowed us to identify whether the associations obtained through this model were
201     similar as those obtained through the model including all variables. For significant
202     variables in the linear spatial models, interpretations in the original scale (i.e., as counts)
203     were derived and we performed bivariate LISA significant clustering between each of

204     these significant variables and the rate of cases with COVID-19, as explained above. All
205     statistical analyses were conducted using GeoDa version 1.14.0. A two-tailed p-
206     value<0.05 was considered as the significance threshold.
207     RESULTS
208     Rates description and spatial autocorrelation of COVID-19 case rates between provinces
209     Maps for quartiles corresponding to the smoothed rates and excess risk of COVID-19
210     cases are shown in Figure 1. We observed that the highest rates of COVID-19 and excess
211     risk values were located in the Northern region of Iran corresponding to the provinces of
212     Qom, Marzaki, Mazandaran, and Semnan. There were also high rates associated with the
213     provinces of Alborz, Gilan, Qazvin, and Yazd (last quartile). We observed significant
214     spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I=0.426, p=0.002), indicating that COVID-19 rates
215     between provinces are significantly spatially related. From the heat and significance maps
216     corresponding to significant clusters using an empirical Bayes spatial technique, we
217     delimited a High-High cluster in red, indicating a northern zone around Tehran and Alborz
218     with significant high COVID-19 rates surrounded by areas with similarly high rates.
219     Conversely, we delimited a Low-Low cluster in blue indicating southern provinces with
220     small rates surrounded by areas with similarly lower rates, which includes the provinces of
221     Bushehr, Homozgan, Sistan, and Baluschestan. Interestingly, Golestan showed in light
222     purple, has significantly lower COVID-19 rates despite being surrounded by a cluster of
223     provinces with higher rates (Figure 2).
224     Selection of multivariate linear spatial model for COVID-19 spread
225     Since the variable hospital beds is strongly associated with variables GDP and number of
226     physicians (Kendall correlation coefficients above 0.55), we eliminated it from all models to
227     avoid multicollinearity (Supplementary material). We confirmed that a spatial model was
228     necessary since the error term from the OLS fitting showed significant spatial
229     autocorrelation (Moran’s I= 0.134, p-value=0.025). Additionally, the LM and Robust LM

230     statistics indicated that a spatial lag model was required since the spatial parameter (ߩ)
231     associated with the spatially lagged response was significant (LM=10.669, p-value=0.001;
232     Robust LM=13.557, p-value < 0.001), which did not occur with the spatial error model
233     since the corresponding spatial parameter was not consistently significant (LM=1.256, p-
234     value=0.262; Robust LM=4.144, p-value=0.042). Thus, only the spatial lag model was
235     fitted obtaining a significant spatial parameter (ߩ = 0.723, p-value<0.001), which indicated
236     that the rate of an area in the linear model is affected by COVID-19 rates in neighboring
237     areas (R2=0.877, ߪ ଶ =0.146). Normality and homoscedasticity assumptions were
238     reasonably satisfied.
239     Predictors of COVID-19 spatial spread in Iranian provinces
240     The significant variables associated with the model obtained through the selection scheme
241     were the same as those associated with the model including all variables. This simplified
242     model excluded population density, Consumer Price Index, and annual precipitation. The
243     estimated coefficients were similar for both models; however, we analyzed the estimations
244     associated with the model including all variables to consider effects controlled for these
245     three variables. Hence, the variables that significantly impact the log-transformed number
246     of COVID-19 cases include: the percentage of people settled in urban areas (p-value =
247     0.019), smoothed rate of people aged ≥60 years (p-value < 0.001), literacy rate (p-value =
248     0.006), average temperature (p-value < 0.001), number of physicians employed (p-value <

250     1% increase in the population aged ≥60 years has a percentage increase of 29.29%
251     (95%CI 26.55 – 32.10%) and 46.65% (95%CI 26.54% -69.95%), respectively, on the

253     increase of 1 physician, or an increase of one deviation over the standardized TEI also
254     have a percentage increase of 11.98% (95%CI 5.54-18.80%), 0.08% (95%CI 0.06 -

258     Spatial lag predictors and province clusters
259     Quartile maps for each of the significant variables in the spatial lag model are shown in
260     Figure 3. Finally, concerning bivariate LISA significant clustering, we observed a positive
261     spatial relationship (Moran’s I=0.341, p-value=0.002) between urban population and
262     COVID-19 rates; provinces with high urban rates surrounded by areas with high COVID-19
263     rates are the same as the ones in the High-High cluster for COVID-19, except for
264     Mazandaran, and similarly for the Low-Low cluster, except for Bushehr. There is also a
265     positive spatial relationship (Moran’s I=0.279, p-value=0.002) between the population aged
266     ≥60 and COVID-19 rates. Both High-High and Low-Low clusters include similar provinces
267     as the ones in the clusters for COVID-19, except for Qom and Alborz, which have
268     significantly lower rates of people aged ≥60 years but are spatially surrounded by areas
269     with high disease rates. Concerning literacy rates, we also identified a positive spatial
270     relationship between literacy and disease rates (Moran’s I=0.362, p-value=0.005). The
271     associated High-High cluster and that obtained for COVID-19 rates are formed by the
272     same provinces, whereas in the south, Hormozgan and Bushehr have high literacy rates
273     but are surrounded by areas with low disease rates.
274     Concerning average temperature levels, the global spatial autocorrelation is negative
275     (Moran’s I=-0.107, p-value=0.103). The High-High clusters for temperature and COVID-19
276     rates are similar, except for Marzaki and Alborz, where there is significantly lower
277     temperature surrounded by areas with high COVID-19 rates. In the south, there is a
278     significantly high temperature with spatially lower disease rates.
279     There is a positive spatial relationship (Moran’s I=0.302, p-value=0.003) between the
280     number of physicians and the COVID-19 rate. There is a High-High cluster in the north
281     with a High-Low zone between formed by Marzaki, Qom, and Semnan, with a significantly

282     lower number of physicians; however, they are spatially surrounded by areas with higher
283     disease rates. Concerning the TEI, the spatial correlation is close to zero (Moran’s I = -
284     0.096, p-value=0.112), indicating a particular random global spatial relationship between
285     TEI and the disease rate. The High-High cluster is the same as the High-High cluster for
286     the disease, except for Mazandaran and Alborz, which have significantly low TEI but are
287     surrounded by areas with high disease rates. In the south, two provinces, which formed a
288     Low-Low cluster for COVID-19 cases, are now areas with high TEI spatially associated
289     with areas with low disease rates.
290     DISCUSSION
291     Here, we demonstrate that the rates of COVID-19 cases within Iranian provinces are
292     spatially correlated. This could be due to the origin of the outbreak, which started on the
293     north of Iran, and can be seen through an important province cluster with the highest
294     number of COVID-19 cases that we found around Tehran and Qom.                                                    Several
295     mathematical models have been used to model the COVID-19 outbreak, mostly focused
296     on forecasting the number of cases and assessing the capacity of country-level healthcare
297     systems to manage disease burden (30–32). In the present report, we demonstrate that
298     the spatial relationship and socio-demographic factors associated with the provinces must
299     be considered to model the disease adequately, and this report also highlights structural
300     factors that may lead to inequities in COVID-19 spread. Of relevance, we highlight the role
301     of social determinants of health in sustaining SARS-CoV-2 transmission and provide
302     additional evidence that human mobility or province interconnectedness might be
303     associated in favoring disease spread (33).
304     Importantly, our approach demonstrates that urbanization, aging population, education,
305     average temperatures, number of physicians, and inter-province communications are
306     associated with the case numbers amongst Iranian provinces. The obtained results do not
307     consider the spatial effect, which is accumulated since the spatially lagged response is

308     part of the explanatory variables, and they consider fixed values for all variables except the
309     one being interpreted. Overall, these variables spatially correlate with the COVID-19
310     province clustering indicating a consistent association with the observed variables. The
311     greatest increase in the number of COVID-19 cases is associated with people aged ≥60
312     years, urban population, and how well the provinces are communicated, with age having
313     one of the most important associations, an increase of 1% in the corresponding rate
314     implies a percentage increase of 46.65% over the number of cases. Of relevance,
315     mortality attributable to COVID-19 complications is higher in this age group, and age
316     increases the likelihood of developing the symptomatic disease and increased disease
317     severity (34,35).              Nevertheless, the association with older age could have different
318     meanings depending on the number of comorbidities, with some reports labeling COVID-
319     19 as an age-related disease (36). Our data demonstrate that the spatial spread of
320     COVID-19 has a relationship with population aging structures, a concept that must be
321     explored in this setting to obtain population-specific estimates and lethality and which
322     could represent a significant structural inequality related to COVID-19 burden (37).
323     Urbanization rates also are associated with a percentage increase over the number of
324     COVID-19             cases;          we    observed         a    similar     association         regarding      province
325     interconnectedness, which goes in line with recent information on human mobility and its
326     effect in decreasing disease spread through social distancing (33). Urbanization, as a
327     demographic phenomenon, leads to increased interconnectedness and human mobility as
328     well as increased population density; these two factors facilitate disease spread. Emerging
329     zoonotic diseases similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been linked to major structural factors that
330     have been reported in other studies, including population growth, climate change,
331     urbanization, and pollution (38,39). Thus, communication and the degree of urbanity, and
332     what this implies in terms of pollution, overcrowding, among other factors, seem to be
333     relevant to determine the number of COVID-19 cases and should imply geographical

334     targets for public health interventions to monitor disease spread and disease containment
335     (40).
336     The only effect associated with a decrease in the number of COVID19 cases in our study
337     was attributed to literacy, which might reflect several factors that ultimately influence
338     disease spread. Data from several countries, including Iran, identified that higher health
339     literacy was associated with a lower number of COVID-19 cases, probably reflecting
340     attitudes towards public health measures including social distancing, early disease
341     detection, and hand hygiene (41,42). Interestingly, this poses a potential public health
342     intervention given that individuals with reduced health literacy, not only might have higher
343     rates of COVID-19, but also increased likelihood for depression and impaired quality of life
344     in suspected cases. Literacy’s protective effect on disease spread also indicates a strong
345     influence on social inequity and vulnerability as risk factors for COVID-19 spread,
346     particularly on the influence of health equity, which will likely define the long-term impact of
347     COVID-19 in many developing countries (43).
348     Concerning average temperature levels, we were able to obtain information associated
349     only with the capitals and not the provinces, being a limitation of the analyzed information,
350     obtaining some inconclusive results. On one hand, the global spatial autocorrelation was
351     negative, though not statistically significant, indicating that global areas with higher
352     temperatures are spatially related to areas with lower disease rates. On the other hand, on
353     the spatial linear model, we derived that more temperature is associated with more cases.
354     However; the former result does not contradict the latter since the direct effect in each
355     province of a variable over the response is different from the spatial relationship between
356     two variables. The latter considers one of the variables as spatially lagged (COVID-19),
357     and thus the direct effect between variables in the same province is not included. In fact,
358     this problem occurs in all the bivariate analysis, so care should be taken in all the
359     interpretations. Notably, our results are consistent with previous analyses which have

360     analyzed the impact of climate on SARS-CoV-2 stability and spread (44). However, these
361     results should be further studied considering the climate data limitations, that we obtained
362     mixed results, and that some studies suggest there is no evidence that spread rates of the
363     disease decline with higher temperatures (45).
364     Our study had some strengths and limitations. We approached COVID-19 using spatial
365     analysis, which allowed us to identify province-level factors that are associated with the
366     disease spread and which may be shared by other countries with similar socioeconomic or
367     geographic structures by potentially identifying targets for country-wide public health
368     interventions. This approach considers disease spread beyond individual-specific factors
369     and could also be used to monitor areas of a potentially high number of undiagnosed
370     cases that could facilitate disease spread and the surge of delayed waves of COVID-19
371     after initial mitigation (46,47). Methodologically, all our analyses consider the spatial nature
372     of the data. We identified significant spatial clustering and in terms of the spatial
373     multivariate linear model, by including a spatial effect, we consider that the number of
374     cases in an area is affected by those in neighboring areas. In this way, a lack of
375     independency between spatial units is considered, being independence assumed in a
376     usual linear model, thus obtaining more precise estimations. Of course, other statistical
377     methods are available for this task, as generalized linear mixed models or geographically
378     weighted regression; however, they do not use spatial weights, making our results more
379     comparable with the Moran’s I or spatial clustering, which are based on such weights. A
380     limitation of our approach is that most of the variables used to explain COVID-19 disease
381     rates were taken from previous years and not updates, given the unavailability of recent
382     estimates. Furthermore, smoothed COVID-19 rates were calculated using a projection of
383     the population in 2020 since the most recent census corresponds to 2016, thus rates could
384     have slightly different values. In this sense, the explanatory variables were not projected
385     since information of previous years was not always available; however, precise projections

386     for each variable were out of the scope of this work; and, it is also possible that some
387     variables have a time lagged effect over the response. However; the time lagged effect we
388     included was unintentional and dependent on the information available and not
389     considering a lagged time effect as defined by experts; for instance, for GDP we used a
390     time lag of 16 years, when perhaps it should have been of fewer years.                                When obtaining
391     estimates using both projected and population size in 2016, we observed no significant
392     changes in the results, which confirms the robustness of our approach. In fact, with all the
393     mathematical projection methods similar results were obtained. However, the projections
394     by province could be improved by considering a demographic balance equation and
395     probabilistic projection methods as the ones obtained by country by the UN (48). In this
396     sense, we suspect similar results would still be obtained since our projected values by
397     country are similar to those obtained by the UN. We also observed that the smoothed and
398     raw rates of COVID-19 cases were similar, with an absolute difference between them of at
399     most 0.607 (considering rates for every 1000 individuals), this was probably due to Iran not
400     having provinces with extremely small or large population size. Future work could be
401     focused on evaluating spatio-temporal modeling, which could be useful to monitor disease
402     spread and identify additional factors relating not only to transmission rates but also to
403     transmission dynamics. Since COVID-19 is currently challenging health systems all over
404     the world, science-centered public health decisions could benefit from spatial modeling to
405     investigate larger factors targeted for public health interventions.
406     In conclusion, COVID-19 spread within Iranian provinces is spatially correlated. The main
407     factors associated with a high number of cases are older age, high degrees of
408     urbanization, province interconnectedness, higher average temperatures, lower literacy
409     rates, and the number of physicians. Structural determinants for the spread of emerging
410     zoonotic diseases, including SARS-CoV-2, must be understood in order to implement
