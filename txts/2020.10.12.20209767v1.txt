 1   Abstract
 2   Background: Measurement of metabolomics in human stool samples is of great interest for a broad
 3   range of applications in biomedical research including early detection of colorectal neoplasms.
 4   However, due to the complexity of metabolites there is no consensus on how to process samples for
 5   stool metabolomics measurements to obtain a broad coverage of hydrophilic and hydrophobic
 6   substances.
 7   Methods: We used frozen stool samples (50mg) from healthy study participants. Stool samples were
 8   processed after thawing using 8 different processing protocols and different solvents. Metabolites were
 9   measured afterwards using the MxP® Quant 500 kit (Biocrates). The best performing protocol was
10   subsequently applied to compare stool samples of participants with different dietary habits.
11   Results: In this study, we were able to determine up to 340 metabolites of various chemical classes
12   extracted from stool samples of healthy study participants with 8 different protocols. Polar metabolites
13   such as amino acids could be measured with each method while other metabolite classes, particular
14   lipid species, are more dependent on the solvent or combination of solvents used. Only a small number
15   of triglycerides or acylcarnitines were detected in human feces. Extraction efficiency was higher for
16   protocols using isopropanol or those using ethanol or methanol and MTBE including an evaporation
17   and concentration step than for other protocols. We detected significant fecal metabolite differences
18   between vegetarians, semi-vegetarians and non-vegetarians.
19   Conclusion: For the evaluation of metabolites in fecal samples we found protocols using solvents like
20   isopropanol and those using ethanol or methanol and MTBE including an evaporation and
21   concentration step to be superior over others tested in this study.

22   Introduction
23   Measurement of metabolomics in human stool samples is of great interest for a broad range of
24   applications in biomedical research including early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) as a non-
25   invasive alternative to colonoscopy. Metabolomics might be promising for this purpose as metabolites
26   are closely related to the phenotype and depict current metabolic processes happening in an organism.
27   Stool is directly associated with the gut and may reflect changes in metabolism very early through its
28   transit in the gut (1).
29   Fecal mass consists to a great proportion of water and bacteria but also food components or
30   metabolites (2). Fecal samples show great variability in their material content and characteristics,
31   which makes it difficult to standardize the process from collection to processing and analysis including
32   the analytical platform (3). The latter defines also the sensitivity of the analysis and the type of
33   analytes available for analyses. Apart from the afore mentioned differences of stool samples,
34   metabolic changes in stool might be derived directly from the development of cancer or precancerous
35   cells or from a change in the gut microbiota which both result in a distinct metabolic phenotype that
36   might be characteristic for the disease (1). The metabolic profile of CRC or its precursors may help in
37   the understanding of disease development, progression and early detection (4).
38   Some studies have already found fecal metabolomics biomarkers for early detection of CRC but
39   metabolite selection strongly varied (1, 5-7) and as different studies were using different processing
40   methods, no direct comparison is possible. There is no consensus how to process stool samples for
41   metabolomics measurements to get reliable and reproducible results. A review by Deda et al. focused
42   on the existing various stool preparation protocols and found the metabolites to be dependent on the
43   extraction method (8). In this study we used the MxP® Quant 500 Kit (Biocrates Life Sciences AG,
44   Innsbruck, Austria) to determine and quantify a very broad range of metabolite classes in human feces.
45   In total, we used 8 different stool preparation protocols to assess the best coverage for stool metabolite
46   profiles. The protocol yielding the highest multitude of extracted metabolites was used to analyze and
47   compare additional stool samples of healthy study participants with different dietary habits.

48   Subjects and Methods
49   Study design
50   The GEKKO study (Gebt dem Krebs keine Chance – Onkocheck) is an ongoing study in southwest
51   Germany including people participating in screening colonoscopy (Arm A) or with diagnosed primary
52   cancer (Arm B). The study was approved by the ethics committees of the Medical Faculty Heidelberg
53   and of the physicians’ boards of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland Palatinate. The GEKKO study
54   Arm A was designed to evaluate novel early detection markers of CRC. People undergoing a
55   screening colonoscopy at a gastroenterology practice in or around Heidelberg, Germany, who are over
56   the age of 30 years, with no history of CRC, no inflammatory bowel disease, no colonoscopy within
57   the last 5 years and speaking and understanding the German language are invited to participate.
58   After written informed consent was received, participants are asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding
59   lifestyle and demographic data and to provide blood, stool, saliva and urine samples for research
60   purposes prior to colonoscopy. Biosamples are processed and then stored at -80°C until needed.
61   Colonoscopy reports are provided from the physicians to the study center. Participants are grouped
62   according to their most advanced finding at colonoscopy. From the individuals with no polyps or any
63   findings at colonoscopy, those with incomplete colonoscopy (Coecum not reached) or poor bowel
64   preparation were excluded. For this analysis, 3 participants of the GEKKO study Arm A were selected
65   between the age of 50 and 79 years with no polyps or any findings at colonoscopy to test 8 different
66   stool preparation protocols and to define the best analytical outcome.
67   In a further step, stool samples from additional healthy GEKKO participants (n = 18) of approximately
68   the same age (50 – 65 years) with different dietary habits (vegetarians, semi-vegetarians, and non-
69   vegetarians) were processed with the protocol that performed best with respect to numbers of detected
70   metabolites and sample handling, and results were compared between groups. Information on dietary
71   habits of the study participants was extracted from the questionnaire. Vegetarians were defined as
72   never eating meat, processed meat and poultry. Semi-vegetarians were defined as eating meat,
73   processed meat and poultry less than once a week. Other participants reporting to consume either meat
74   or processed meat or poultry more often were categorized as non-vegetarians (9).

 75   Sample collection and handling
 76   Native stool samples were collected by the participants at home from a normal bowel movement prior
 77   to bowel preparation for colonoscopy with standard stool collection tubes provided with a small spoon
 78   for collecting the stool. The stool samples were then directly frozen by the participants at -20°C at
 79   home. The participants were asked to document date and time of sampling and the storage
 80   temperature. The stool samples were taken by the participant in a freeze-cool transport container and
 81   in an isolated envelope to the gastroenterologists’ practices, directly frozen again at -20°C and within
 82   the week of receipt delivered by a transport service on dry ice to the GEKKO study laboratory at the
 83   National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) in Heidelberg where they were immediately frozen
 84   at -80°C.
 85   Processing of the samples
 86   For this analysis, we used stool samples from 3 individuals of the GEKKO study testing 8 different
 87   stool processing protocols each in triplicate which results in a total of 72 measurements. Every
 88   protocol was performed with a frozen biomass of 50mg wet stool weight. Used protocols were adapted
 89   in part from previously published work (protocol 1 (10), protocol 3 (11) and protocol 7 (12)) and from
 90   the current recommended SOP provided from Biocrates (protocol 5 (13)). Details of the protocols are
 91   shown in Table 1. In brief, feces was cut and weighed in frozen state and kept frozen until processing.
 92   The samples were thawed and prepared according to the specific protocol and frozen again at -80°C
 93   until further processing via MxP® Quant 500 Kit (Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck, Austria).
 94   Liquid sample extracts were processed according to the vendor’s instructions for human plasma
 95   samples. Samples dried after extraction had to be resolved before measurement (for protocol 6 and 7).
 96   Therefore, 50µl of 100% isopropanol were added into the vial and the mixture was vortexed for 3 min
 97   at room temperature. Additionally, 50µl of 30% isopropanol were added and again vortexed for 3min
 98   at room temperature. Short centrifugation (5sec) separated the solid substances from the liquid phase
 99   which was further used for analysis.
100   For metabolite measurements, a QTRAP6500+ (Sciex, Germany) MS/MS connected to an UPLC I-
101   class Plus (Waters, Germany) chromatography system was used. Conditions for LC separation and

102   FIA analyses as well as individual MRM parameters for each metabolite and respective internal
103   standards were provided by the vendor of the kit (Biocrates). The software MetIDQ (version Oxygen;
104   Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck, Austria) was used for processing of the data.
105   In total, 630 metabolites can be measured via this kit. The limit of detection (LOD) for each
106   compound is defined as three times the background noise. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) is
107   at least ten times the background noise. At LLOQ measured metabolite concentrations can be
108   considered as reliable. Data are normalized with a tissue factor for quantification under the following
109   assumption: 1mg tissue equals 1µl tissue or stool. Concentrations are given in pmol of the metabolite
110   /mg stool mass.
111   The following metabolites are measurable using the aforementioned kit: 1 alkaloid (trigonelline), 1
112   amine oxide (trimethylamine N-oxide), 20 amino acids, 30 other amino acid related metabolites, 14
113   bile acids, 9 biogenic amines, sugars (hexoses including glucose), 7 carboxylic acids, 1 cresol (p-
114   cresol sulfate), 12 fatty acids, 4 hormone and related metabolites, 4 indoles and derivatives, 2
115   nucleobases and related molecules, 1 metabolite from the group of vitamins and cofactors, 40
116   acylcarnitines, 14 lysophosphatidylcholines, 76 phosphatidylcholines, 15 sphingomyelins, 28
117   ceramides, 8 dihydroceramides, 19 hexosylceramides, 9 dihexosylceramides, 6 trihexosylceramides,
118   22 cholesteryl esters, 44 diglycerides, and 242 triglycerides. All the related isobaric and isomeric lipid
119   species can be measured but cannot be distinguished by this method.
120   Statistical analyses
121   We measured 630 metabolites and calculated a range of sums and ratios of metabolites indicating
122   metabolic pathways and syntheses. Those compounds with the mean below LOD were excluded and
123   described as not measured. Metabolism indicators were calculated with the MetIDQ software and
124   those with more than half of the values below LOD were marked as below LOD in the following. We
125   calculated means and standard deviations and assessed the number of metabolites and their respective
126   classes for each processing method.

132   Results
133   We measured metabolites with the MxP® Quant 500 kit using 8 different protocols for stool
134   processing from 3 healthy participants of the GEKKO study (free of neoplasms). We were able to
135   extract metabolites with each protocol but the number of detectable metabolites varied (Table 2).
136   Most metabolites were extracted (a) using isopropanol (protocol 2) and (b) when we dried the liquid
137   extracts after extraction and reconstituted the samples in a smaller volume to increase metabolite
138   concentrations (protocols 6 and 7).
139   The solvents differ in their polarity and therefore in their extraction efficacy to solve metabolites of the
140   different chemical classes studied. With the MxP® Quant 500 kit, 630 metabolites can be determined
141   of 14 classes of small molecules and 12 lipid classes (Supplementary Table 1). In addition, a range
142   of sum and ratios that describe certain pathways and syntheses in the organism is calculated via the
143   MetIDQ software from the obtained data (Supplementary Table 2). Amino acids and amino acid
144   related products were detected with concentrations above limit of detection in the analyzed stool
145   samples by all evaluated extraction protocols. Concentrations for amine oxides or carbohydrates and
146   related products were always below the LOD. Major differences were observed for triglycerides as
147   none of the compounds were above the LOD using PBS for preparation whereas more than 50 could
148   be measured using isopropanol or ethanol or methanol in combination with concentrating the liquid
149   extract.
150   Protocol 6 was favorable in terms of sample handling and measured numbers of metabolites.
151   Therefore, we further measured 18 stool samples according to this protocol from participants with
152   different dietary habits (Table 3). We analyzed stool samples from 18 vegetarians, semi-vegetarians
153   and non-vegetarians and found a range of metabolites that were significantly different (Table 4). Most
154   of the metabolites that distinguished the dietary habits were from lipid classes such as ceramides and
155   phosphatidylcholines. Some metabolism indicators were also found to be different between
156   vegetarians, semi-vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Most of the statistical significant ceramides were
157   higher abundant in non-vegetarians and the sum of ceramides was increasing from vegetarians to non-
158   vegetarians.

159   Discussion
160   There is no consensus so far how stool samples should be prepared for comparable, standardized
161   metabolomics measurements (8, 14). We were able to extract a broad range of metabolites with each
162   of the 8 defined protocols tested within this study. However, some methods should be preferred over
163   others in regards to the solvents used dependent on the aim of the study and if a broad or a specific
164   metabolic coverage is aimed for in a particular stool sample analysis. In this study the largest numbers
165   of metabolites could be measured after extraction with isopropanol and ethanol or methanol following
166   a drying step. We have seen differences in the measured metabolite concentration dependent on the
167   extraction method.
168   We observed that the stool processing methods differ, are not interchangeable and that metabolite
169   extraction efficiency varies. The metabolomics panels found by various research groups looking into
170   metabolomics stool sample analysis differ in metabolite composition which might by caused, amongst
171   other reasons, by the different stool processing methods. Studies that have focused on metabolomics in
172   stool samples used either PBS/D2O buffer (6, 7), acetonitrile (5), methanol (15) or methanol/water
173   mixture (1) for metabolite extraction and each buffer/ solvent results in specific biomarker panel for
174   the specific reagent applied. In this analysis, we used PBS, acetonitrile, methanol and additionally
175   other more complex biphasic (polar/ apolar) solvent combinations for metabolite extraction. The
176   principal procedure is similar for all protocols. A solvent or mixture of solvents is added to the thawed
177   stool samples and this mixture is homogenized and centrifuged so that that supernatant can be used for
178   metabolite analysis (14). We were able to extract a broad range of metabolites with each procedure but
179   the concentrations and the type of metabolites extracted, differ.
180   A total of 630 metabolites and various sums and ratios can be measured or calculated. The typical
181   number of metabolites that can be measured with this kit in human stool is 117 using an ethanol
182   phosphate buffer based protocol (16). When we used a protocol based on PBS, we were able to
183   measure only 88 compounds. Using different methods, we were able to extract and quantify up to 340
184   metabolites from human stool samples. Amino acids, amino acid related metabolites, bile acids, fatty
185   acids, nucleobases and related metabolites amongst others can be reliably measured with almost all

186   solvents. In contrast, the numbers of acylcarnitines, glycerophospholipids or triglycerides are low in
187   human stool which was also found by Wolf et al. (16).
188   In agreement with previously reported differences between fecal metabolomics of omnivores,
189   vegetarians and vegans (17), we observed metabolite differences between vegetarians and non-
190   vegetarians. In particular, we found major differences between stool samples from vegetarians and
191   non-vegetarians in the lipid classes. Non-vegetarians were shown to have higher intake of total fat
192   compared to vegetarians (18). The significant differences in amount of metabolites of lipid classes in
193   non-vegetarians compared to vegetarians found in our study might reflect the difference in fat intake.
194   In meat-eaters, higher blood levels of glycerophospholipids or sphingolipids were found compared to
195   vegetarians or vegans as the most important sources for those metabolites are animal products (19).
196   Furthermore, it was found by different studies that meat intake is associated with the TMAO
197   metabolism as meat and meat products are rich in substances needed for the synthesis of TMAO (20).
198   In contrast, we did not find any differences in fecal TMAO. Other studies found higher amounts of
199   amino acid metabolites and bile acids excretion in urine from meat eaters as they have higher intake of
200   proteins compared to people with high vegetable intake (21). In stool samples, we did not find
201   different amounts of amino acids or bile acids between vegetarians and non-vegetarians.
202   There are some limitations of this study. First, various solvents have different abilities to dissolve and
203   extract the metabolites of different classes and therefore there will be no comparable results when
204   using different processing methods within one study or across several studies. There is a very broad
205   range of chemical classes in metabolomics and not all metabolites can be extracted equally well with
206   the same methods. Second, stool composition varies greatly depending on antibiotic use (22), diet or
207   the water content that can be in a range from 63 to 85% (14). Drying the original stool samples taken
208   out of the freezer before processing offers the advantage of referring to similar actual weights,
209   avoiding bias due to difference in the water content among different samples (23). It is difficult though
210   to imagine study participants to dry their stool samples and then freeze them in small amounts with
211   equal weights for standardization and avoiding freeze-thaw cycles. One would also need to collect
212   more wet weight stool to get enough dry weight stool for a standardized metabolomics analyses. In
213   addition, it is still an obstacle for many people to collect their stool samples for study purposes, freeze

214   them at home and finally transport them in a freezing device to their physician. And even for
215   laboratories, processing stool samples in a consistent way is a challenge also due to its varying
216   consistency. Another point are contaminations and variations introduced into the stool samples that
217   can result from toilet water or from urine, which we tried to minimize using a stool collection aid (24).
218   Further limitations are the small samples size and inclusion of healthy individuals only.
219   A major strength of this study is that we have tested various metabolite extraction protocols on the
220   same analytical platform. Stool samples are very promising in metabolomics research for CRC as they
221   directly represent the microbial activities and the cellular environment in the gut (4). The stool
222   samples were only frozen once which should ensure good metabolite stability: Composition might
223   locally differ since the 50mg were cut off as frozen biomass from the total stool sample without
224   thawing and mixing the complete stool sample.
225   In conclusion, we found a broad range of metabolites measurable in human stool samples. Some
226   chemical classes can be measured equally well with all protocols whereas others are highly dependent
227   on the extraction method. The extraction methods using (a) isopropanol or (b) ethanol or methanol and
228   MTBE including drying of the supernatant seem to be preferable over others for further metabolomics
229   analyses. To our knowledge this is the first study in stool metabolomics comparing 8 different
230   protocols for metabolite extraction with a novel highly standardized and quality controlled,
231   quantitative and reproducible assay and evaluating one methodology, the for our purpose most
232   favorable protocol, to evaluate metabolites in stool samples of participants with different dietary
233   habits.
234   There is urgent need for a consensus on standard procedures for stool processing for metabolomics
235   and for quantitative and reproducible assays to get comparable results across different studies and
236   laboratories.
