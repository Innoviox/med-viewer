26     Abstract
27     Development of antibody protection during SARS-CoV-2 infection is a pressing question for public
28     health and for vaccine development. We developed highly sensitive SARS-CoV-2-specific
29     antibody and neutralization assays. SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein or Nucleocapsid protein specific
30     IgG antibodies at titers more than 1:100,000 were detectable in all PCR+ subjects (n=115) and
31     were absent in the negative controls. Other isotype antibodies (IgA, IgG1-4) were also detected.
32     SARS-CoV-2 neutralization was determined in COVID-19 and convalescent plasma at up to
33     10,000-fold dilution, using Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviruses, which were also blocked by
34     neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Hospitalized patients had up to 3000-fold higher antibody and
35     neutralization titers compared to outpatients or convalescent plasma donors. Interestingly, some
36     COVID-19 patients also possessed NAbs against SARS-CoV Spike protein pseudovirus.
37     Together these results demonstrate the high specificity and sensitivity of our assays, which may
38     impact understanding the quality or duration of the antibody response during COVID-19 and in
39     determining the effectiveness of potential vaccines.

44     Introduction
45     Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused the
46     COVID-19 pandemic, enters target cells through the interaction of its envelope Spike protein with
47     the primary host cell receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is then cleaved
48     by a serine protease (TMPRSS2) to allow viral fusion and entry across the cell membrane1.
49     Antibodies that can bind to the Spike protein have the potential to neutralize viral entry into cells
50     and are thought to play an important role in the protective immune response to SARS-CoV-2
51     infection2-11
52
53     To predict protection against SARS-CoV-2, it is critical to understand the quantity, quality and
54     duration of the antibody responses during different stages of COVID-19 and in the convalescent
55     period. In this regard, assessing the level of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that block viral entry
56     into cells could be a critical parameter in determining protection from SARS-CoV-2 and
57     management of convalescent plasma therapies, which are being tested as a COVID-19 treatment
58     option12-15. Defining the relationship between disease severity, other individual-specific co-
59     morbidities and the neutralizing antibody responses will be critical in our understanding of COVID-
60     19 and in tailoring effective therapies.
61
62     Currently available SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests mostly lack sufficient dynamic range and
63     sensitivity to allow for accurate detection or determination of the magnitude of the antibody
64     response16. Furthermore, potential cross-reactivity among SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies to
                                                                                                           17-20
65     other endemic coronaviruses could also be confounders in these tests                                      , thus making them
66     less reliable. Determining neutralization activity in patient plasma also has challenges, as these
67     assays generally rely on live virus replication, requiring a high-level biohazard security BSL-3 level
68     laboratory. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop sensitive antibody and virus

69     neutralization assays that are sufficiently robust for screening and monitoring large numbers of
70     SARS-CoV-2 infected or convalescent subjects.
71
72     To overcome these experimental challenges, here we developed: 1) Highly sensitive bead-based
73     fluorescent immunoassay for measuring SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels and isotypes, and
74     2) Robust SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein pseudovirus to measure NAb levels in COVID-19 patient
75     plasma. We found striking differences in total antibody levels and neutralization titers between
76     hospitalized or severe COVID-19 patients relative to outpatient or convalescent plasma donors,
77     which were obtained with the purpose of transfer to and treatment of patients. Significant
78     correlations between antibody levels and neutralization titers, age and NAbs to SARS-CoV were
79     also observed. These assays and findings have important implications for assessing the breadth
80     and depth of the humoral immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection and for the
81     development of effective antibody-based therapies or vaccines.

83     Results
84     Development of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody assay
85     Determining antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects remains challenging, due to
86     lack of sufficient dynamic range to determine precise antibody titers with antibody isotypes
87     simultaneously. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a fluorescent bead-based
88     immunoassay that takes advantage of the high dynamic range of fluorescent molecules using
89     flow cytometry (Fig. 1a). In this assay, we immobilized biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein
90     receptor binding domain (RBD) or the Nucleoprotein (N) on streptavidin beads to detect specific
91     antibodies from patient plasma (Fig. 1a). Different antibody isotypes were measured using anti-
92     Ig (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgG1-4) specific secondary antibodies conjugated to a fluorescent tag (Fig. 1a).
93     Using either anti-S-RBD antibody or soluble ACE2-Fc, we show very high sensitivity in detecting

 94     Spike protein binding, down to picogram ranges (Fig. 1b). Similarly, S-RBD-specific antibodies
 95     were detectable in serial dilutions up to 100,000-fold of plasma samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR+
 96     subjects at high specificity and sensitivity (Fig. 1c). We then used the titration curves from COVID-
 97     19 convalescent and healthy control plasma to normalize the area under the curve (AUC) values
 98     to quantitate the antibody levels (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Negative threshold values were set
 99     using healthy control AUC levels plus one standard deviation of the mean.
100
101     In addition to S-RBD and Nucleocapsid protein, we also attached different viral components such
102     as S1 subunit of Spike protein, S1 subunit N Terminal Domain (NTD) and S2 Extracellular Domain
103     (ECD) onto the magnetic beads and tested IgG levels specific to those viral proteins to compare
104     the antibody levels they detect. Interestingly, S-RBD captured significantly more antibodies
105     compared to S1 which is the subunit of Spike protein that contains S-RBD (Fig. 1d).
106
107     We also evaluated the dynamic range of our assay by screening some of the plasma samples
108     with a commercial ELISA-based antibody assay next to our bead-based assay and comparing
109     the detected antibody levels. Antibody levels from the two antibody assays showed a high
110     correlation (!! = 0.86), confirming our assay’s precision, and the bead-based antibody assay
111     showed a wider dynamic range compared to the ELISA-based assay. (Fig. 1e)
112
113     Using bead-based assay, we screened COVID-19 patient or convalescent plasma samples
114     (Table-1; n=115) for total S-RBD and Nucleocapsid specific IgG AUC values of COVID-19 positive
115     subjects, which varied 3-logs from ~104 to ~107 (Fig. 2a). S-RBD specific IgM (40/40) and IgA
116     (115/115) were also detectable and above the negative control threshold in all subjects (Fig. 2a).
117     Statistical sensitivity and specificity estimates of our bead-based antibody assays were 100% and
118     99.34% for S-RBD IgG; 100% and 90.9% for S-RBD IgM, 94.26% and 87.87% for S-RBD IgA and

119     99.13% and 94.93% for Nucleocapsid IgG, respectively. Furthermore; S1 subunit, S1 N Terminal
120     Domain (NTD), S2 Extracellular Domain (ECD) and Nucleocapsid protein-specific IgG and S-RBD
121     specific IgA levels positively correlated with S-RBD IgG antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c)
122     with the highest correlation with S1 IgG (!! = 0.987). Notably, IgG1 subclass antibody levels were
123     comparable to total IgG levels whereas the other subtypes were relatively lower (Fig. 2b). There
124     were significant differences in S-RBD or Nucleocapsid antibody levels between outpatient,
125     hospitalized, and ICU/deceased subjects, with the highest levels observed in the most severe
126     cases (Fig. 2c, d, e). Importantly, subjects who had recovered from COVID-19 and were also
127     potential donors for convalescent plasma therapy (hereafter referred to as plasma donors), also
128     had significantly lower antibody titers than hospitalized, intensive care unit (ICU) or deceased
129     patients (Fig. 2c, d, e). Overall, individual S-RBD and Nucleocapsid IgG levels appeared to
130     correlate with their IgA and IgG subclass (IgG1-4) responses to S-RBD (Supplementary Fig. 1d).
131     Subdividing the subjects by sex did not reveal any statistical difference in IgG levels at any of the
132     disease stages (Fig. 2f).

137     Development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein pseudovirus
138     Next, we sought to develop a sensitive and high throughput SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay by
139     incorporating SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein into lentiviruses to assess specific inhibition of viral
140     entry. To produce Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviral particles, we first ensured expression of
141     the Spike protein on the cell membrane of transfected 293 cells, from which it would incorporate
142     into the lentiviruses. Human codon optimized SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequences with and
143     without endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (ERRS), which would be predicted to be more
144     efficiently expressed on the cell surface membranes, were cloned into an expression vector and
145     transfected into 293 cells. To evaluate membrane expression of Spike protein, cells were stained
146     with recombinant soluble ACE2-Fc fusion protein followed by a secondary staining with an anti-
147     Fc antibody (Fig 3a). The percentage of Spike protein over-expressing cells was similar in the
148     presence or absence of ERRS, but cells expressing Spike protein without ERRS showed a higher
149     geometric mean of expression (Fig. 3b). As such, we used Spike protein lacking the ERRS for
150     lentiviral pseudotyping to ensure its higher incorporation onto viral membranes.
151
152     We then co-transfected 293 cells with replication defective lentivectors encoding GFP or RFP
153     reporter genes and the Spike protein encoding plasmid and harvested the supernatant at 24
154     hours, which was then used to infect cells expressing ACE2 (Fig. 3c). Bald particles were
155     generated by transfecting lentivirus plasmids without any envelope and used as a negative
156     control. Next, we tested the transduction efficiency of the viruses on wild type 293 cells, given
157     they express low levels of endogenous ACE2 (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). While we found clearly
158     defined infection of 293 cells with Spike-protein pseudovirus compared to bald virions, infection
159     rate determined by GFP or RFP expression was relatively low (Fig. 3d). We therefore generated
160     human-ACE2 over-expressing 293 cells with a GFP reporter (ACE2-IRES-GFP) or fused to
161     fluorescent mKO2 protein (ACE2-mKO2). ACE2 overexpression of ACE2-IRES-GFP or ACE2-

162     mKO2 was confirmed by staining with SARS-CoV-2 Spike-protein S1 subunit fused with mouse
163     Fc (mFc) and anti-mFc secondary antibody (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Indeed, these ACE2 over-
164     expressing 293 cells (293-ACE2) were efficiently transduced with Spike protein pseudoviruses
165     encoding either GFP or RFP (Fig. 3e). The efficiency of Spike-protein pseudovirus infection was
166     comparable in ACE2-IRES-GFP or ACE2-mKO2 fusion protein (Fig. 3e), and therefore both were
167     used in subsequent neutralization experiments. In addition, we developed SARS-CoV Spike
168     protein pseudotyped lentivirus, which similarly infected 293-ACE2 cells at almost 100% efficiency
169     at higher virus supernatant volumes (Fig. 3f). We also tested the stabilities of SARS-CoV-2 and
170     SARS-CoV Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviruses after serial freeze/thaw cycles and found that
171     their infectivity remained mostly similar with little loss of activity after 3 cycles (Fig. 3f).
172
173     Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein pseudovirus with soluble ACE2,
174     NAbs and COVID-19 plasma
175     We next investigated whether Spike protein pseudoviruses could be neutralized by soluble ACE2
176     (sACE) or Spike protein specific NAbs (Fig. 4a). For this experiment, Spike protein pseudotyped
177     SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses were pre-cultured with different concentrations of
178     sACE2 or NAbs, then added to 293-ACE2 cells. Subsequently, infection was determined 3 days
179     post-infection based on GFP or RFP expression as described above. sACE2 neutralized both
180     SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudovirus infections in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 4b, c),
181     although neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 was slightly better than that of SARS-CoV pseudoviruses
182     (Fig. 4b, c, and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Furthermore, Spike-RBD specific NAb neutralized SARS-
183     CoV-2 pseudovirus entry much more efficiently than sACE2 but had no effect on SARS-CoV
184     pseudovirus (Fig. 4c). One of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD specific antibodies (non-NAb) did not show
185     any neutralization of SARS-CoV-2, however very low level neutralization of SARS-CoV
186     pseudovirus was detected (Fig. 4c). We also observed measurable differences in the neutralizing

187     activity of four different NAbs and two different soluble ACE2 proteins from different sources (Fig.
188     4d), showing the utility of this assay for such screening. Taken together, these experiments
189     demonstrate that the combination of pseudotyped viruses and 293-ACE2 cells can be used to
190     generate highly sensitive SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV neutralization assays.
191
192     Using this approach, we then tested neutralization titers from COVID-19 patients or seropositive
193     donors with serial dilution of their plasma. Accordingly, plasma samples in 3-fold serial dilutions
194     were incubated with Spike pseudovirus and added to 293-ACE2 cells and infection was
195     determined as described in Figure 4. Healthy control plasma samples were used as negative
196     controls whereas anti-S-RBD NAb served as a positive control (Fig. 5a). None of the control
197     plasma (n=34, 1 shown in Fig. 5a) tested showed any neutralization activity, whereas patient
198     plasma efficiently neutralized the virus at up to 10,000-fold serial dilution (Fig. 5a). The 50%
199     neutralization titer (NT50), was determined using the half-maximal inhibitory concentration values
200     of plasma samples, normalized to control infections, from their serial dilutions. Importantly, the
201     NT50 values of the subjects were much higher in hospitalized patients than in outpatients (Fig.
202     5b). NT50 values for hospitalized and ICU/deceased subjects were also up to 1000-fold higher
203     than convalescent plasma donors (Fig. 5b). Hospitalized males and females, separately, also
204     remained higher in their NT50 levels and no difference was observed within each group (Fig. 5c).
205
206     We also tested whether SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ plasma could neutralize the SARS-CoV pseudovirus.
207     104 plasma samples from all groups were tested for their ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and
208     SARS-CoV pseudoviruses. Remarkably, most of the plasma samples also neutralized SARS-CoV
209     pseudovirus, although less efficiently than SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (Fig. 5d). Interestingly,
210     NT50 levels of plasma samples for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV significantly correlated in
211     hospitalized subjects (Fig. 5e), whereas there were no correlations in outpatients and plasma

213     compared the severity groups for their SARS-CoV NT50 values, we did not observe any
214     significant difference between the groups (Supplementary Fig. 5b).
215
216     Correlations of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, antibody levels and COVID-19
217     subject characteristics
218     To better understand the associations between patient characteristics and the humoral immune
219     response in COVID-19, we next determined correlations between antibody AUC levels, NT50
220     values and demographics of the study subjects. First, we assessed the correlation between NT50
221     values with S-RBD or Nucleocapsid antibody titers or their subclasses. All Igs including S-RBD
222     IgG (!! = 0.81), Nucleocapsid IgG (!! = 0.689), S-RBD IgA (!! = 0.60) and S-RBD IgM (!! = 0.47)
223     showed significant correlation with NT50 values of each subject (Fig. 6a). Among Ig subclasses
224     specific to S-RBD; IgG1 (!! = 0.80), IgG3 (!! = 0.69) and IgG2 (!! = 0.67) and, to a lesser degree,
225     IgG4 (!! = 0.51) also correlated with NT50 values (Fig. 6b). Total S-RBD IgG also correlated in a
226     similar fashion with other IgG isotypes, with IgG1 showing the highest positive correlation (!! =
227     0.96) (Supplementary Fig. 4a).
228
229     Next, we correlated the antibody AUC levels and NT50 values of the subjects with their age.
230     Subjects had significantly higher S-RBD IgG (!! = 0.53), Nucleocapsid IgG (!! = 0.43), S-RBD IgA
231     (!! = 0.41) and NT50 (!! = 0.579) values, as their age increased (Fig. 6c).
232
233     We also explored the relationship of the number of days between PCR test result and blood draw
234     with antibody levels or NT50 values, excluding the subjects that had 15 days or fewer between
235     those dates to ensure that antibody levels had already reached their peak. Of note, there was no

236     correlation between the number of days and the IgG to S-RBD or the NT50 (Supplementary Fig.
237     4b), suggesting a potential persistence in antibody titers at least for 3 month duration in this cohort.

239     Discussion
240     The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to spread globally unabated, including within the United
241     States. There is an urgent need to better understand the immune response to the virus so that
242     effective immune-based treatments and vaccines can be developed21,22. Neutralization of the
243     virus by antibodies (NAbs) is one of the goals to achieve protection against SARS-CoV-223.
244     Despite rapid development of many serological tests, important questions about the quality and
245     quantity of seroprevalence in individuals remains still unclear24,25. Here, we developed highly
246     sensitive and specific humoral assays that measure both the magnitude and neutralization
247     capacity of antibody responses in COVID-19 patients. Every SARS-CoV-2 infected subject we
248     tested (n=115) had detectable antibodies and all subjects except one exhibited neutralization;
249     both of these qualities were completely absent in non-infected controls. However, there was a
250     profound difference in antibody and neutralization titers among subjects, ranging in more than
251     1000-fold differences. Furthermore, we found that almost all COVID-19 patients also had
252     neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV, suggesting a high degree of cross-reactivity between these
253     two virus Spike proteins.
254
255     One of our key findings was clustering of antibody responses based on severity of the disease;
256     as hospitalized patients showed much higher antibody levels and neutralization capacity than
257     outpatient subjects or convalescent plasma donors. This finding is consistent with recent reports
258     suggesting that patients with more severe disease contain relatively higher levels of antibodies
259     for SARS-CoV-2 infection2,26-30. Interestingly, most of the convalescent plasma donors had much
260     lower levels of neutralizing antibodies (by at least an order of magnitude) than hospitalized

261     patients, who would be the suitable recipients for such plasma transfer therapy. This finding raises
262     the question of whether convalescent plasma transfers may actually provide benefit to severe
263     COVID-19 patients by providing neutralizing antibodies. It may perhaps be more beneficial to
264     identify donors with much higher neutralizing antibody titers for the plasma donation. As such, our
265     findings point to the importance of having access to assays that have a large dynamic range to
266     detect antibody responses in COVID-19 patients or seropositive individuals. This neutralization
267     assay also revealed differences in commercial antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in their capacity to
268     block virus entry, and as such can be used for rapid identification or generation of synthetic NAbs.
269     In addition to measuring neutralization titers, the pseudoviruses can be used to probe cells that
270     have the potential to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, given lentiviruses can infect most cell types
271     and do not require cell division to integrate into the genome. This infection assay may also be
272     used to screen small molecules that may impact virus cell entry.
273
274     Along with SARS-CoV-2, we also developed a pseudotyped lentivirus with SARS-CoV Spike
275     protein, which was equally efficient at infecting ACE2 overexpressing cells. This finding is
276     consistent with results that SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in complex binding with human ACE2
277     (hACE2) is similar overall to that observed for SARS-CoV31. There was however slightly better
278     neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry than SARS-CoV with soluble ACE2, which could be due
279     to key residue substitutions in SARS-CoV-2, creating a slightly stronger interaction and thus
280     higher affinity for receptor binding than SARS-CoV Spike protein31. Accordingly, we also tested
281     the ability of COVID-19 patient plasma for SARS-CoV neutralizing capacity and found significant
282     SARS-CoV specific neutralization in COVID-19 patients. However, the neutralization titers for
283     SARS-CoV were significantly lower and there was no correlation with the neutralization activity
284     against SARS-CoV-2 when all severity groups were combined. Indeed, some donors even had
285     relatively higher SARS-CoV neutralization (Fig. 5e). Although there was significant correlation

286     between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV NT50 levels when hospitalized and ICU/Deceased
287     subjects were analyzed separately. Given that the two viruses share ~75% identical amino acid
288     sequences in their Spike proteins and there are conserved epitopes between them32, it is
289     conceivable that some of the SARS-CoV-2 NAbs have cross-neutralizing activity33,34. It is
290     noteworthy that a recent study showed a NAb developed for SARS-CoV was highly effective at
291     neutralizing SARS-CoV-235. It is also tempting to speculate that presence of SARS-CoV specific
292     NAbs could be more potent perhaps by targeting highly conserved regions of the Spike protein,
293     making it more difficult for the virus to select for escape mutants.
294
295     Other antibody and neutralization assays have been developed during the submission of our
296     manuscript2,3,9,36-40. Although direct comparison is difficult due to differences in the assay
297     methodologies and different sample sets, we believe our assays embody distinctive features that
298     further enhance this critically important immune response to SARS-CoV-2. The use of the flow
299     cytometry bead based fluorescent system that detects Spike or Nucleocapsid protein bound
300     antibodies provides a high-throughput assay with a very high dynamic range and sensitivity, as it
301     could detect antibodies from some subjects at up to a million-fold dilution of the plasma. This
302     assay is also scalable and can be easily adaptable to other viral antigens. Using a flow cytometry
303     platform is also important in that the assay can be further developed in a single panel to identify
304     all antibody isotypes simultaneously and to complement flow cytometric immune phenotyping of
305     COVID-19 patients. The high sensitivity and specificity of our assay has allowed us to correlate
306     the Spike protein RBD-specific antibody levels with neutralization titers, which showed very high
307     concordance, and thus can be utilized as a proxy for neutralization in a clinical setting.
308     Furthermore, the bead-based immunoassay can also be further developed to screen for
309     antibodies reacting to other SARS-CoV-2 antigens simultaneously and can be useful in identifying
310     antibodies that cross-react between different species of coronavirus proteins. Determining other

311     isotypes such as IgA and IgG subclasses may also help in future mechanistic studies. It is clear
312     that the dominant antibody response in almost all donors was IgG1, but some also show high IgA
313     and IgG2-4, at varying levels. For example, given the importance of IgA antibodies in providing
314     immunity on mucosal surfaces within the respiratory system, SARS-CoV-2 RBD-spike protein
315     specific IgA levels may also play an important role in the upper and lower respiratory system, or
316     perhaps also in the gut, of COVID-19 patients41,42.
317
318     There are also several potential practical implications to our findings. First, the patient population
319     with the greatest risk factors for severe outcomes from infection such as age and co-morbid
320     conditions had the highest antibody titers as well as neutralization of the virus. This is also the
321     case for those patients who had lethal disease. It is therefore possible that surviving COVID-19
322     may require non-antibody dependent factors or that producing too much antibody may even have
323     deleterious effects43, such as potential antibody-dependent enhancement phenomenon by
324     triggering Fc receptors on macrophages44. In this regard, it is interesting to note that a Bruton
325     tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that targets Fc-receptor signaling in macrophages is being tested
326     in a randomized clinical trial 45. Thus, understanding the mechanism of survival from COVID-19
327     and immune response dynamics will be critical in the better prediction of outcomes as well as in
328     assaying for a protective response to potential vaccines.
329
330     In conclusion, the assays developed herein can have utility in uncovering dynamic changes in the
331     antibody levels in SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects over time, in responses to vaccines and as
332     potential clinical determinants for plasma or antibody therapies for COVID-19 patients.

362     Over-expression of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and cell culture
363     Human codon optimized SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequence was synthesized by
364     MolecularCloud (MC_0101081). 5’-ACGACGGAATTCATGTTCGTCTTCCTGGTCCTG-3’ and 5’-
365     ACGACGGAATTCTTAACAGCAGGAGCCACAGC-3’ primers were used to amplify the SARS-
366     CoV-2 Spike protein sequence without Endoplasmic Reticulum Retention Signal that is the last
367     19 amino acids33. Full length and truncated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences were then
368     cloned into pLP/VSVG plasmid from Thermo Fisher under CMV promoter after removing the
369     VSVG sequence via EcoRI-EcoRI restriction digestion. HEK-293T cells (ATCC; mycoplasma-free
370     low passage stock) were transfected with the expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000
371     (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol as previously described46. The cells were
372     cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS; Atlanta
373     Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA), 8% GlutaMAX (Life Technologies), 8% sodium pyruvate, 8%
374     MEM vitamins, 8% MEM nonessential amino acid, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all from
375     Corning Cellgro) for 72 hours, collected using %0.05 Trypsin-0.53 mM EDTA (Corning Cellgro)
376     and stained with Biotinylated Human ACE2 / ACEH Protein, Fc,Avitag (Acro Biosystems) then
377     stained with APC anti-human IgG Fc Antibody clone HP6017 (Biolegend). Samples were acquired
378     on a BD FACSymphony A5 analyzer and data were analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star).

381     Lentivector plasmids containing RFP or GFP reporter genes were co-transfected with either

386     transfection, filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter (Millipore) to remove cellular debris, and
387     concentrated with Lenti-X (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers protocol. Lentivirus
388     supernatant stocks were aliquoted and stored at −80°C. To measure viral titers, virus preps were
389     serially diluted on ACE2 over-expressing 293 cells. 72 hours after infection, GFP or RFP positive
390     cells were counted using flow cytometry and the number of cells transduced with virus
391     supernatant was calculated as infectious units/per mL.
392
393     Generating human ACE2 over-expressing cells
394     Wildtype ACE2 sequence was obtained from Ensembl Gene Browser (Transcript ID:
395     ENST00000252519.8) and codon optimized with SnapGene by removing restriction enzyme
396     recognition sites that are necessary for subsequent molecular cloning steps, preserving the amino
397     acid sequence. The sequence of mKO2 (monomeric Kusabira-Orange-247) obtained from
398     Addgene (#54625)48, and was added onto the C terminal end of ACE2 before the stop codon with
399     a small linker peptide (ccggtcgccacc) encoding the amino acids “PVAT”. The fusion constructs
400     were synthesized via GenScript and cloned into a lentiviral vector lacking a fluorescent reporter.
401     The full length human ACE2 sequence without fusion fluorescent proteins was amplified from the
402     ACE2-mKO2 fusion construct using 5’-ACGACGGCGGCCGCATGTCAAGCTCTTCCTGGC-3’
403     and 5’- ACGACGGAATTCTTAAAAGGAGGTCTGAACATCATCAG-3’ primers, generating a stop
404     codon at the C-terminus, and then cloned into a lentiviral vector encoding GFP reporter separated
405     from multiple cloning site via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence. To determine the
406     virus titers, HEK-293T cells were transduced with full length ACE2-IRES-GFP, ACE2-mKO2
407     fusion construct lentiviruses and analyzed via flow cytometry for their reporter gene expression
408     72 hours after infection. WT and ACE2 over-expressing HEK-293T were also stained with SARS-

414     To screen for antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, The DevScreen SAv Bead kit (Essen
415     BioScience, MI) was used. Biotinylated 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) Spike protein RBD, His, Avitag,

419     His recombinant protein (Sino Biological Inc.) were coated to SAv Beads according to
420     manufacturer’s instructions. Confirmation of successful bead conjugation was determined by
421     staining with anti-His Tag (Biolegend) and flow cytometry analysis. S-RBD, N, S1, S1-NTD and
422     S2-ECD conjugated beads were then used as capture beads in flow immunoassay where they
423     were incubated with anti-S-RBD human IgG positive control (provided in GenScript SARS-CoV-
424     2 Spike S1-RBD IgG & IgM ELISA Detection Kit as positive control), recombinant Human ACE2-
425     Fc (Acro Biosystems) or plasma and serum samples for 1 hour at room temperature. Plasma
426     samples were assayed at a 1:100 starting dilution and 3 additional 10-fold serial dilutions. Anti-S-
427     RBD antibody and ACE2-Fc were both tested at a 5 µg/mL starting concentration and in additional

448     4d), recombinant human ACE2-Fc (Acro Biosystems, sACE2#1 and GenScript, sACE2#2 (Fig
449     4d) or plasma from COVID-19 convalescent individuals and healthy donors were incubated with
450     RFP-encoding SARS-CoV-2 or GFP-encoding SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus with 0.2 multiplicity
451     of infection (MOI) for 1 hour at 37°C degrees. The mixture was subsequently incubated with 293-
452     ACE2 cells for 72h hours after which cells were collected, washed with FACS buffer (1xPBS+2%
453     FBS) and analyzed by flow cytometry using BD FACSymphony A5 analyzer. Percent infection
454     obtained was normalized for samples derived from cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV
455     pseudotyped virus in the absence of plasma, ACE2-Fc or monoclonal antibodies. The half-
456     maximal inhibitory concentration for plasma (NT50), ACE2-Fc or monoclonal antibodies (IC50)
457     was determined using 4-parameter nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism 8.0).

460     Statistical Analyses
461
462     All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism V8 software. Continuous variable
463     datasets were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric datasets when comparing
464     clinical groups, and exact P values are reported. Spearman p analysis was used to determine the
465     relationship existing between two sets of non-parametric data, where a value of 0 indicated no
466     relationship, values between 0 and +/-0.3 indicated a weak relationship, values between +/-0.3
467     and +/-0.7 indicated a moderate relationship, values between +/-0.7 and +/-1.0 indicated a strong
468     relationship, and a value of +/-1.0 indicated a perfect relationship between sets of data. 49
