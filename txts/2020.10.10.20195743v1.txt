             ABSTRACT
             Aim
                        Longitudinal global strain (LGS) is reduced in obese patients with normal ejection
             fraction of the left ventricle. TAPSE/PAPS ratio, recently described, may be a step forward a
             more efficient RV function evaluation.
                        There are still few publications in the application of these methods in pediatric patients.
             Methods
                        This case-control study compared 104 children aged 5-18 years between October 2017
             and February 2019, 52 obese children with body mass index (BMI) > +2 SD, and 52 matched
             controls.
                        They were screened for other cardiovascular risk factors like insulin resistance or
             hypercholesterolemia. A complete echocardiography including standard and functional
             parameters was performed.
             Results
                        We found that obese children presented poor systolic function (LGS -15,90 ± 3,84 %) in
             comparison with non-obese children (-19,44 ± 5,75 %, p=0,001). LGS correlated positively with
             body mass index (BMI).
                        Standard echocardiography also revealed cardiomegaly and hypertrophy.
                        TAPSE/PASP ratio correlated negatively with triglycerides levels (β -0,402, p=0,014).
             Diastolic function was poor in those with HOMA-IR (β -0,375, p=0,016) and hypertriglyceridemia
             (β -0,375 p=0,024).
             Conclusion
                        We think that is necessary to perform a standarised cardiovascular evaluation in obese
             children for early identification of subclinical dysfunction especially in those with insulin
             resistance and dyslipidemia

             FULL ARTICLE
             Introduction
             The prevalence of overweight among children in developed and developing countries is
             continuing to increase1. Nearly 40% of paediatric population in our midst are either obese or
                            2
             overweight . One of the most important efforts in public health nowadays in the first world is
             obesity in children and adolescents. Obese children may be at risk for consequences, both
             short-term health and long-term tracking of obesity to adulthood3.
                        Intense correspondences between obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) have
             been shown in many studies. In fact, obesity has been considered an independent risk factor for
             CVD and CVD risks in obese children. Indeed, literature has described the relationship between
             BMI in adolescence and all-cause mortality4.
                        At present, the secondary and tertiary prevention measures are the most important
             points to fight against cardiovascular desease5. However, efforts to analyse modifiable risk
             factors present in children and adults over a long time have not been a priority to date2.
                        Obesity in children and adolescents is related with an amount of cardiovascular
             changes that are interlinked to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adulthood.
             Children exhibit early signs of cardiovascular dysfunction as a result of their excess adiposity as
             recent studies have shown, frequently independent of other obesity-related comorbidities such
             as insulin resistance, hypertension or dyslipemia. Clinical testimony to date suggests that the
                                                                                                                 6
             cardiovascular injure seen in middle-aged adults is also happening in obese children ,
             particularly in those with a central fat distribution.
                        The major obesity-induced changes described are dilatation of left ventricular
             structures, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, heart failure.

             Many studies have demonstrated that an appropriate detection and treatment of these
             cardiovascular damages in early phases is important in order to slow down and reverse the
             process in high-risk pediatric populations 7.
                        New echocardiographic procedures are developed to accomplish accurate evaluation of
             myocardial deformation ( both segmental and global) . The newly released development is the
             two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D STE), a routine for assessing
                                                                              8
             myocardial strain and measure deformation function .
                        Two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging is a suitable method for assessing
             ventricular function and identifying sub-clinical dysfunction. It provides information which is not
             available with any of the echocardiographic parameters used at the present time. STE provides
             an impartial quantification of myocardial deformation and left ventricular systolic and diastolic
             dynamics. One of this value is that this technique is angle-independent. Results regarding the
             viability, exactitude and clinical application of speckle-tracking echocardiography are quickly
             accumulating9. In literature, there are still few publications in the application of this method in
             pediatric population.
             Methods
             Study design
                        The aim of the study was to analyse LV function using 2D speckle tracking in obese
             pediatric patients referred from the Endocrinology consult with BMI >+2 DS, and to contrast
             their data with non-obese patients with structurally normal hearts and same age and sex.
                        We used preceding researches where LV Doppler-derived strain was contrasted
             between obese and non-obese children for sample size estimation.
             A number of 45 patients in a cluster was estimated to provide a 90% power to identify the
             clinical outcome of interest (20% strain value difference between groups), with a significance
                                                       10
             level (alpha) of 0.05 (two-tailed) .

                        This case-control matched study was made between October 2017 and February 2019.
             Body mass index (BMI)
                                                                                                        2
                        Body mass index was calculated by the formula weight (kg)/height (m ). Obesity was
             contemplated when BMI exceeded >+2 SD for sex and age based reference values.
             Blood pressure (BP)
                        Blood pressure was measured with an appropriate cuff in supine position in the
             Endocrinology consult. Patients with hypertension (systolic and/or diastolic BP over the 90th
             percentile for sex and height) were excluded off the study.
             Laboratory findings
                        In all obese children a complete analytic was obtained: fasting blood glucose,
             glycosilated haemoglobin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR),
             lipidic profile and calcium phosphate metabolism.
             Cardiovascular evaluation
                        Including personal interview (functional class, physical activity level, sleep quality,
             familiar and personal cardiological backgrounds), and physical examination (cardiopulmonary
             auscultation, pulse palpation).
                        A functional echocardiography was performed to all patients both standard (left
             ventricular end-diastolic diameter-LVEDD, ejection fraction-EF) and functional parameters
             (tricuspid annulus plane systolic excursion-TAPSE, estimation of pulmonary pressure for
             assesing the right ventricle-RV function; longitudinal global and regional strain, pulsed-wave
             Doppler and tissue-Doppler for assesing the left one).
             This study was made by only one observer using a Philips EpiQ team provided with Premium
             Ultrasound System technology.

                        TAPSE is a standard procedure to take the measurement of the distance of systolic
             excursion of the RV annular segment along its longitudinal plane, from a standard apical 4-
             chamber window, and represents longitudinal function of the RV11. Peak tricuspid regurgitation
             (TR) velocity was evaluated to calculate the RV-right atrial gradient and estimate pulmonary
                                                      12
             artery systolic pressure (PAPS) . TAPSE/PASP ratio is a substantial prognostic parameter in
             patients with pulmonary hypertension and is related with hemodynamic and functional class13.
             This ratio was subsequently calculated.
                        Left ventricular determinations were executed in concordance to the recommendations
             of the American Society of Echocardiography14. Ejection fraction was assessed using the
             Teichholz routine.
                        Diastolic function was analysed by the mitral inflow, pulsed-wave Doppler (PWD) and
             tissue-Doppler imaging (TDI). TDI was obtained at the lateral margin of the mitral annulus and
             the velocity of the e´ wave was measured. Principal values of lateral e´ wave was captured and
             the E/e´ratio was descended from this mean value15.
                        The images obtained from standard apical 4-chamber, 3-chamber and 2-chamber views
             were then processed (echoPAC) to calculate the end-systolic longitudinal global strain (LGS)
             according with the consensus document of the European Association of Cardiovascular
             Imaging16.
             Statistical analysis
                        Descriptive analyzes of all the variables were carried out separately, using tables of
             absolute relative frequencies in the case of quantitative variables, and by mean ± SD, in the
             case of continuous quantitative variables. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess the
             normal distribution of the data.

                        The bivariate analysis was performed using the chi-square test for the comparison of
             proportions and those of Student Fisher-t to compare two means. Pearson´s linear correlation
             coefficient analysis was used to check the positive or negative correlation between BMI,
             laboratory and echocardiography parameters.
             p< 0,05 was considered statistically significant. All the statistical tests were bilateral, considering
             95% confidence level. The calculations was made with the help of the statistical package SPSS
             22.0.
             Results
                        The study included 52 obese children (25 boys and 27 girls, mean age 10,98 ± 1,63
             years) and 52 controls (32 boys and 20 girls, mean age 11,04 ± 2,91 years) referred to
             cardiologist by other reasons (murmur, thoracic pain or syncope) with structurally normal hearts.
                        Mean BMI in obese children was 28,37 ± 3,13 kg/m2, SD +2,54 ± 0,89.
                        Mean SBP and DBP in obese children was 117,64 ± 12,90 mmHg and 67,52 ± 9,85
             mmHg, respectively. One patient with systolic blood pressure (SBP) 165 mmHg and diastolic
             blood pressure (DBP) 85 mmHg confirmed by Ambulatory Measurement of Blood Pressure was
             excluded from the study.
                        Fourteen obese children presented limit total cholesterol 171-199 mg/dL and only one
             hypercolesterolaemia of 223 mg/dL. Four patients had levels of HDL fewer than 35 mg/dL.
             Hypertriglyceridaemia > 150 mg/dL was seen in five obese subjets.
                        14 patients (27%) presented vitamin D deficience.
                        17 patients (32,7%) were still not in puberty (Tanner <2).

                        The mean insulin value was 25,68 ± 12,05 μu/mL and HOMA-IR was 5,34 ± 2,39 in the
             obese subjects. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR > 2,5) was identified in 30 of them (57%).
                        The standard parameters between the both groups were compared in table 1. The
             thickness of interventricular septum-IVSd (p= 0,026), posterior wall-LPWd (p=0,018) and
             LVEDD (p= 0,005) were significantly greater in obese children, revealing cardiomegaly and
             hypertrophy in standard echocardiography.
                        Functional parameters are represented in Table 2. Pulmonary pressure was
             significantly higher in the case group (p= 0,002).
                        Longitudinal end-systolic global strain (LGS) was poor in obese children in comparison
             with controls, throwing a significant systolic subclinic dysfunction (p=0,001). Diastolic function
             assesed by PWD and TDI was not different between the two groups.
                        In Figure 1 is represented the global and regional strain in a control patient (“bull´s eye
             like”). LGS is derived from speckle tracking and analyzed by post-processing of apical images
             of the left ventricle (LV). Longitudinal shortening is expressed like a percentage.
                        The apical image of LV in a obese patient is showed in Figure 2. Note that inferior,
             anterior and anteroseptal wall present the worst changes in length in proportion to baseline.
             This is a relatively common find in our study but normal values of regional strain are not still
             validated in pediatric population.
                        Correlation between IMC and some laboratory data with ecocardiographic parameters
             are represented in Table 3. Those marked in bold are significant at p<0,05.
                        There was positive correlation between BMI and all standard parameters (IVSd, r 0,346,
             p=0,014; LVEDD, r 0,478, p=0,000; PWd, r 0,358, p=0,013), and between HOMA-IR with PWd
             (r 0,486, p=0,012).

                        Pulmonary pressure correlated positively with BMI (r 0,321, p=0,017), total cholesterol (r
             0,330 p=0,033) and triglycerides levels (r 0,460, p=0,005). However TAPSE/PAPS ratio
             correlated negatively with total cholesterol (r -0,419, p=0,006) and triglycerides levels (r -0,503,
             p=0,002).
                        We found significative positive relation between BMI and LGS (r 0,533, p=0,000).
             HOMA-IR (r -0,458, p=0,006), cholesterol (r -0,297, p=0,048) and triglycerides levels (r -0,402,
             p=0,011) correlated negatively with diastolic function of left ventricle estimated by E/A ratio with
             PWD. This correlation was not extensive to E/e´assesed by DTI.
                        Multiple linear regression analysis using the backwards method was performed. The
             dependent variable PWd was significantly correlated with HOMA-IR (β 0,486, p=0,012).
             Pulmonary pressure correlated positively with BMI (β 0,458, p=0,003) and total cholesterol (β
             0,347, p=0,023). TAPSE/PASP ratio correlated negatively with triglycerides levels (β -0,402,
             p=0,014). Diastolic function was affected by HOMA-IR (β -0,375, p=0,016) and triglycerides
             levels (β -0,375 p=0,024).
             Discusion
                        Obesity in children has become an authentic pandemic in developed countries.
             There are different criteria for defining overweight and obesity, to facilite the comparison
             between different studies and countries, taking into account the ethnic diversity and avoiding
             underestimation that involves comparing with populations in which obesity already existed.The
             criteria most commonly approved by the international scientific society are those recomended
             by International Obesity Task Force (IOTF)17 (cutoff points for childhood overweight or obesity
             particular to each BMI value and sex, using the reference population specified by the IOTF) and
                                                                                   18
             those proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO)                    (overweight, specific body mass
             index (BMI) values agreement to age and sex, >+1 standard deviation (SD) in the reference
             population characterised by the WHO; obesity: sex-and age-specific BMI values, >+2 SD). In
             our study we have chosen the WHO criteria.
                        Enkid study (1998-2000)19 has been the reference in obesity in children in Spain for
             many years, but it´s outdated.

             The two most recent national studies used direct height and weight measurement: ALADINO20
             (Diet, physical Activity, Childhood Development and Obesity) study with children aged 6 to 9.9
             years old; and a cross-sectional, observational study composed of children and adolescents of
             both sexes between 8 to 17 years old residing in family homes in mainland Spain2. The
             prevalence of overweight and obesity in this study is 26.0% and 12.6%, respectively.
             In our region the prevalence of obesity is quite higher (18,5%)21.
                        Among obese children, based on our results, standard echocardiography did not show
             anomalies in the global and segmental contractility. However, LVEDD, interventricular septum
             (IVSd) and posterior wall of left ventricle (LPWd) measured in diastole were significantly higher
             in obese group in comparison with controls (p =0,005, p=0,026 and p=0,018, respectively). A
             subgroup of obese children could present LV remodelling characterized by increased volume
             and wall thickness. These findings are superposable to Binnetoğlu et al´s22.
                                                                                     23
                        In healthy children, the mean LGS value is -20,5% . In our study, obese children
             compared with controls had lower 2D STE-derived LV LGS (-15,90 ± 3,84% vs 19,44 ± 5,75%,
             p=0,001). LGS in our study was not affected by sex or age.
             Similar observations of decreased longitudinal and circumferential strain in children with obesity
             were concluded by Kulkarni et al24. These findings are extensible to radial strain and early
             diastolic strain rate values25. Segmental analysis of the LV could provide in the future subtle
                                                                                                26
             markers for the emergence of future obesity-related cardiac disease .
                        Current guidelines recommend pulmonary hypertension screening in patients with
             severe obstructive sleep apnea. Prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in pediatric patients with
             obstructive sleep apnea is low and none of the patients with pulmonary hypertension had
                                                                                               27
             severe obstructive sleep apnea in a recent study over 163 patients                  . According to this in our
             study we found significative higher pulmonary pressure in obese children, but no one had
             pulmonary hypertension (PAPs over 40 mmHg).
                        Normal TAPSE values including z-scores based on patient age have been established
             in pediatric patients11. The TAPSE/PASP ratio has recently been reported as an independent

             prognostic parameter in heart failure. When stratified by tertiles, patients in the low tertile
                                                                                                                       13
             showed significantly compromised hemodynamic, functional and echocardiographic status .
             This index may be a step forward a more efficient RV function evaluation. In our sample
             TAPSE/PAPS was significantly negative correlated with triglycerides levels (β -0,402, p=0,014).
                        Diastolic function of obese participants was assessed by pulsed-wave Doppler (PWD)
             and TDI. We didn´t find a statistically significant difference that could indicate impaired LV filling
                                   28
             like Gandhi et al . However we found relation between HOMA-IR and triglycerides levels,
             correlated negatively with diastolic function of left ventricle estimated by E/A ratio with PWD. In
             previous studies LV early diastolic strain rate lower in hypercholesterolemic children compared

             with normals is also described .
                        And now the question is, can we take an active attitude with these patients that have
                                                                                                          30
             already remodeling and some index of RV and LV function altered? Gores et al describe an
             improvement in RV function assessed by TAPSE in a group of overweight patients participating
             in vigorous 3-month football training. We think next interventions could follow this line and select
             between the obese patients those that could beneficiate from personalized training and enter in
             a program of cardiac rehabilitation.
             Limitations
                        The statistical power of the analysis is limited by the small sample size.
                        There wasn´t positive correlation between HOMA-IR, cholesterol, triglycerides and
             remodelling of left ventricle31,32. One reason could be that we didn´t estimate the LV mass index.
                        We didn´t find relation between HOMA-IR, total cholesterol and triglycerides levels with
             LGS. Perhaps the view selection, defining end-systole or tracing the myocardium was not the
             most adequate in some patients that had bad window.

             Conclusion
                        Remodelling of LV and subclinic systolic dysfunction could be relatively common in
             asymptomatic patients with obesity and easily detected by functional echocardiography
             including TAPSE, PAPS and 2D-STE.
                        We think that is necessary to perform an standardized cardiovascular evaluation in
             obese children for early identification of subclinical dysfunction especially in those with insulin
             resistance and dyslipidemia
