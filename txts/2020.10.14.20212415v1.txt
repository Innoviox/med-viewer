27 Abstract
28           The first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Italy was detected on February the 20 th in
29 Lombardy region. Since that date, Lombardy has been the most affected Italian region by the
30 epidemic, and its healthcare system underwent a severe crisis during the outbreak. From a public
31 health point of view, therefore, it is fundamental to provide healthcare services with tools that can
32 reveal a possible new epidemic burden with a certain time anticipation, which is the main aim of the
33 present study. Moreover, the sequence of law decrees to face the epidemic and the large amount of
34 news generated in the population feelings of anxiety and suspicion. Considering this whole complex
35 context, it is easily understandable how people “overcrowded” social media with messages dealing
36 with the pandemic, and emergency numbers were overwhelmed by the calls. Thus, in order to find
37 potential predictors of a possible second epidemic wave, we analyzed data both from Twitter and
38 from emergency services comparing them to the daily infected time series at a regional level. Since
39 our principal goal is to forecast a possible new ascending phase of the epidemic, we performed a
40 wavelet analysis in the time-frequency plane, to finely discriminate over time the anticipation
41 capability of the considered potential predictors. In addition, a cross-correlation analysis has been
42 performed to find a synthetic indicator of the time delay between the predictor and the infected time
43 series. Our results show that Twitter data are more related to social and political dynamics, while
44 the emergency calls trends can be further evaluated as a powerful tool to potentially forecast a new
45 burden. Since we analyzed aggregated regional data, and taking into account also the huge
46 geographical heterogeneity of the epidemic spread, a future perspective would be to conduct the
47 same analysis on a more local basis.

52 Introduction
53
54           On February the 20th the first Italian case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (CoViD-19) due to
55 secondary transmission outside China was identified in Codogno, Lombardy region [1]. In the
56 following days the number of cases started to rise not only in Lombardy but also in other Italian
57 regions, although Lombardy remained and is still the most affected region in Italy [2]. At the time
58 of writing (October the 4th), 325,329 cases have been identified in Italy, out of which 108,065 in
59 Lombardy region [3].
60           The progressive decrease of CoViD-19 cases should not let our guard down, indeed it is
61 clear that, since the beginning of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-
62 2) pandemic, public health has suffered from the absence of a proper preparedness plan to face an
63 episode which was unexpected and unpredictable and has heavily impacted on the territorial and
64 hospital healthcare services. Planning has a fundamental role nowadays but it can be adequate only
65 if the next possible pandemic peak can be effectively foreseen by means of a predictive tool which
66 accounts for all the available signals. In order to do so, it is of paramount importance to learn from
67 what happened during the first peak to be prepared for the potential next one.
68           The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy has been characterized by a massive spread of news
69 coming from both official and unofficial sources leading to what has been defined as infodemia, an
70 over-abundance of information – some accurate and some not – that has made hard for people to
71 find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance needed [4].
72           Infodemia on SARS-CoV-2 created the perfect field to build suspicion in the population,
73 which was scared and not prepared to face this outbreak. It is understandable how the rapid increase
74 of the cases number, the massive spread of news and the adoption of laws to face this outbreak led
75 to a feeling of anxiety in the population, whose everyday life changed very quickly.
                                                                       3

 76           A way to assess the dynamic burden of social anxiety is a context analysis of major social
 77 networks activities over the internet. To this aim Twitter represents a possible ideal tool, because of
 78 the focused role of the tweets according to the more urgent needs of information and
 79 communication, rather than general aspects of social projection and debate as in the case of
 80 Facebook, which could provide slower responses for the fast individual and social context evolution
 81 dynamics [5].
 82           Taking into account this specific context, it is easy to understand why the 112 emergency
 83 number service in Lombardy region was suddenly overwhelmed by an enormous number of calls
 84 that rapidly overcame its capacity to cope and compromised the possibility to identify those patients
 85 who needed immediate medical assistance [6].
 86           As pointed out by the Scientific Italian Society for Medical Emergency (SIEMS), the
 87 number of calls to 112 for the Milan province was 5,086 on February the 16th, before the outbreak,
 88 and rapidly increased to 6,798 on February the 21st and to 10,657 on February the 22nd [7].
 89           The emergency service in Lombardy region is organized through three first-level PSAPs
 90 (public-safety answering points), called CUR-NUE (Unique answering operating room / point –
 91 European emergency number), which forward the call to the most appropriate service, i.e. Police,
 92 Fire Department or Medical emergency rescue service. So, after the first assessment, calls requiring
 93 medical assistance are sent to one of the four second-level PSAPs called SOREU (Regional
 94 Operating Rooms for Medical Emergency and Urgency), depending on the geographical area the
 95 call is coming from in order to evaluate the patient and decide the most appropriate intervention.
 96           Lombardy region, from an administrative point of view, is made up of twelve provinces, and
 97 the management of medical emergency calls occur in four operating rooms which receive these
 98 calls from different sets of provinces, namely:
 99    SOREU delle Alpi (SRA) from the provinces of Bergamo, Brescia and Sondrio;
100    SOREU dei Laghi (SRL) from the provinces of Como, Lecco and Varese;
101    SOREU Metropolitana (SRM) from the provinces of Milan and Monza-Brianza;
                                                                        4

102     SOREU della Pianura (SRP) from the provinces of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia.
103           Some of the non-urgent calls received by the four SOREU do not need, though, an
104 ambulance dispatch, so not all the calls result in a medical rescue mission: in the latter cases the
105 patients are recommended by SOREU medical technicians to consult other medical services such as
106 general practitioners. Moreover, during the epidemic, according to specific internal procedures,
107 SOREU medical technicians answering to the emergency calls, in the case of signs and/or
108 symptoms evocative of CoViD-19 but not life threatening, advised patients to wait for a recall by a
109 public health medical doctor: after this re-evaluation call, it was up to these medical doctors the
110 final decision on the management of the case (ambulance dispatch or home quarantine).
111           To reduce the burden of calls to the emergency number which occurred during the first days
112 of the outbreak, it was necessary to redirect non-urgent calls, especially those asking for
113 information, to other services. According to European Emergency Number Association guidelines
114 [8], Lombardy region created a regional toll-free number for CoViD-19, the first one in Italy. Other
115 Italian regions created their own one in the following weeks, as well as other European countries
116 like Spain, Germany, Croatia, which were facing similar issues [9].
117           The 24/24-hour toll-free number was settled on February the 23rd by AREU (Regional
118 Emergency Service Agency) and, although it helped to funnel non-urgent calls, it was not enough
119 because of the huge number of calls: for example on the second day it received more than 400,000
120 calls.
121           Calls to the emergency services could be an important and helpful indicator of the spread of
122 the infection among the population, taking into account the possibility to analyze data regarding the
123 municipality from which the calls originated and the motivations that induced people to ask for fast
124 medical support. Statistical models could be used to assess the association of these data with new
125 cases of CoViD-19 in order to predict new epidemic hotspots on a municipal scale, or with a
126 smaller spatial scale for big cities.
                                                                        5

127           In addition to usual public health indicators, social media data may also be used as probes of
128 the people behaviour according to the recent trends of digital epidemiology. As mobile technology
129 continues to evolve and proliferate, social media are expected to occupy an increasingly prominent
130 role in the field of infectious diseases [10-12] .
131           A recent systematic review concluded that the inclusion of online data in surveillance
132 systems has improved the disease prediction ability over traditional syndromic surveillance systems
133 and Twitter was the most common social network analyzed for this aim [13].
134           Despite some limitations and concerns, a better understanding of the behavioural change
135 induced by social media can strengthen mathematical modelling efforts and assist in the
136 development of public policy so as to make the best use of this increasingly ubiquitous resource in
137 controlling the spread of disease [11].
138           Aim of the study is to understand the correlation between the users calls to the emergency
139 services and the spread of the infection in the population during the first peak of the CoViD-19
140 outbreak in Lombardy region of Italy, the first world hotspot after the Chinese raise in Wuhan.
141 Furthermore, the joint analysis with Twitter trends related to emergency was performed to better
142 understand the most important population concerns according to the infection dynamics. Overall,
143 the joint active monitoring of the communication dynamics over emergency calls and social
144 networks like Twitter could provide an integrated means for the adaptive management of
145 information delivery as well as the optimization of the rescue logistic and finally it could provide
146 relevant anticipation on the outbreak. These aspects appear of critical importance for CoViD-19
147 surveillance, and for the preparedness of emergency and strategic plans [14].

152 Materials and methods
153
154 Data
155           In the present work, we analyzed the following time series:
156    PSAP-II SOREU-118 daily incoming calls from 2020.02.18 to 2020.03.30 [15];
157    PSAP-I CUR NUE-112 daily incoming calls from 2020.02.18 to 2020.03.30 [16];
158    toll-free number daily incoming calls from 2020.02.23 to 2020.03.30 [16];
159    daily Twitter data (tweets, replies, likes, retweets) from 2020.02.18 to 2020.06.29 [17];
160    daily infected from 2020.02.24 (the first day since which Italian Department for Civil Defense
161     has provided data) to 2020.06.29 [3].
162           Data about SOREU-118, NUE-112 and toll-free number daily incoming calls were only
163 available at a regional level. The very first days of the NUE and toll-free number time series have
164 been discarded due to the very intense population panic reaction which reflected into a very huge
165 amount of calls (whose peak was even higher than the following, new cases-related one).
166 Particularly, in the case of NUE they were inappropriate non-urgent calls (most of all for
167 information need), so they were not forwarded to the corresponding SOREU: indeed, in the SOREU
168 time series we do not observe any peak in the very first days. Moreover, this choice is justified if we
169 consider that – in case of a new epidemic burden – there would not be such a powerful reaction, so
170 to the aim of predictability we can take into account just the subsequent new increase in the calls to
171 NUE and toll-free number, which is more related to the CoViD-19 dynamics. Twitter data, instead,
172 differently from the emergency calls, were not geolocalized. Finally, daily new cases have been
173 collected at the province level and then aggregated at the regional level.

177 Twitter data analysis
178           The monitoring of the communication dynamics on online social media has been conducted
179 on Twitter [18]. Specifically, the Twitter Search API (Application Programming Interface) was
180 used to collect all the tweets in Italian language containing the keywords “112” or “118” in the
181 body text. The data span the period from 2020.02.18 to 2020.06.29. In addition, the text of the
182 tweets was further filtered to identify the most common keywords related to the emergency,
183 bringing to the manual identification of 290 keywords. To identify them, a POS (Part of Speech)-
184 tagger was run on each tweet, keeping the lemma of nouns and verbs. Then, all the terms which
185 occurred in the tweet corpus less than five times were discarded. Finally, all the tweets that did not
186 contain any keyword in the text were excluded from the Twitter dataset, leading to 5,989 statuses
187 used for the purpose of this paper. Since both the timestamp and the number of likes, retweets and
188 replies at the moment of the data collection were available for each tweet, it was possible to
189 reconstruct four time series related to the dynamics of the emergency calls on Twitter: 1) the
190 production of new statuses per day, 2) the number of retweets of new statuses per day, 3) the
191 number of likes per day, and 4) the number of replies per day. The latter is a first indicator of the
192 level of discussions triggered by the tweets, while the second one and the third one represent an
193 early approximation of the endorsement to the content of the tweet.
194
195 Wavelet analysis
196           Wavelets represent a powerful tool to analyze localized variations of non-stationary power
197 at many different frequencies in time series: the decomposition of the signal information in the
198 time-frequency domain, indeed, allows to bring out variability and its changes over time [19-22].
199 Particularly, wavelets can “capture” and detect in the time-frequency (scale) plane long-period (low
200 frequency) trends (properly called trends or backgrounds), and short-period (high frequency) trends
201 (called anomalies or discontinuities). Anomalies, despite their limited spatio-temporal location,
                                                                        8

202 possess a huge amount of information content, thus it is of primary importance to reveal them
203 adequately. Among the others, the wavelet transform has relevant features such as a good capability
204 of time-frequency localization (useful to analyze signals changing over time), and offers the
205 possibility of a multi-resolution representation over different scales [19]. Wavelets transforms,
206 differently from other series expansions, are thus a suitable tool to identify both a trend in a
207 nonparametric form, keeping significant local peaks, and variations from the trend [23-24].
208           In order to identify the trends, all the time series were first smoothed using a moving
209 average linear filter of a 7-days amplitude, decomposed through the wavelet transforms and then
210 normalized to their maximum values. Tweets-dependent data (daily number of replies, likes and
211 retweets) were also previously normalized to the correspondent number of daily tweets.
212           Details on the adopted continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and related measures are
213 reported in the Supplementary material. Briefly, first of all, the CWT of all the signal was
214 computed, together with the magnitude of the wavelet transform (using the modulus of the complex
215 values). After that, for each pair of time series, the following quantities were calculated: the
216 magnitude-squared wavelet coherence (MSWC), the wavelet cross-spectrum (WCS), the cone of
217 influence, the phase coherence relationship (using the argument of the complex values), the time
218 delay between the two signals (using the phase lag values). Each value of scale was converted to the
219 equivalent Fourier value of frequency, and thus to the correspondent period. However, note that the
220 relationship between scale and frequency is only an approximation, since there is not a precise
221 correspondence between the two: among others, Meyers and coll. (1993) proposed a method for the
222 conversion from scales to “pseudo-frequencies” [25].
223           Wavelet coherence and cross-spectrum analysis provides a detailed both time- and
224 frequency-localized information on the phase lag and thus on the time delay between the compared
225 signals, thanks to the decomposition through CWT, but lacks a global view of the trends and their
226 relative shifts over time. Thus, in order to give a synthetic and unique indicator of the similarity
                                                                        9

228 correlation sequence.

230 Time lag estimation through cross-correlation analysis
231           In signal processing, another way to determine the similarity of two discrete time sequences
232 is the cross-correlation. Indeed, since cross-correlation measures the relation between a vector x and
233 time-shifted (lagged) copies of another vector y as a function of the lag itself, it allows also a time-
234 delay analysis between the signals. Moreover, by revealing their relative displacement in time, the
235 lag at which there is the maximum correlation can be considered as the time shift necessary to align
236 the series x and y by sliding y backward (negative lag, in case y has a delay compared to x) or
237 forward (positive lag, in case y displays an anticipation respect to x). To this aim, we computed the
238 cross-correlation function between the time series, at different lags. The lag with the maximum
239 cross-correlation value was thus identified as the “typical time delay” leading the lagged signal.
240           A 90% confidence interval was computed both for the cross-correlation values and for the
241 lag corresponding to the cross-correlation function peak, i.e. for the days of delay. We used two
242 different methods to calculate the interval estimation in order to compare parametric and non-
243 parametric estimates: 1) a Fisher’s z statistics through the Fisher’s z-transformation [26]; 2) a Monte
244 Carlo method through a surrogate time series with the same auto-correlation of the original one, for
245 1,000 simulations [27]. Details and notes on these two confidence interval computation methods are
246 provided in the Supplementary material.
247           Cross-correlation could also be estimated using wavelets, specifically through a maximal
248 overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT): it would have been our intention to complete the
249 analysis with wavelets, but since emergency calls time series are made up of few samples, there are
250 not enough non-boundary coefficients, even at the first level, to compute the wavelet cross-

260 Wavelet analysis
261           As already pointed out before, the following daily regional aggregated data were considered:
262    toll-free number incoming calls,
263    NUE-112 incoming calls,
264    SOREU-118 incoming calls.
265 In addition, we compared also Twitter data to the number of regional daily infected patients.
266           The WCS and the MSWC were calculated for each of these time series in relation to the data
267 of regional daily infected. Indeed, both wavelet cross-power spectrum and coherence, through the
268 CWT, can show areas in the time-frequency space where two signals share common harmonic
269 components. In particular, the focus will be on the areas for which coherence is higher than 0.5
270 (indicated by the arrows, see Figs 1-7), since for lower values of coherence the phase lag is not
271 reliable.
272           In the following figures (Figs 1-7), the time courses of the smoothed and normalized series
273 are displayed on the left, whereas the WCS/MSWC representation is on the right. In the time
274 courses charts, the daily infected curve is in red, while the potential predictor curve is in blue. In the
275 WCS/MSWC charts, the x axis represents time (days), the y axis (logarithmic scale) represents scale
                                                                        11

277 represents the MSWC. The cone of influence, where edge effects should be considered, is shown as
278 a white dashed line. For areas where the coherence exceeds 0.5, the charts display arrows to show
279 the phase lag between the two signals. The arrows, which do not represent vectors since the length
280 is not proportional to the intensity, are spaced in time and scale. The direction of the arrows
281 designates the relative phase on the unit circle: a rightward-pointing arrow indicates in-phase
282 coherence relationship of the two signals (                             ; a leftward-pointing arrow indicates anti-phase
283 coherence relationship (                        . The corresponding lag in time depends on the duration of the
284 cycle (period).

321           Looking at the time courses, it is evident a large anticipation (about two weeks) of the
322 emergency calls trends with respect to the epidemic dynamics: if we consider the peaks of the
323 curves, indeed, while the infected time series reaches its maximum at day 29, the toll-free number
324 and SOREU calls peak occur at day 15 (time delay -14 days), and the NUE calls curve reaches the
325 peak at day 16 (time delay -13 days). However, wavelet analysis does not reveal any strong
326 coherence for all these pair of signals: specifically, among all the previously mentioned time series,
                                                                        13

327 the only one for which wavelet analysis does not display any relevant coherence compared to daily
328 new cases data is that of regional toll-free number incoming calls (Fig 1). Instead, NUE regional
329 data and daily infected signals (Fig 2) display coherence over days from 18 to 22 at frequencies
330 around 0.25 cycles/day, with a phase lag from -126.4° to -134.7°, corresponding to a time delay
331 from 2.5 days to 2.6 days. Interestingly, days from 18 to 22 are confined between the two peaks,
332 since the NUE calls curve reaches the peak at day 16, while the infected curve reaches its maximum
333 at day 29. Not surprisingly, wavelet cross-spectrum and coherence analysis between regional daily
334 incoming calls to SOREU and infected people (Fig 3) shows an anomaly less limited over time and
335 over scale (frequency band ranging from 0.25 cycles/day to 0.37 cycles/day, time interval from day
336 17 to day 28), with a phase shift between -72.1° and -111.2°, leading to a time delay of about 2.4
337 days.
338        Even if not geolocalized, we finally compared regional epidemic time series with Twitter data
339 (Figs 4–7): just considering the time courses, it is evident that the best potential predictor is the
340 tweets time series (peaks at day 22 and day 29, respectively for daily number of tweets and infected
341 curve). Indeed, since replies, likes and retweets are variables dependent on the original tweets, they
342 are delayed in time: likes and retweets reach the peak at day 28, just one day before new cases,
343 loosing almost all the anticipation capability, while the maximum value of replies is achieved even
344 later than the peak of the infected curve, at day 33. Wavelet analysis, focused on the predictability,
345 confirms this consideration:
346    in the case of daily tweets (Fig 4) it detects two relevant areas of high coherence in the time-
347     frequency plane:
348           o a trend at the lowest frequencies (from 0.02 cycles/day to 0.03 cycles/day), with the
349               phase relationship shifting from in-phase coherence to a maximum lag of 31.8° (time
350               delay 2.6 days),
                                                                        14

351           o and a time-localized anomaly before the infected peak around the frequency of 0.25
352               cycles/day, with a phase-lag ranging from 73.0° (day 20, 0.37 cycles/day) to 116.3° (day
353               27, 0.23 cycles/day) and a subsequent time delay between 0.5 and 1.4 days;
354    for the number of daily likes (Fig 5) just a trend localized in the first half of the observation
355     period and at the lowest frequencies is captured, with a maximum phase lag of 65.3° at 0.06
356     cycles/day, corresponding to a time shift of 3.0 days;
357    daily number of retweets (Fig 6) display a similar trend more localized in the frequencies
358     domain (from 0.04 cycles/day to 0.08 cycles/day), with a phase shift always near 0° (in the
359     range between -26.7° and 19.6°);
360    finally, the replies time series (Fig 7) shows a background even more localized both in time and
361     frequency, and an anomaly around the frequency of 0.14 cycles/day from day 19 to day 33, both
362     with a coherence value around 0.6.

375           It is evident that, concerning the dynamics of communications and the context on social
376 media, Twitter activity (Figs 8–9) is not so strictly related to the epidemic dynamics, since it is
377 triggered most of all by social, political and chronicle news, which drive an emotional participation
378 of the users. Indeed, the first increase in all these time series (tweets, replies, likes and retweets),
379 from day -3 to day 1, precedes just the establishment of the red areas in Codogno and Vo’ Euganeo,
380 while the second peak of daily tweets (Fig 8) at day 20 is related to the death of an operator of SRA
381 due to CoViD-19. Moreover, likes and retweets (Fig 9) trends look more aligned to the
382 announcements about lockdown policies.
383
384 Cross-correlation and time delay analysis
385           While wavelet decomposition allows a detailed analysis in both the time and frequency
386 domains, it lacks a unique, global indication of the shift over time between two signals: to this aim,
387 we performed also a time delay analysis estimating the cross-correlation sequence for each pair of
388 time series. This analysis has been conducted only for the three cases for which WCS/MSWC
389 revealed a strong coherence in the ascending phase (before both the peaks or between them), which
390 is the most important from a public health monitoring point of view. These time series are the
391 following: (i) daily regional incoming calls to NUE-112 (Fig 10); (ii) daily regional incoming calls
392 to SOREU-118 (Fig 11); (iii) daily number of new tweets (Fig 12). In the following figures, the
393 maximum of each function is depicted in red, and the confidence limits for the peak lag, deduced by
394 the 90% z-Fisher confidence bounds of the cross-correlation values, are reported below the figures,
395 in the caption. Negative lags denote by how many days the time series of infected patients should be
396 shifted backward over time to be “aligned” with the predictor.

445 Discussion
446
447           Lombardy region has been the epicentre of the CoViD-19 epidemic in the Western
448 Countries [28]. After the detection of the first case, on February the 20th, national and regional
449 health authorities put in place several strategies to limit the spread of the infection and deal with the
450 consequences of the increasing number of cases [29-31]. Indicators that can reveal and anticipate a
451 rise of cases are of paramount importance to support the planning and interventions of the health
452 service organization. Our study shows that the number of calls to emergency services could be a
453 good indicator that can anticipate the need for hospitalization. However, some considerations about
454 the analysis we conducted seem to be appropriate. With respect to wavelet analysis, wavelet
455 decomposition in the time-scale plane has the advantage of giving a huge, precise and detailed
456 amount of information both about time localization and frequency components. Nonetheless, this
457 kind of analysis has also some limitations. First of all, time and frequency resolutions, according to
458 uncertainty Heisenberg principle, are inversely proportional. Secondly, the edge effects affect the
459 reliability of the results in the time-scale plane outside the cone of influence (see Supplementary
460 material for an explanation), so that for the lowest frequencies the time interval with reliable results
461 is very short. Lastly, one must consider also the band-pass filtering action of the CWT: indeed, the
462 frequency spectrum bounds are a function of the number of samples of the signal (see
463 Supplementary material for a detailed explanation), so the availability of data over time could
464 represents a limitation for this kind of analysis. In our specific instance, it can be noticed that the
465 inferior limit of the frequency domain in the case of Twitter data is much lower than the one of the
466 daily regional emergency calls time series (112, 118, toll-free number), just because much more
467 samples for the Twitter data are available (Figs 1-7). Consequently, in the cases of the calls to the
468 emergency services, the ability of wavelet decomposition in revealing hidden signals and trends at
469 the lowest frequencies is limited by the poor number of collected data. This limitation also affects
                                                                        19

470 the WCS/MSWC computation and the possibility of detecting large time delays between the
471 signals. This occurs because the lowest frequencies are cut off by the wavelet band-pass filter, so
472 the duration of a cycle corresponding to the inferior limit of the frequency spectrum (i.e. the longest
473 period of the band) is shorter than the time delay between the two signals. Thus, the large
474 anticipation in the ascending phase evident from the time courses (see in the results the delays
475 between the peak days) cannot be captured by WCS/MSWC. A future perspective would be to
476 obtain and analyze a more complete set of data over the time scale: as already explained, with a
477 greater number of samples, indeed, the minimum spectrum frequency gets lower, the corresponding
478 duration of a cycle (i.e. the maximum period) increases and consequently wavelet analysis through
479 CWT could be able to detect larger time delays between the signals. Moreover, even if aggregated
480 regional data allow us to capture the “sum” of the effects of different local situations with probable
481 a greater anticipation capability, if we consider the enormous geographical heterogeneity of CoViD-
482 19 spread, regional data possess a limited usefulness for public health monitoring and preparedness
483 with respect to a possible second wave of the epidemic. One more future direction would be to
484 analyze these data at a more local level, such as for each SOREU and each province (NUTS-3
485 level), or even municipalities, of Lombardy region. To supply the lack of generality of wavelet
486 analysis, we performed also a time lag analysis through the cross-correlation function. Once again,
487 the limited number of data affected our results: indeed, while the peaks of the emergency calls
488 anticipated that of daily new cases by about two weeks (Figs 2-3), the delay of the cross-correlation
489 function peak is much lower both for NUE calls (-3 days and -4 days, respectively for the original
490 data and the modelled time series, see Figs 10 and 13) and for SOREU calls (-5 days and -6 days,
491 respectively for the original data and the surrogate time series, see Figs 11 and 14). This can be
492 explained just looking at the time courses (Figs 2-3): the availability of emergency calls data is such
493 that we can observe a great part of the descending phase, whereas for the infected curve an initial
494 decrease is visible only during the last days of the corresponding observation period. With this
495 perspective, consequently, it would be useful to analyze a more complete dataset. Several other
                                                                        20

496 indicators are currently under investigation and many of them will provide useful information, but
497 we should not only rely on indicators focused on detecting an increase in new cases, because the
498 main impact on the health system is more related to the characteristics of the infected population
499 rather than to the number of infected people.
500           The severe countermeasures put in place, such as the national lockdown, had a deep impact
501 on the population from several points of view, not only on the health system. It is therefore
502 important to take into account the social reaction to the crisis and analyzing it is part of the public
503 health response. Our analysis shows that Twitter trends correlate more with social factors rather
504 than with the number of cases (Figs 8-9). This finding suggests that a thorough analysis of social
505 media would improve our understanding about what the most common worries, fears and feelings
506 of the population are, in order to address them through a public health strategy that should include a
507 proper use of social media to inform the population. Among all the Twitter data, only the daily
508 number of new tweets reveals some anticipation capability with respect to the epidemic curve:
509 wavelet analysis, indeed, detects a trend at the lowest frequencies, and a phase-lagged anomaly in a
510 frequency range centred around 0.25 cycles/day that occurs just between the two peaks (Fig 4). This
511 finding is confirmed and consistent both with the 7-days distance of the two curve peaks and with
512 the cross-correlation analysis (maximum at -6 days and -3 days lags, respectively for the original
513 data and the modelled time series, with small confidence intervals, see Figs 12 and 15).
