41     Abstract
42
43     Background
44     In 2017, the World Health Organization declared the snakebite envenomation as a
45     neglected tropical disease. Annually, snakebite envenomation causes approximately
46     400,000 permanent disabilities and 95,000 deaths worldwide. People with the greatest
47     risk of envenomation lack access to adequate health care, including treatment with
48     antivenom. We developed an analysis of accessibility to antivenom in Brazil in order to
49     verify the impacts on mortality.
50
51     Methods and Findings
52     Information about number of accidents, deaths, antivenom, medical assistance, and
53     species, were retrieved from the Brazilian Health Informatics Department (DATASUS)
54     from 2010 to 2015 and analyzed using geostatistics to evaluate the association between
55     snakebite accidents and mortality. An Spatial analysis using Global Moran’s I was
56     performed in order to verify the presence of spatiality as an independent variable to the
57     distribution of the accidents. In addition, we also tested three different analysis of
58     regression using Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Spatial Error, and Geographically
59     Weighed Regression (GWR), together with the information obtained from the DATASUS
60     and sociodemographic indicators, to verify the spatial-temporal distribution of
61     envenomation cases and time to reach the healthcare centers. The regression
62     presenting the lowest Akaike Criterion Information (AIC), highest adjusted R², and
63     variables with p < 0.05 was selected to represent our model. Lastly, the accessibility
64     index was performed using 2-step floating catchment area based on the amount of
65     hospital beds and inhabitants. This study revealed 141,039 cases of snakebites, 598
66     deaths, and mortality rate of 3.13 per 1,000,000 inhabitants. Moreover, GWR presented
67     the best fit (AIC = 55477.56; adjusted R² = 0.55) and showed that illiteracy, income,
68     percentage of urban population, percentage of antivenom, accessibility index for
69     hospital beds with antivenom, proportion of cases with more than 3 hours to reach
70     healthcare are correlated with the mortality rate by snakebite (p < 0.05).
71
72     Conclusion
73     This study identified regions affected by snakebite and how the accessibility to
74     antivenom treatment plays an important role in the mortality in Brazil. Public
75     interventions can located to those most vulnerable regions in order to improve the
76     accident outcome.

 81     Introduction
 82
 83               Snake envenomation is a neglected tropical disease of global importance (1).
 84     Estimations around the world are between 1.2 and 5.5 million bites, 421,000
 85     envenomations, 20,000-95,000 deaths, and 400,000 permanent disabilities annually (2).
 86     The morbidity and mortality related to this disease primarily impacts resource-limited
 87     countries as well as those with lower income earning and other socioeconomic
 88     indicators of poverty (3).
 89               In Brazil between 2001 and 2012, 1,192,667 incidents and 2,664 deaths resulting
 90     from terrestrial venomous animals (snakes, scorpions, bees, spiders, and caterpillars)
 91     were reported. Of these, 28% of all incidences and 54% of deaths were attributed to
 92     snake envenomation (4). Of the reported snakebites, 70% of them were from the
 93     Bothrops genus. Bothrops envenomation can cause many clinically significant effects
 94     from local swelling and bleeding to muscle necrosis, acute kidney injury and cerebral
 95     hemorrhage (5) (6). Thus, it becomes important for victims to reach health assistance in
 96     time.
 97               Access to snake-specific antivenom is limited because of expensive
 98     manufacturing and long transport time to healthcare facility (7). Feitosa et al. 2015
 99     found delays in healthcare access in the Amazon is associated with greater severity and
100     mortality related to snake envenomation (8). Additionally, socioeconomic inequalities
101     have also been linked with lower access health care (9). There is substantial research
102     on the uneven distribution of health care facilities in Brazil (10). However, there is no
103     analysis on accessibility to healthcare and its impacts on snakebite mortality rates in
104     Brazil. Besides, it has not yet been reported how social inequalities are associated with
105     snakebite outcomes.
106               Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyze the accessibility to antivenom taking
107     into the account the sociodemographics indicators in Brazil in order to verify its impacts
108     on snakebite envenomation mortality using spatial analysis.
109
110     Methods
111     Study Design
112               This study used cross-sectional data on country-wide snakebite envenomations
113     from 2010 to 2015 from National System Identification of Notifiable Diseases (SINAN)
114     stored at DATASUS. We conducted an exploratory spatial analysis to evaluate the
115     geospatial association of snake envenomation mortality in Brazil with socioeconomic
116     predictors (illiteracy, income, percentage of urban area, and human development
117     index), and healthcare access predictors (number of beds, hospitals and health
118     professionals, quantity of antivenom administrated, antivenom coverage, and time to
119     reach the healthcare centers).

121     Study population and location
122               Brazil has a population of 190,732,694 people distributed to 5 regions (North,
123     Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and South) (Figure 1)(11). In recent years, the Brazilian
124     economy has grown rapidly, and the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) is
125     currently the ninth largest globally (9). Brazil has also faced an economic and political
126     crisis since 2010. Despite the growth in the recent years, not all segments of the
127     Brazilian population have benefited uniformly from this rapid development, resulting in
128     substantial income inequality within and between regions of the country, as depicted in
129     Figure 1 (9).

136
137     Data extraction
138               Data regardless sociodemographic indicators were extracted from the Brazilian
139     Institute of Geography and Statistic 2010 Census (11), while information about
140     healthcare centers were obtained from DATASUS and the National Register of Health
141     Facilities (CNES).
142
143     Snakebite envenomation data
144               The number of envenomations, hospitalizations from envenomations, deaths
145     from envenomations, time to reach healthcare centers and number of envenomations
146     that were treated with antivenom were collected from SINAN (12). Snakebite outcomes

147     included: mortality, systemic and local complications. An aggregate indicator for
148     snakebite negative outcomes was generated by a sum of the municipality level mortality
149     and complications. Snakebite specific healthcare indicators were: proportion of cases
150     notified more than 3 hours to reach healthcare assistance, and proportions of cases
151     with notified antivenom usage.
152
153     Data analysis
154               All analyses in this study were conducted at the municipality-level. Snakebite
155     frequency and complications, socioeconomic indicators and healthcare access were
156     summarized using descriptive statistics.
157
158     Availability of care in hospitals with antivenom
159               We calculated the availability of hospitals with antivenom by mapping the
160     facilities that received antivenom obtained from the Butantã Institute, agency
161     responsible for producing and distributing antivenom across the country. To evaluate
162     the accessibility to hospitals with antivenom, we used the two-step floating catchment
163     area (2SFCA) method (13). The 2SFCA creates an index of hospitals with antivenom
164     weighted by population in two concurrent steps. In the first step, a buffer was created
165     with a Euclidean 120 kilometer (km) radius surrounding each hospital with antivenom.
166     This buffer was created to collect the population potentially covered in all locations (k)
167     within the threshold. The 120 km range limit was used to estimate a travel distance of
168     two hours to the nearest hospital by car or public transport. The second step consists of
169     summing up the initial ratios in overlapped service areas to measure accessibility for a
170     demand location, where residents have access to multiple supply locations. These
171     steps produced an accessibility index of hospital bed availability with antivenom for
172     each municipality. A higher accessibility index indicates more hospital bed available with
173     antivenom for a given municipality.
174
175     Spatial regression
176               The Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Spatial Error and geographically weighted
177     regression (GWR) were used to verify the regression with the best fit capable to
178     elucidate the correlation between sociodemographic and healthcare indicators with the
179     mortality rates by snakebite. The regression with the highest adjusted R², lowest AIC,
180     and significant variables (p < 0.05) was chosen as the main model for the study. The
181     spatial autocorrelation and the OLS model were processed using GeoDa software
182     version 1.10.0.8 (Laboratory of Spatial Analysis, University of Illinois at Urbana-
183     Champaign, Urbana, USA). The GWR model was calculated and implemented using R
184     Studio. The maps were generated using QGIS version 2.14.23.

190     Results
191
192               Between 2010 and 2015, there were a total of 141,039 reported cases of snake
193     envenomation. 598 resulted in death and 27,047 had systemic complications from
194     envenomation. The most frequent cases occurred in the North region (50,102 bites),
195     followed by Southeast (32,474 bites), and least was the South region (12,130 bites).
196     The North region was also in the lead regions with deaths, followed by the Northeast,
197     similar pattern observed to Systemic and Local complications (Table 1).
198               According to the registry, the majority of snakebite envenomation received
199     antivenom at some point during their care trajectory. However, the North, Northeast and
200     Midwest had higher proportion of cases with more than 3 hours to reach healthcare
201     (Table 1). Similarly, these were the same regions with lower number of hospitals with
202     lower scores for accessibility for antivenom per population.

240     Discussion
241
242               This study is the first nationwide analysis that evaluates the geospatial impact of
243     access to healthcare and antivenom on snakebite mortality. We found a heterogeneous
244     distribution of snakebite mortality and accessibility to healthcare. This is probably
245     attributed to Brazil's continental dimensions where there are several costumes and
246     cultures (14, 15).
247               However, the results showed that mortality particularly affected rural and
248     underdeveloped regions of the country. This geographical disparity is corroborated by
249     some studies that revealed that snakebite is a poverty disease and its mortality is
250     correlated with the workforce in agriculture (3, 16). Additionally, the GWR also showed
251     that low illiteracy, income, and percentage of urban area are related to the increased
252     snakebite mortality. Similar study conducted by Suraweera et al (2020) in India also
253     verified that these indicators are correlated with snakebite mortality (17).
254               Access to antivenom in Brazil varied across the nation with metropolitan areas in
255     the South and Southeast having abundant access compared to the Northwest. Reduced
256     access to antivenom in the North is associated with higher rates of mortality in our
257     study. These are well supplied with antivenom as informed by some studies (18, 19),
258     but the mortality stands out because of the difficulties to reach the healthcare centers,
259     mostly because the main means of locomotion in the amazon is by fluvial transport (20).
260     In addition, those patients that managed to reach healthcare assistance beyond 3 hours
261     were significantly higher in the north suggesting the struggles with the transport.
262               As for the majority of patients in the country, it was capable to look for health
263     assistance in 3 hours. Our finding is also consistent with findings in Costa Rica where
264     the majority of care received was within 2 hours, even in mountainous and rural regions
265     or other areas with high snakebite incidence. (21)
266
267     Limitations
268               First, although SINAN is intended to be a nationally comprehensive and accurate
269     database on important notifiable diseases, SINAN is as susceptible as other large
270     population-level databases to reliability and consistency of data collection. Additionally,
271     provider-level reporting of snakebites relies on accurate recognition and diagnosis.
272     Thus, underreporting may not capture the whole scope of this important neglected
273     tropical disease. Second, using a 120km radius to define the catchment area of public
274     hospitals may not be uniform considering rainforest or rural areas cover 60% of Brazil.
275     Despite these limitations, our findings are to our knowledge one of the first studies
276     highlighting the geographical variability of mortality snake envenomations in association
277     with access to antivenom and healthcare.

280     Conclusion
281               In Brazil low illiteracy, income, percentage of urban area, and accessibility to
282     antivenom and healthcare centers are related to the increasing of snakebite mortality.
283     It’s noteworthy to mention that this paper provides regions that lack in those indicators
284     and might useful for the development of better public actions in order to obtain more
285     favorable outcomes.
