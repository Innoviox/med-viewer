33   Tracing the globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 mutants is essential for the outbreak alerts and
34   far-reaching epidemiological surveillance. The available technique to identify the phylogenetic
35   clades through high-throughput sequencing is costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive that
36   hinders the viral genotyping in low-income countries. Here, we propose a rapid, simple and
37   cost-effective amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS)-based multiplex reverse-
38   transcriptase PCR assay to identify six distinct phylogenetic clades: S, L, V, G, GH, and GR.
39   This approach is applied on 24 COVID-19 positive samples as confirmed by CDC approved
40   real-time PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2. Our multiplex PCR is designed in a mutually exclusive
41   way to identify V-S and G-GH-GR clade variants separately. The pentaplex assay included all
42   five variants and the quadruplex comprised of the triplex variants alongside either V or S clade
43   mutations that created two separate subsets. The procedure was optimized in the primer
44   concentration (0.2-0.6 µM) and annealing temperature (56-60°C) of PCR using 3-5 ng/µl
45   cDNA template synthesized upon random- and oligo(dT)-primer based reverse transcription.
46   The different primer concentration for the triplex and quadruplex adjusted to different strengths
47   ensured an even amplification with a maximum resolution of all targeted amplicons. The
48   targeted Sanger sequencing further confirmed the presence of the clade-featured mutations with
49   another set of our designed primers. This multiplex ARMS-PCR assay is sample, cost-
50   effective, and convenient that can successfully discriminate the circulating phylogenetic clades
51   of SARS-CoV-2.

65   Introduction
66   SARS-CoV-2 has spread across 188 countries/regions within the first six months of COVID-
67   19 pandemic infecting more than 354 million people (Dong, Du, & Gardner, 2020). This highly
68   infectious virus poses a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of nearly 30 kbp
69   (Mousavizadeh & Ghasemi, 2020). Both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations were
70   identified in the genomic region that code for non-structural proteins (NSP1-16), structural
71   proteins (spike, membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid proteins), and/or seven other accessory
72   proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8a, ORF8b, ORF8, and ORF10) (M. R. Islam
73   et al., 2020; Kamitani, 2020; Liu, Fung, Chong, Shukla, & Hilgenfeld, 2014; Ou et al., 2020).
74   Researchers have demonstrated that the predominant mutations may attribute to virulence
75   (Alam, Islam, Hasan, et al., 2020; Rahman et al., 2020; Q. Wang et al., 2020). The virus has
76   been classified into six clades namely GH, GR, G, V, L, and S by the global initiative on sharing
77   all influenza data (GISAID) (Shu & McCauley, 2017) by the clustered, co-evolving, and clade-
78   featured point mutations.
79   The mutations at position C241T along with C3037T, C14408T (RdRp:p.P323L), and
80   A23403G (S:p.D614G) was referred as G clade. Additional mutation to the G clade at N
81   protein:p.RG203-204KR (GGG28881-28883AAC) and ORF3a:p.Q57H (G25563T) refers to
82   GR and GH clade, respectively. The V clade was classified by co-evolving mutations at
83   G11083T (NSP6:p.L37F) and G26144T (ORF3a:p.G251V) where S clade strains contain
84   C8782T and T28144C (NS8:p.L84S) variations, respectively. The L clade strains are the
85   original or wild version for the featured mutations of five clades (Mercatelli & Giorgi, 2020).
86   Previous studies showed the prevalence of phylogenetic clades were different by regions and
87   times and were closely related to variable death-case ratio (Alam et al., 2020; Toyoshima et al
88   2020, nature). G clade variant was dominant in Europe (Korber et al., 2020) and USA (Brufsky,
89   2020) on the eve of pandemic which caused high mortality in USA. This mutation variant has
90   gradually been circulated in Southeast Asia (Alam et al., 2020; Islam et al., 2020) and Oceania
91   (Mercatelli & Giorgi, 2020). On the contrary GR and GH clades were emerged at the end of
92   February 2020 and GR mutant are now the leading type that cause more than one-third of
93   infection globally (Mercatelli & Giorgi, 2020). Therefore, it is indispensable to identify the
94   circulating clades in a specific region. Besides, several reports speculated the occurrence of
95   SARS-CoV-2 reinfection by phylogenetically different strains that belongs to separate clades
96   (Li et al., 2020; To et al., 2020). The dominance of a particular viral clade over others might
97   determine the virulence, disease severity, and infection dynamics (Alam et al., 2020). However,
                                                                                                                                     3

 98   the implications of different clades on effective drug and vaccine development is yet to be
 99   clearly elucidated (Chellapandi & Saranya, 2020).
100   The identification of phylogenetic clades requires the identification of specific mutations into
101   viral genome. This identification is performed by the whole genome sequence through NGS
102   technique that has now scaled up the deposited sequences number in GISAID to 139,000 as of
103   October 6, 2020. Another high-throughput NGS alternative is based on clade-based genetic
104   barcoding that targets PCR amplicons encompassing the featured mutation as described by
105   Guan et al. (2020). However, this state of art technique has limited access to most laboratories
106   in low-income countries. A short-throughput and small-scale genotyping would be the Sanger
107   based targeted sequencing approach (Alam, Islam, Rahman, Islam, & Hossain, 2020), but this
108   is labor intensive, time-consuming, inconvenient, and difficult to perform at low cost.
109   Therefore, we have hardly observed the worldwide distribution of circulating clades in many
110   countries, like Afghanistan, Maldives, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Ethiopia, Sudan, Zimbabwe,
111   Bolivia, Paraguay, and Chile, most probably due to the lack of sequencing facilities and
112   appropriate technical personnel to perform this state-of-the-art technique. PCR-based point
113   mutation discriminating technique, which is also known as the amplified refractory mutation
114   system (ARMS), has been proven to be useful in identifying subtypes or clades of other
115   respiratory viruses previously (Brister, Barnum, Reedy, Chambers, & Pusterla, 2019; Lee,
116   Kim, Shin, & Song, 2016; W. Wang et al., 2009). In this study, we aimed to develop and
117   validate an ARMS-based novel multiplex-PCR to identify the clade-specific point mutations
118   of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 clades.
119   Methods and materials
120   Sample collection and cDNA preparation
121   Nasal and oral samples were collected in the health care facilities in the south-west part of
122   Bangladesh and sent to the genome center, Jashore University of Science and Technology,
123   Bangladesh. RNA was extracted from those samples using nucleic acid extraction kit,
124   Invitrogen inc. The extracted RNA was then tested for SARS CoV-2 using a commercial kit
125   from Sansure Biotceh Co., Ltd (China). The left-over RNA were preserved at -40°C in the
126   genome center lab. A total of 24 randomly selected SARS CoV-2 positive samples were tested
127   for the analysis (supplementary Table s1). A representative SARS CoV-2 negative sample
128   (of 5 of the negative samples randomly selected) was used as a negative control in this study
129   (supplementary Table s2). cDNA was prepared for each selected sample using the GoScript™
                                                                                                                                      4

130   Reverse Transcription System (Promega, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. In
131   brief, primer/ RNA mix was prepared by mixing 10µl of extracted RNA with 1µl of Random
132   primer and 1µl of Oligo(dT)15 primer (total volume 12µl). Then the mixture was heated at 70°C
133   for 5 minutes, followed by immediate chilling on ice for 5 minutes and a quick spin. The
134   mixture for reverse transcription reaction was prepared by making a cocktail of the components
135   from GoScript™ Reverse Transcription System in a sterile 1.5ml micro centrifuge tube keeping
136   on ice. The final reaction mix was 40μl for each cDNA synthesis reaction to be performed.
137   Design and in silico validation of variant-specific (3′-SNP) multiplex primers
138   A set of 15 primers (Table 1) was designed based on the ARMS for differentiating six major
139   clades of SARS-CoV-2: S, L, V, G, GH, and GR. We designated here the L clade strains as the
140   wild type and others as mutants. For each clade apart from L, we selected a single representative
141   SNP variant, including 23403 A>G (p.D614G), 25563 G>T (p.Q57H), 28882 G>A (p.R203K),
142   26144 G>T (p.G251V) and 28144 T>C (p.L84S) from the multiple co-evolving mutations of
143   the clades (G, GH, GR, V and S, respectively). For example, the S clade is deviated from the
144   L clade by two mutations: C8782T, T28144C. The ‘T’ or ‘C’ at 28144 positions was rendered
145   as wild (L clade) or mutant type variant (indicating S clade), respectively. Details of other
146   clade-specific mutations can be derived from the GISAID site and this literature. As established
147   for ARMS technique, this specificity was directed towards the 3′-end of the annealed primer-
148   template (Fig. 1). The forward or reverse type-specific primers were paired with counterpart
149   reverse or forward primer. The amplicons were simultaneously distinguished by their
150   molecular weight (bp) in multiplex PCR in different combinations. The positive amplification
151   of wild type targeting primers was determined as the L type. The other types were determined
152   based on the co-evolving mutation at respective sites.
153   The primer sets were designed using Primer3Plus (Untergasser et al., 2012) and Primer-
154   BLAST (Ye et al., 2012) with the following stringent parameters and standard PCR conditions:
155   avoiding hypothetical primer dimer (self or hetero) formation with less than -9 Kcal/mol, sized
156   18-22 nucleotide in length, Tm of (58-60)°C, (40-60)% GC content, G/C within the last five
157   bases, no repeat of four or more of any base, amplicon size ranging from 200 to 600 bp, and
158   avoiding hairpin loop structure. The primer specificity against SARS-CoV-2 and other
159   organisms was checked by the Primer-BLAST. We performed the in silico PCR with the
160   primers in the UCSC genome browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/). Finally, the primer set was
161   synthesized from the IDT company (https://www.idtdna.com/).
                                                                                                                                      5

162   Standardization of annealing temperature for Single-variant specific PCRs
163   A gradient PCR (SimpliAmp Thermal Cycler, Applied Biosystems, USA) was performed for
164   each of the variant separately with freshly prepared cDNA template to standardize the
165   annealing temperature. Couple of distinct tubes was prepared for each of the variant using the
166   respective primer pairs to differentiate between the wild type and the mutant. The PCR was
167   carried out in 10µl reaction volume containing 3-5 ng/µl DNA, 5µl master mixture (GoTaq®
168   G2 Green Master; Promega, USA), 0.2µM of each forward and reverse primer and 2.8 µl
169   nuclease free water. The thermocycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C
170   for 1 min followed by 30 cycles at 95°C for 30s, annealing at a range of 55-65°C for 30s and
171   72°C for 30s followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5min. The PCR products were
172   electrophoresed on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide (UltraPure™
173   Ethidium Bromide, 10 mg/mL; Thermo Fisher, USA) and visualized using a gel documentation
174   system (Bio-Rad, USA).
175   Multiplex PCR assays for simultaneous identification of the variants
176   Four sets (duplex, triplex, quadruplex and pentaplex) of multiple variant-specific reactions
177   were arranged for simultaneous detection of a clade. A duplex PCR was performed by using a
178   mix of 26144 G>T(p.G251V) and 28144 T>C (p.L84S) variant specific primer pairs viz.
179   NS3_26144_F-NS3_26144_wR (wild type)/NS3_26144_F-NS3_26144_mR (mutant) and
180   NS8_28144_F-NS8_28144_wR (wild type)/ NS8_28144_F-NS8_28144_mR (mutant),
181   respectively while mixing for wild types and the mutants in separate PCR tubes. A triplex PCR
182   assay was performed by using a blend of primer pairs viz. S_23403_wF-S_23403_R (wild type
183   primers)/ S_23403_mF- S_23403_R (mutant primers), NS3_25563_w1F-NS3_25563_1R
184   (wild type primers)/ NS3_25563_m1F-NS3_25563_1R                                          (mutant), and N_28882_F-
185   N_28882_wR (wild type)/ N_28882_F-N_28882_mR specific to 23403 A>G (p.D614G),
186   25563 G>T (p.Q57H) and 28882 G>A (p.R203K) SNP variants respectively. Quadruplex and
187   pentaplex PCR assays were further performed in similar manner. The pentaplex consisted the
188   mix for all five SNP variants, On the other hand, the quadruplex contained the variants of
189   triplex plus either 26144 G>T (p.G251V) or 28144 T>C (p.L84S), thus making two different
190   subsets. Among the 24 samples, one was used as a representative of all sets of multiplexes and
191   reproducibility (described in more detail below) was checked over the rest of the samples.

193   The multiplex PCR assays were performed over all the 24 positive samples. To validate the
194   reliability of the assays, another five pairs of primer set (Table 2) were designed for the clades
195   keeping the probable mutation points within the middle of the amplicons by using Primer3Plus
196   (Untergasser et al., 2012) and Primer-BLAST (Ye et al., 2012). Above mentioned parameter
197   settings were followed to design those (except for the amplicon size ranging from 200-400bp
198   and Tm of 52-54°C). Amplicons were subjected to Sanger sequencing using BigDye™
199   Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) to confirm the specific clades
200   (wild type/mutant). The commercial kit protocol was optimized to reduce the cost because of
201   the high cost of this BigDye Terminator reagent (Platt, Woodhall, & George, 2007). 1.0μL (per
202   10 10μL reaction) undiluted BigDye Terminator v3.1 Ready Reaction mix was used instead of
203   4μL mentioned in commercial kit protocol. Along with the 1.0 μL BigDye Terminator v3.1
204   Ready Reaction mix, 1.75 μL 5x sequencing buffer, 1μL primer, 2μL template DNA and
205   4.25μL nuclease free water was added (to make the final reaction volume 10μL). The cycle
206   sequencing PCR condition was setup accordingly to the kit protocol. The sequences were
207   aligned with and verified by the reference sequence (NC_045512.2_SARS-CoV-2_Wuhan-
208   Hu-1 complete genome) using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA X) software
209   (Kumar, Stecher, Li, Knyaz, & Tamura, 2018). For the most part, the cost of the processes were
210   optimized and compared to our in-house NGS system (Ion torrent; ThermoFisher Scientific,
211   USA).
212   Prediction of Primer dimer formation and RNA secondary structure
213   We carried out RNA secondary structure prediction of the ORF3a or NS3 RNA using the Mfold
214   web server (Zuker, 2003). The full NS3 sequence was extracted from the SARS-CoV-2
215   reference sequence of NCBI GenBank. The default parameters were used in generating
216   structure. Besides, we used oligoanalyzer v3.1 of integrated DNA technologies (IDT) to
217   examine possible primer duplexes and calculate the primer-dimer (both self and hetero)
218   formation energy in case of the primers, NS3_26144_F, NS3_26144_wR, and
219   NS3_26144_mR, targeting ORF3a multiplexed amplicons. The possibility of dimers and
220   energy values for the targeted primers were checked against other twelve primer sets.

223   ARMS-based PCRs for single SNP variants (singleplex PCRs) were optimized at an annealing
224   temperature of 57°C. The primer pairs for the variants 23403 A>G (p.D614G) and 28882 G>A
225   (p.R203K) amplified the related mutant bands (208bp and 387bp, respectively). On the other
226   hand, the primer pairs designed to denote the variants 25563 G>T (p.Q57H), 26144
227   G>T(p.G251V) and 28144 T>C (p.L84S) had wild type amplicons (279bp, 568bp and 496bp,
228   respectively) (Fig.2 IA-IE). Hence, the single-variant specific PCRs were able to identify the
229   SARS-CoV-2 positive sample containing GR-clade of the virus.
230   Optimization of multiplex PCR assays
231   The singleplex PCRs showed successful annealing at 57°C, however, temperatures for the
232   duplex, triplex and quadruplex assays were needed to be further optimized to 60°C, 57°C and
233   56°C, respectively (Fig.2 IIA-IIE). The primer concentrations for duplex were similar (0.2µM
234   of each primer pair for both the SNP variants) to the single-variant specific PCRs, they were
235   adjusted to different strengths for the triplex (for both forward and reverse primers: 0.2µM for
236   23403 A>G (p.D614G), 0.3µM for 25563 G>T (p.Q57H), and 0.4µM for 28882 G>A
237   (p.R203K)) and the quadruplex (for both forward and reverse primers: 0.4µM for 23403 A>G
238   (p.D614G), 0.3µM for 25563 G>T (p.Q57H), 0.6µM for 28882 G>A (p.R203K) and 0.2µM
239   for 28144 T>C (p.L84S)) to get the maximum possible resolution. The duplex PCR assay
240   simultaneously amplified the desired wild type bands of 568bp and 496bp; the band for 28144
241   T>C (p.L84S) was faint in the duplex setting comparing to the single run of the variant
242   described before. Besides, the triplex PCR also amplified the products as expected (i.e., 208bp,
243   279bp and 387bp). One of the subsets of quadruplex that contained the variants of triplex plus
244   28144C T>C (p.L84S) was able to distinguish the desired bands individually. However,
245   quadruplex (that had 26144 G>T (p.G251V)) and pentaplex arrangement could not
246   discriminate the bands between wild types and mutants (supplementary Fig.s1).
247   Validation of multiplex PCR assays
248   All the 24 positive samples confirmed the test reproducibility of the assays; four of them
249   excluding the one used before for multiplex assays were taken as representative to display the
250   reproducibility in this article (Fig.2 IIIA-IIIC). In this study, only GR clade was found in all
251   positive samples tested. The homology of the nucleotide sequences for the PCR products
252   showed more than 99% identity with the respective positions of the clades that validated the
253   assays (supplementary Fig.s2). Accession IDs to the submitted sequences for one positive

256   Discussion
257   This study proposes a simple and exclusive ARMS-based SNP-discriminating method using
258   conventional PCR to establish multiplex-assays in detecting SARS-CoV-2 mutation clades.
259   This concept was adopted from the other studies applied to identify the genetic profile of
260   respiratory or gastrointestinal coronaviruses of pigs, human cancer risk related SNPs, virus that
261   causes systemic infection in canines, the resistance profile of a bacteria etc. (Chulakasian et al.,
262   2010; Lai, Welter, & Welter, 1995; Shi et al., 2013; C. Zhang et al., 2013). This study designed
263   point-mutation specific primers to detect the six different SARS-CoV-2 clades as described by
264   GISAID. The clade-based discrimination during COVID-19 pandemic was exceedingly
265   important because the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 clades were varied by regions and times,
266   and were closely related to variable death-case ratio (Alam et al., 2020; Toyoshima et al 2020,
267   nature). G clade variant was dominant in Europe (Korber et al., 2020) and USA (Brufsky, 2020)
268   on the beginning of the pandemic that caused high mortality in USA. This mutation variant
269   was gradually circulating in Southeast Asia (Alam, Islam, Hasan, et al., 2020; O. K. Islam et
270   al., 2020) and Oceania (Mercatelli & Giorgi, 2020). Among the two derivative of G clade (GR
271   and GH) that emerged at the end of February 2020, GR mutant are now the leading type that
272   cause more than one-third of infection globally (Mercatelli & Giorgi, 2020).
273   In this study, we attempted to validate two sets of multiplex PCR covering G, GH and GR in
274   the first set, and V and S in the second set. Based on the available data of clade prevalence we
275   propose to run the first set of multiplex PCR in the beginning that can confirm the most three
276   prevalent clades (Alam, Islam, Hasan, et al., 2020). Our attempt for pentaplex and/or the
277   quadruplex (that included the SNP variant 26144 G>T (p.G251V)) was unsuccessful, where
278   the template regarding the variant 26144 G>T (p.G251V) did not amplify, possibly due to
279   primer-dimer formation with higher thermodynamic stability than other variant-specific primer
280   sets. The forward primer could bind to the N_28882_mR primer with a G value of <-7
281   Kcal/mol, but can make longer products ~40 bp. In case of reverse primers that target mutation,
282   only NS3_26144_wR would form a self-dimer with high free energy (-12.9 Kcal/mol). These
283   homo- and hetero-dimer formation would make more primer duplex and might reduce the
284   chance of effective pentaplex PCR. Another possibility could be that the NS3 binding region
285   of the primers (205-222 and 752-772) has resided in a stable stem site hindered the effective
286   annealing. The RNA structure showed the complex stem-loop region and open sites as well.
287   Our targeted primer binding sites for the variant 26144 G>T (p.G251V) were within the stem-
                                                                                                                                      9

288   loop region whereas the primer annealing sites for 25563 G>T (p.Q57H) variant reside within
289   the open region of the template. Here we assume, the complex structural configuration of NS3
290   may block the PCR reaction during a competitive multiplexing (supplementary Fig.s3). A
291   longer RNA denaturation step during cDNA synthesis and more stringent cycle denaturation
292   of cDNA template might solve this issue. However, it could damage low-concentrated, sample-
293   extracted viral RNA and inhibit amplification of other clade-specific templates by affecting
294   overall optimized multiplex condition.
295   The advantage of our ARMS-based multiplex assays is rapid. The turnaround time for our
296   designed assay would range from approximately 3-4 hours for 96 samples. The NGS and
297   Sanger methods, on the other hand, had a turnaround time of more than 24 hours and 10-12
298   hours, respectively (Tsuchihashi & Dracopoli, 2002; J. Zhang et al., 2020). An ARMS based
299   multiplex PCR assay similar to the current study would render a more convenient way to detect
300   clade specific mutation (SNPs) due to the process being faster and cost effective (Ahlawat,
301   Sharma, Maitra, Roy, & Tantia, 2014). The cost of the assay for a single reaction was $7 per
302   run (the cost includes import Tax and VAT etc. for Bangladesh) that is much less than targeted
303   and whole-genome based NGS methods in identifying the clades. The cost will be further
304   reduced if an optimized one-step PCR system is used and we are currently working on it to cut
305   the overall cost down to less than $2. Thus, our method can overcome a serious limitation to
306   effectively identify viral clades with a prospective broader application. The requirement of
307   technical skill would also be low for this assay wherein the training of personnel is a minimal
308   requirement and interpretation of results is generic (Syrmis et al., 2004; L. Wang et al., 2011).
309   Besides, the presence of the template as well as their quantity and quality are determined at the
310   same time. The false-negative result for the absence of a template can also be determined in a
311   facile manner (Edwards & Gibbs, 1994). In general, mutating the primer at its 3’prime end
312   makes it refractory to the ‘wild type template’ whereas the absence of mutation in the primer
313   is retractable to the ‘mutant template’ amending a reliable technique over sequencing
314   (Chulakasian et al., 2010). On the other hand, next generation sequencing technology such as
315   whole genome sequencing (WGS) or metagenomics approach can generate millions of high-
316   throughput data that enabled researchers to unroll new dimensions in the field of genome
317   sequencing applications (El-Metwally, Hamza, Zakaria, & Helmy, 2013). The lack of technical
318   personnel to analyze NGS data is also a reason to prefer alternative approach other than NGS
319   technology in low-income countries. Therefore, the ARMS technology with the conventional
320   multiplex PCR methods in identifying the clades would be more applicable in low and
321   minimum resource settings.

322   Conclusion
323   Our assay can enhance the identification of genotypic variants of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide,
324   especially in low-resource settings where NGS and Sanger sequencing techniques are difficult
325   to reach out. This rapid barcoding method may assist to reveal disease epidemiology, patient
326   management and protein-based drug designing, and also contribute to modify future national
327   policy, and vaccine development. A more cost-effective one-step procedure based on modified
328   tetra ARMS assay (T-ARMS) is under development by our group that will considerably reduce
329   the labor and cost further.

517   variant specific PCRs with the respective amplicons in bp at the bottom of each gel image,
518   showing the variants. (II) Multiplex PCR assays, containing PCR products for different clade
519   combinations: duplex for 26144 G>T (p.G251V) and, 28144 T>C (p.L84S) variants at an
520   annealing temperature of 60°C; triplex for the variants 23403 A>G (p.D614G), 25563 G>T
521   (p.Q57H) and, 28882 G>A (p.R203K) at 57°C; quadruplex for the variants 23403 A>G
522   (p.D614G), 25563 G>T (p.Q57H), 28882 G>A (p.R203K) and, 28144C T>C (p.L84S) at 56°C.
523   SARS-CoV-2 positive sample, GC 46.003 was used as a representative to perform the PCRs
524   for (I) and (II). (III) Validation of the multiplex PCR assays, containing the identical settings
525   for duplex, triplex and quadruplex PCRs with GC 44.201 (denoted as SR-1), GC 88.025
526   (denoted SR-2), GC 90.175 (denoted SR-3) and GC 92.172 (denoted as SR-4) as
527   representatives to display the reproducibility of the assays. SARS-CoV-2 negative sample, GC
528   116.09 was used as (-ve) control for the comparison. ‘GC’ indicates the Genome Center
529   identification number generated at the Genome Center of Jashore University of Science and
530   Technology for COVID-19 suspected patients. WT, wild type band; M, Mutant band. 100-
