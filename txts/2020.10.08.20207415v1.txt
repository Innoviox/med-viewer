Abstract
Background: Cachexia is present in up to 50% of patients with cancer and may contribute to primary resistance
to immunotherapy. Biomarkers to predict cachexia are urgently required for early intervention. Herein, we test
                                                  18
the hypothesis that pre-treatment                   F-FDG-PET/CT-based radiomics can be used to predict cachexia and
subsequently associated with clinical outcomes among patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) who are treated with immunotherapy.
Methods: This retrospective multi-institution study included 210 patients with histologically confirmed stage
IIIB-IV NSCLC who were treated with immune checkpoint blockade between June 2011 and August 2019.
Baseline (pre-immunotherapy) PET/CT images of 175 patients from Moffitt Cancer Center were used to train
(N=123) and test (N=52) a radiomics signature to predict cachexia, which was also used to predict durable
clinical benefit (DCB), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) subsequently. An external cohort
that enrolled 35 patients from James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital (VA) was used to further validate the
predictive and prognostic value of this signature.
Results: A radiomics signature demonstrated cachexia prediction ability with areas under receiver operating
characteristics curves (AUC) of 0.77 (95%CI:0.68-0.85), 0.75 (95%CI:0.60-0.86) and of 0.73 (95%CI:0.53-0.92) in
the training, test and external VA cohorts, respectively. For the further investigation of prognostic value, this
signature could identify the patients with DCB with AUC of 0.67 (95%CI:0.57-0.77), 0.66 (95%CI:0.51-0.81), and
0.72 (95%CI:0.54-0.89) in these three cohorts. Additionally, the PFS and OS were significantly shorter among
patients with higher radiomics signature in all the three cohorts (p<0.05).
Conclusion: Using PET/CT radiomics analysis, cachexia could be predicted before the start of the
immunotherapy, making it possible to monitor the patients with a higher risk of cachexia and identify patients
most likely to benefit from immunotherapy.

Introduction
      Cachexia, a syndrome that induces progressive functional impairment(1), is present in up to 50% patients
with cancer(2), and accounts for 20% of cancer-related deaths(3). Cachexia is defined as more than 5% weight
loss over 6 months, or more than 2% weight loss if body mass index (BMI) is less than 20 kg/m 2 in absence of
simple starvation(4). Compared to other solid neoplasms, such as breast and thyroid cancer, and
haematological malignancies, the prevalence of cachexia is higher in patients with lung cancer(5, 6), which is
one of the most prevalent cancer types and a leading cause of cancer-related death(7). Cancer cachexia not
only increases patients’ mortality, but also impairs the response to first and second line chemo-
/radiotherapy(5). Specifically, the presence of cachexia in patients treated with immune checkpoints blockade
agents (ICIs), which has significant improved the long term survival for the patients with advanced non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (8-10), may promote primary resistance to immunotherapy because of suboptimal
drug exposure due to the hypothesis that the anorexia/cachexia-related metabolic wasting may accelerate
antibody blood clearance (11, 12). Therefore, early identification of patients likely to develop cachexia is
critically needed by the scientific community to initiate the interventions as early as possible to optimize the
treatment of cachexia and attenuate its development (13). Early identification of cachexia-prone patients may
also help predict prognosis of ICIs to guide treatment(5).
      To identify patients with high risk of developing to cachexia at early stage, prior studies have attempted to
define criteria for pre-cachexia, a stage when early clinical and metabolic signs such as anorexia and
inflammation were present, but substantial weight loss was not (4), utilizing weight loss, body mass index
(BMI)(14), anorexia, systemic inflammation(15), biochemistry, food intake, activities and functional status (16).
However, these studies were analyzed based on overall survival, and couldn’t be used for cachexia prediction.
      The main causes of cancer-associated cachexia are systemic metabolic modifications including excess
catabolism, increased energy expenditure and inflammation, which are determined by tumor-driven molecular
alterations (11, 17). Additionally, metabolic alterations associated with malignant disease may alter lymphocyte
function by limiting the availability of key nutrients(18). As a metabolic imaging technique, 18F-FDG PET/CT is

sensitive in reflecting metabolic changes. 18F-FDG uptake assessed by PET/CT has been shown to be also
associated with cellular and molecular alterations(19), and to reflect not only the number of lymphocytes, but
also the activation state of the lymphocytes themselves(20). Further, the recent “radiomics” analysis, which
converts medical images into high-dimensional mineable data(21), can successfully predict tumor gene
mutations (22-25) and protein expression (26). However, the association between PET/CT based radiomics and
cachexia hasn’t been well investigated. Therefore, we hypothesized that radiomics analysis of the primary
tumor from pre-treatment PET/CT images can predict the probability of developing cachexia.
     In this study, we utilize NSCLC patients receiving ICIs, some of whom developed cachexic during their
therapeutic course, were utilized to develop a radiomics model to predict cachexia during the course of
immunotherapy and to investigate the prognostic value of the generated radiomics signature.
Patients and Methods
Patients
     Retrospective patient cohorts were identified from two institutions: H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center &
Research Institute (HLM) and the James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital (VA), both in Tampa, Florida. Inclusion
criteria included patients with histologically confirmed advanced stage (IIIB and IV) NSCLC who were treated
with anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade between June 2011 and August 2019. The detailed
exclusion criteria are provided in Figure 1 and include: (a) PET/CT images not available before the start of
immunotherapy; (b) ≥ 3 months between the PET/CT acquisition and the start of immunotherapy; (c) other
treatments that were performed between imaging acquisition and start of treatment; (d) follow-up time of <6
months after start of treatment; (d) no weight record six month after the start of the immunotherapy. Thus, 175
patients from HLM, who was split into training (N=123) and test cohorts (N=52) randomly by 70-30% and 35
external patients (test) from the VA were used to train and test the radiomics signatures to predict cachexia,
and to investigate the association of the radiomics signature and the clinical outcomes.

      Clinical characteristics including age at diagnosis, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, history of
COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), Eastern Clinical Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
(PS), and sites of distant metastasis (M) were obtained from the medical records. BMI was categorized
according to: 20.0 kg/m2, underweight; 20.0 to 24.9 kg/m2, normal weight; 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2, overweight; and
30.0 kg/m2, obese(27). Cachexia was defined as patients with more than 5% weight loss over past 6 months, or
more than 2% weight loss with body mass index (BMI) less than 20 kg/m2. Progression free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) defined as the time from the start date of immunotherapy to progression (defined
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST1.1)) and death, were chosen as the end
points of the study. Patients free of progression (or death) or lost to follow-up were censored at the time of
last confirmed contact.
      This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at University of South Florida (USF) and the
James A. Haley Veterans Hospital, and was conducted in accordance with ethical standards of the 1964 Helsinki
Declaration and its later amendments. The requirement for informed consent was waived, as no PHI is
reported.
PET/CT Image Analysis
      The details of PET/CT imaging analysis are presented in supplementary section 1 and the pipeline of this
study is provided in Figure 2. Briefly, all PET images were converted into SUV units by normalizing the activity
concentration to the dosage of 18F-FDG injected and the patient body weight after decay correction. Muscles
were identified in two to four adjacent axial images within the CT series at the third lumbar vertebra, including
rectus abdominus, abdominal (lateral and oblique), psoas, and paraspinal (quadratus lumborum, erector
spinae) by a 5-year experienced orthopedist (Y. W.). These images were refined with a Hounsfield unit (HU)
range of -29 to 150 Human averaged for each patient. The total muscle cross-sectional area (cm2) was
normalized for height in meters squared (m2) and reported as lumbar Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI) in cm2/m2
(27).

     The primary lung tumors of PET and CT images were semi-automatically segmented with an improved
level-set method based on the gradient fields (28), and 30 randomly selected nodules in the training cohort
were segmented twice. After spatial registration using a rigid transformation by maximizing the Dice Similarity
Coefficients on the condition that the maximal axial cross sections of the tumor nodules were aligned, fusion
images were generated from the fused PET and CT images on a voxel-wise basis (29). Additionally, on each
tumor-restricted PET image, Otsu thresholding (30) was performed to automatically maximize inter-class
variance. Using the obtained threshold, the corresponding tumor of PET images was divided into high and low
metabolic (SUV) regions, representing distinct habitats. The masks of these two habitats were then mapped to
the co-registered CT images, and two CT sub-regions were subsequently obtained. Therefore, four sub-regions
regions of PET and CT images including PEThigh, PETlow, CThigh, and CTlow were included. Consequently, 1053
quantitative features (31) (364 whole-tumor PET features, 364 whole-tumor CT features, 65 fusion features,
and 260 habitat imaging based features) were extracted. Details are provided in Supplementary Section 2.
Feature Selection and Construction of the Radiomics Signature
     To reduce the dimension of the radiomics features, a four-step feature selection procedure was performed
to obtain the key radiomic features to predict cachexia. Firstly, the inter-rater agreement of the radiomics
features were calculated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between segmentations, and only the
features with ICC larger than 0.8 were retained. Then, a two-sample T test was used to pre-select the radiomics
features that were significantly (P<0.05) different between the cachexia and non-cachexia patients. Next, to
reduce redundancy, the significantly different                     were grouped according to the absolute value Pearson
correlation coefficient (denoted by |r|) of 0.9, and only the single feature with the largest classification ability,
based on area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), in each group were selected to be
representative (the “Avatar”) for that group Finally, a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operators
procedure (LASSO)-logistic regression analysis was used to select the most useful predictive features with non-

zero coefficients, and generate the radiomics signature (RS) through a linear combination weighted by the
corresponding coefficients (32). The penalty parameter (λ) in LASSO was selected using 10-fold cross validation
by minimum mean cross-validated error.
Statistical Analysis
      The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Fisher’s exact test were used to test the differences for continuous
variables and categorical variables, respectively. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to test for
correlations between continuous variables. The cutoffs of RS and SMI used for the classification were
determined by maximizing Youden’s index based on the training cohort. Univariable and multivariable logistical
regression models (backward step-down selection with Akaike information criterion as the stopping rule)(33),
which were presented as radiomics nomograms, were used to assess the predictive ability of RS, SMI, clinical
common used metrics including SUVmax, MTV (metabolic tumor volume) and volume (from CT images), and
other clinical characteristics (categorized BMI, sex, age, smoke status, COPD, ECOG, distant metastasis, and
histology). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
and the 95% confidence interval (CI) by the Delong method(34) were used to assess the ability of different
models in discriminating between cachexia and non-cachexia patients. To demonstrate the significantly
incremental value of different models, total net reclassification improvement (NRI) was calculated. For PFS and
OS comparison, Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were used. P-value less than 0.05 was regarded as
significant, and statistical analyses were conducted with R (version 3.5.1) and MATLAB (R2019b).

Results
Clinical characteristics
      The clinical characteristics of the patients used to train and test the predictor for cachexia are presented in
Table 1. Among these 175 patients (96 males, 79 females), the mean age was 66 ± 12 years with a median PFS
and OS of 8.40 and 27.6 months, respectively. Of these, 69 patients experienced more than 5% weight loss
(weight change: -10.28 ± 4.63 kg/m2) during the first six months of immunotherapy, and were regarded as
cachectic. All 35 of the external VA patients (Supplementary Table S1) are male, with the mean age of 71.40 ±
7.19 years. Ten patients had stage IIIB disease, while the remaining 25 patients were stage IV. The median PFS
and OS are 8.13 months and 13.10 months, respectively. Of the 29 patients who had their weight recorded six
months after the start of the immunotherapy, 14 of them suffered from cachexia with an accompanying weight
loss of 8.93 ± 3.16 kg/m2.
Feature Selection and radiomics signature development
      Twenty-seven non-redundant features were found to be significantly different between the cachexic and
non-cachexic patients in the training set and these were entered into the LASSO analysis. Of these, nine
features were selected out of training to construct the radiomics signature, and these were incorporated into
the calculation formula (supplementary section 4). Representative images and radiomics signatures (RS) of two
patients from baseline PET/CT scan are shown in Figure 3A-B.
Diagnostic performance of the radiomics signature
      The RS was significantly different between cachexic and non-cachexic patients in the training cohort
(p<0.001), which was validated in the test cohort (p=0.003) and external test cohort (p=0.040). Though the RS
was obtained based on the binarized cachexia vs. non-cachexia, the RS was also found to be weakly but
significantly correlated with the actual weight change within 6 months since the start of the immunotherapy in
both training (Pearson rho = -0.35, p<.001) and test cohorts (Pearson rho = -0.34, p=.013) as shown in Figure

3C-D, indicating that a larger RS corresponds to a larger weight loss. This RS yielded an AUC of 0.77 (95%CI:
0.70-0.84) and 0.75 (95%CI: 0.64-0.85) in the training and test cohorts, respectively, and an accuracy of 72.36%
(95%CI: 64.23-80.49) and 71.15% (95%CI: 59.62-82.69) in the training and test cohorts, respectively. Detailed
information of radiomics signature performance is shown in Table 2, and the corresponding ROC curves are
shown in Figure 3E-F. Additionally, this signature also had a good performance in the external VA cohort with
an AUC of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.53-0.92), accuracy of 72.41% (95%CI: 55.17-89.29%), sensitivity of 76.92%
(95%CI:53.85-100%), and specificity of 68.75% (95%CI:43.75-87.50%).
     Though quantitative indices (BMI and SMI) have been significantly associated with cachexia in other
studies(27), neither was significant in our study. BMI achieved an AUC of 0.63 (95%CI: 0.52-0.73, p=0.016) and
0.50 (95%CI: 0.34-0.66, p=0.98) in the training and test cohorts, respectively. SMI provided no significant
discrimination ability with AUC of 0.54 (95%CI: 0.43-0.65, p=0.46) and 0.61 (95%CI: 0.46-0.77, p=0.17) in the
training and test cohorts, respectively.
     Among the HLM patients, 73 patients had weight record of 6 months before the start of the
immunotherapy, and 16 of them had history of cachexia. Therefore, a stratified analysis only focusing on the
patients without history of cachexia (n=57) was performed. For these patients, the RS, BMI, and SMI achieved
different AUCs of 0.76 (95%CI:0.60-0.92, p=0.009), 0.77 (95%CI:0.60-0.94, p=0.006), and 0.82 (98%CI: 0.68-
0.95, p=0.001), but the differences among them were not statistically different (RS vs SMI: p=0.57, RS vs BMI:
p=0.89, BMI vs SMI: p=0.74, Delong test).
Clinical prediction model and decision curve analyses
     For the univariable logistical regression analysis of the clinical variables, categorized BMI, ECOG PS, and
distant metastasis were identified as strong predictors for cachexia (p=0.018, p=0.017 and p=0.015,
respectively, Table S2). A clinical prediction model was thus trained by incorporating these three clinical
variables using multivariable logistic regression analysis which achieved AUC of 0.70 (95%CI: 0.62-0.79) and
0.65 (95%CI: 0.49-0.80) in the training and test cohorts, respectively (Details are shown in Table 2).

     We then incorporated the RS into the clinical prediction model using further multivariate logistic
regression analysis (Supplementary Table S2), and this is presented as radiomics nomogram shown in Figure
4A. The combined model significantly improved the prediction ability with AUCs of 0.78 (95%CI: 0.69-0.86,
p=0.03, Delong test) and 0.76 (95%CI: 0.61-0.89, p=0.047, Delong test) in the training and test cohorts,
respectively (Details are shown in Table 2). Further, the inclusion of RS yielded a total net reclassification
improvement (NRI) of 0.91 (95%CI: 0.59-1.23, p<0.001) and 0.91 (95%CI: 0.43-1.39, p<0.001) in the training and
test cohorts, respectively, which further showed significantly improved classification accuracy for cachexia
prediction over clinical variables alone. Qualitatively, calibration curves (Figure 4C) indicate the agreement
between the estimated probability and the actual cachexia rate based on the training (p=0.37) and test (p=0.99)
cohorts, respectively.
     Decision curve analyses (Figure 4D) show the performance of the RS, clinical model, and radiomics
nomogram model in clinical application in both training and test cohorts. These show that the radiomics
nomogram model showed significant advantages than schema wherein all patients or no patients are assumed
to have cachexia. When comparing the three models, the radiomics nomogram model had the highest overall
net clinical benefit across the threshold probabilities within the range of 0.30-0.60 in both cohorts.
     However, there were no significant differences in predictive ability in both training (p=0.58) and test
cohorts (p=0.79) when comparing the RS and the radiomics nomogram. Even for the 57 patients without
history of cachexia, the radiomics nomogram achieved higher but also not significant AUC of 0.86 (95%CI: 0.74-
0.97, p=0.081, Delong test), compared to the RS alone. Therefore, only RS was used for the following
prognostic investigation.
Prognostic value of the radiomics signature in immunotherapy
     The RSs of the patients who experienced durable clinical benefit (DCB, PFS>6 months) were significantly
lower compared to those who did not in both the training (0.32 vs. 0.46, p<0.001) and test (0.37 vs. 0.43,
p=0.060) cohorts, similar results could be found in the external VA test patients (0.38 vs 0.45, p=0.056). The

AUCs of the RS to identify the DCB patients were 0.67 (95%CI: 0.57-0.77, p=0.002), 0.66 (95%CI: 0.51-0.81,
p=0.0045), and 0.72 (95%CI: 0.54-0.89, p=0.0029) in the training, test and external VA test cohorts,
respectively.
      For the training patients, the PFS and OS were significantly longer among patients with low RS (<0.40)
versus patients with high RS (PFS: hazard ratio [HR]:1.73, 95%CI: 1.10-2.73, p=0.018; OS: HR: 2.32, 95%CI:1.17-
4.63, p=0.017). Among patients with low RS, the median PFS was 11.00 months compared to 5.90 months or
patients with high RS (PFS: P=0.016, Figure 5A). Median OS was not reached in the low RS group and was 19.77
months in the high RS group (p=0.014, Figure 5B). For the test patients, similar results could also be observed
in training cohort with HR of 2.18 (95%CI: 1.09-4.38, p=0.028) and 2.62 (95%CI: 1.05-6.56, p=0.040) for PFS and
OS estimation, respectively. Median PFS of the patients with low RS was significantly longer with 17.00 months
versus 4.17 months (p=0.024, Figure 5C), and the median OS was also not reached in the low RS group and was
19.77 months in the high RS group (p=0.014, Figure 5D). Through log-rank test, there was not significant
difference between RS and real occurrence of cachexia. The external VA test patients further validate the
prognostic value of RS with HRs of 2.63 (95%CI: 1.02-6.83, p=0.046) and 3.84 (95%CI: 1.56-9.43, p=0.049, Figure
5E) for PFS (4.77 vs 12.97 months, p=0.002, Figure 5F) and OS (8.37 vs 22.17 months, p=0.039), respectively.

Discussion
     In this study, we found that BMI, distant metastasis, ECOG, and the radiomics signature (RS) of diagnostic
PET/CT images, were significant and independent cachexia predictors in patients with advanced stage NSCLC
treated with immunotherapy. Importantly, these data can be routinely captured during patient workup as
standard of care. The radiomics signature developed in this work further showed significant prognostic value.
Therefore, this approach has the potential to be used to optimize patient management and treatment plan
with early interventions prior to the start of immunotherapy. As far as we know, this is the first radiomics study
of cachexia prediction.
     Cancer therapy, could limit tumor growth to suppress the tumor-associated processes responsible for
weight loss, but can also induce weight loss due to the potential interference with pathways of muscle
anabolism, which means it is difficult to separate cancer cachexia from the effects and complications after
cancer therapy. Though not directly a component of cancer-associated cachexia, treatment-associated weight
loss is best viewed as an integral part of the syndrome (1). Therefore, the weight loss since the start of the
immunotherapy was used to define the cachexia of the enrolled NSCLC patients treated with ICIs. Though
cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome defined by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass, the causes of
cachexia are usually determined by tumor-driven molecular alterations (11, 17) and tumoral factors have been
shown to be important in cancer cachexia(35). Therefore, we hypothesize that the primary tumor could reflect
most of the genetic and micro-environmental information. Given that radiomics is a promising approach in
characterizing tumors, it is reasonable to develop a radiomics signature to predict cachexia using radiomics
analysis of the primary nodule.
     Given cachexia is defined primarily by unintended weight loss, several studies have investigated and
shown the cachexia-indicative value of initial weight loss (15, 36-38). Additionally, BMI(36), ECOG PS,
biochemistry (high C-reactive protein, leukocytes, hypoalbuminemia, or anemia) (37), cancer type, and
COPD(38) have also been used to construct cachexia prediction models. Further, CT-based SMI was shown to
be predictive of cachexia and survival of patients with cancer(27). However, none of these variables

characterized the metabolic changes, characteristic of cancer-associated cachexia. As far as we know, this is the
first study to predict cachexia using baseline PET/CT images before the start of the immunotherapy.
      When investigating the relationship between clinical characteristics and cachexia, BMI, ECOG PS, and
distant metastasis were highly correlated with cachexia, which are consistent with most other studies.
However, in contrast to other studies, SMI showed no statistically significant difference between cachexia and
non-cachexia (27). A further stratified sub-analysis of patients without a prior history of cachexia showed that
SMI was a significant predictor (OR: 0.76, 95%CI: 0.62-0.93, p=0.008) and could achieve high AUC in predicting
cachexia. This may indicate that SMI is a good predictor for those patients who hadn’t yet developed cachexia.
Additionally, tumor volume and metabolic tumor volume were also not significant predictors, which is
consistent with prior observations that cachexia was not tumor size dependent (39, 40). For the investigation
of initial weight loss, though the weight loss of the past 6 months and 2 months were also significant factors
with OR of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.71-1.01, p=0.056) and 0.78 (95%CI: 0.61-1.00, p=0.049) in the patients who have
history weight loss record before the start of the immunotherapy in our study, this factor was not included in
the multi-variable analysis in our study due to its unavailability for most of the patients.
      The present study does possess some limitations, however. First, because the sample size of patients with
history weight loss record was small relative to the entire cohort, which means the predictive value of initial
weight loss for the whole cohort couldn’t be incorporated into the prediction model. However, initial weight
loss is unavailable for some patients, especially for the patients who received first-line immunotherapy after
the diagnosis, which means the clinical use of a model with initial weight loss may be limited. Second, the
patient cohorts were heterogeneous in terms of PET/CT image acquisition. However, this also be viewed as a
strength of the current approach, and the prognostic value in the external test cohort showed that the
developed radiomics signature is robust and transportable.

Conclusions
      In conclusion, an effective radiomics signature from pretreatment PET/CT images has been identified and
may serve as a predictive biomarker to identify both patients who have larger risk of developing cachexia after
the start of the immunotherapy, and patients most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Due to the
advantage of being based on routinely acquired patient information and its non-invasive characteristic, this
signature could be used for optimizing the treatment plan pending in larger and prospective trials.

Figure 4. Radiomics Nomograms. The nomogram constructed with RS and clinical variables to estimate the
risk of cachexia(A), along with the assessment of the model calibration in the augmented training cohort as
well as the training and test cohorts (B). (C) is the box plot of nomogram predicted cachexia probability of
individual. In the box plots, the central line represents the median, the bounds of box the first and third
quartiles, and the whiskers are the interquartile range. The blue points represent the training cohort, and the
magenta points represent the test cohort. P value shows two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test. (D) is the
decision curves of RS, radiomics nomogram and clinical model in the training and test cohorts.
