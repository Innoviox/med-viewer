16     Abstract
17
18     Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium are Gram-positive bacteria that normally inhabit the human
19     gastrointestinal tract. They are also opportunistic pathogens and can cause nosocomial infection
20     outbreaks. To prevent the spread of nosocomial infections, hospitals may rely on screening
21     methods to identify patients colonized with multidrug-resistant organisms including vancomycin-
22     resistant enterococci (VRE). Spectra VRE agar (Remel) contains vancomycin and other medium
23     components that select for VRE and phenotypically differentiate between faecalis and faecium
24     species by colony color. We obtained 66 de-identified rectal swab cultures on Spectra VRE agar
25     that were obtained during routine patient admission surveillance at a Dallas, Texas hospital. We
26     analyzed 90 presumptive VRE from 61 of the Spectra VRE agar cultures using molecular and
27     culture methods. Using ddl typing, 55 were found to be E. faecium and 32 were found to be E.
28     faecalis. While most of the E. faecium were positive for the vanA gene by PCR (52 of 55 strains),
29     few of the E. faecalis were positive for either vanA or vanB (5 of 32 strains). The 27 E. faecalis
30     vanA- and vanB-negative strains could not be recultured on Spectra VRE agar. Overall, we found
31     that Spectra VRE agar performed robustly for the identification of vancomycin-resistant E.
32     faecium, but presumptive false positives were obtained for vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis.

35     Introduction
36
37     Vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE), typically Enterococcus faecium and less commonly E.
38     faecalis, are hospital-associated pathogens of significant public health concern. VRE are among
39     the antibiotic-resistant pathogens identified by the United States Centers for Disease Control and
40     Prevention as being serious threats to public health (1).
41
42     It is important to distinguish VRE from vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE). VSE are
43     normal colonizers of the human gastrointestinal tract (2). Like VRE, VSE can opportunistically
44     cause infections, but more treatment options are available for infections with VSE. There are a
45     number of surveillance methods that can be employed to identify patients colonized with VRE and
46     to guide infection control practices in clinical settings. These methods typically involve culture-
47     based screening of rectal swabs or fecal material on media containing vancomycin. One such
48     medium is Spectra VRE agar (Remel). Spectra VRE agar contains 6 µg/mL vancomycin and
49     proprietary chromogens that allow distinction between E. faecium and E. faecalis based on colony
50     color.
51
52     In this study, we analyzed presumptive VRE obtained during routine patient admission screening
53     for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) at a Dallas, Texas, hospital. Our goals were to validate
54     the isolates obtained from Spectra VRE agar cultures and to develop a strain collection to be used
55     in future studies of enterococcal biology.
56
57     Materials and Methods
58
59     Culture methods and molecular biology procedures. Unless otherwise stated, enterococci
60     were cultured at 37°C in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth or on BHI agar. Spectra VRE agar plates
                                                                                                                                          3

61     for independent testing of presumptive VRE isolates were purchased from Fisher Scientific.
62     Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). Taq polymerase
63     (New England Biolabs) was used for PCR. PCR products used for sequencing analysis were
64     purified using the GeneJET PCR Purification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequencing of PCR
65     products was performed at the Massachusetts General Hospital CCBI Core facility.
66
67     Collection of presumptive VRE. Presumptive VRE were collected at the Methodist Dallas Health
68     System during routine MDRO surveillance. Surveillance culture screening was performed on
69     patients admitted with at least one of these risk factors: hospitalization for ≥2 consecutive nights
70     in the preceding 30 days, transferred from another medical facility, residence in a nursing home
71     or extended/long term care facility, or the presence of decubitus ulcer or a draining wound. We
72     obtained rectal swab cultures that were performed as a part of these routine admission
73     surveillance procedures (UT-Dallas protocol number MR 14-448 and Methodist Health System
74     protocol number P15MHS.0001A). The rectal swabs were plated on Spectra VRE agar. Instead
75     of disposal after clinical surveillance was complete, Spectra VRE plates with visible growth were
76     coded numerically, deidentified, and transferred to the University of Texas at Dallas for further
77     analysis of presumptive VRE. One plate corresponded to one unique patient. Spectra VRE plates
78     were collected from August 2015 through October 2015. At least one colony from each Spectra
79     VRE plate was sub-cultured into BHI broth, incubated overnight, and stored at -80°C with 25%
80     glycerol. If multiple colony phenotypes were observed from one Spectra VRE plate (for example,
81     multiple different colony colors or morphologies), representative colonies of each phenotype were
82     picked.
83
84     Species determination and van typing. Primers used in this study are shown in Table S1. ddl
85     primer sets used to identify E. faecalis and E. faecium, and the type of vancomycin resistance
86     (vanA or vanB), were previously reported (3, 4). In the event that an isolate was neither E. faecium
                                                                                                                                          4

 87     or E. faecalis by ddl PCR, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using universal primers 8S and
 88     1492R (5) and sequenced. At least 1300 non-ambiguous bases were used as query against the
 89     NCBI nr/nt database by megaBLAST. Hits with 100% query coverage and the highest percent
 90     sequence identity are reported. Boiled colonies were used as a template for PCR where possible;
 91     for some isolates, purified genomic DNA was used as a template.
 92
 93     Vancomycin MIC. Vancomycin susceptibility was assessed for a subset of isolates using broth
 94     microdilution. Twofold serial dilutions of drug were made with BHI broth in a 96-well microtiter
 95     plate. An overnight culture was diluted to an OD600nm of 0.001, and 5 µL were used to inoculate
 96     the wells of the plate. The MIC was recorded after 24 hours incubation at 37°C. Broth microdilution
 97     experiments were performed twice independently for each strain.
 98
 99     Spectra VRE growth test. Select stocked isolates of interest were inoculated onto Spectra VRE
100     agar to confirm whether growth occurred. Overnight cultures in BHI broth were diluted to an
101     OD600nm of 0.005 in 1-3 mL fresh BHI broth, then incubated at 37°C for 3.5 hours. 100 µL culture
102     was spread plated onto Spectra VRE agar; for some isolates, 50 µL culture was spread over one
103     half of the plate. A subset of strains were also inoculated on BHI agar supplemented with 6 µg/mL
104     vancomycin. Plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C. E. faecium 1,231,410, a VanA-type VRE
105     (6) and E. faecalis V583, a VanB-Type VRE (7, 8), were included as positive controls, yielding
106     purple and light blue lawns, respectively.
107
108     MLST and CRISPR-Cas analysis of select E. faecalis strains. The MLST database
109     (https://pubmlst.org/efaecalis/) and sequencing of internal fragments of seven house-keeping
110     genes were used as previously described (9) to determine the sequence type (ST) of 11 E.
111     faecalis isolates. Novel STs were submitted to the database. PCR was used to screen 23 E.

112     faecalis isolates for the presence of three previously identified E. faecalis CRISPR loci (CRISPR1-
113     Cas, CRISPR2, and CRISPR3-Cas) (10, 11). Specifically, previously reported primer sets were
114     used to screen for the presence of CRISPR1 cas9 and CRISPR3 cas9 (10). Strains with negative
115     cas9 results were then confirmed to lack the entire CRISPR-Cas loci by using previously reported
116     primer sets that anneal outside the conserved chromosomal locations were the loci occur (10).
117     CRISPR2 arrays were amplified and sequenced as previously described (10, 12). CRISPR2
118     spacer sequences were compared with a previously reported CRISPR2 spacer dictionary
119     generated from 228 E. faecalis genomes (12).
120
121     Results
122
123     Initial analysis of Spectra VRE cultures. We obtained 66 Spectra VRE plates with visible
124     bacterial growth, corresponding to 66 presumptive VRE-positive patients. Subsequently, 100
125     colonies of interest were identified and stocked for further analysis (Table S2). Based on colony
126     color, 33 were presumptive E. faecalis VRE (light blue color), 64 were presumptive E. faecium
127     VRE (navy blue or purple), and 3 colonies had atypical color (white) (Table S2).
128
129     Confirmation of species prediction. Of the 100 stocked strains, 10 could not be revived from
130     freezer stock (Table S2). Of these, 1 was a presumptive E. faecalis by colony color, and 9 were
131     presumptive E. faecium by colony color. The inability to revive these isolates reduced our isolate
132     number to 90 and our patient cohort size from 66 to 61.
133
134     Primer sets designed to amplify the ddl genes of E. faecium and E. faecalis (3, 4) were used to
135     determine the species of the 90 presumptive VRE isolates. For strains where ddl PCR yielded
136     negative results for both E. faecalis and E. faecium primer sets, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified
137     and sequenced.
                                                                                                                                           6

138
139     Of the 32 presumptive E. faecalis VRE that were recovered from freezer stock, 25 were confirmed
140     to be E. faecalis by ddl PCR, and 7 were not confirmed by E. faecalis ddl PCR. Of these 7 strains,
141     6 were found to be E. faecium by ddl PCR, and 1 was found to be a presumptive E. raffinosus or
142     E. gilvus by 16S rRNA gene analysis (99.78% sequence identity). In total, 78% of the colonies
143     predicted to be E. faecalis based on Spectra VRE colony color were confirmed to be E. faecalis
144     using ddl typing (Table S2).
145
146     Of the 55 presumptive E. faecium VRE that were recovered from freezer stock, 47 were confirmed
147     to be E. faecium by ddl PCR, 1 was a mixed culture of E. faecium and E. faecalis, and 7 were not
148     confirmed by E. faecium ddl PCR. Of these, all 7 were found to be E. faecalis by ddl PCR. In total,
149     85% of the colonies predicted to be E. faecium based on Spectra VRE colony color were
150     confirmed to be E. faecium using ddl typing (Table S2).
151
152     Of the 3 atypical white colonies, two were found to be E. faecium by ddl PCR, and one was found
153     to be Staphylococcus epidermidis by 16S rRNA gene analysis (99.85% sequence identity) (Table
154     S2).
155
156     In summary, of the 90 presumptive VRE isolates analyzed using ddl typing, 55 were found to be
157     E. faecium, 32 were found to be E. faecalis, 2 were found to be neither, and one was a mixed
158     culture.
159
160     Determination of vancomycin resistance type and re-testing for growth on Spectra VRE.
161     Vancomycin resistance in enterococci is conferred by the synthesis of peptidoglycan precursors
162     for which vancomycin has reduced binding affinity (13). Vancomycin resistance loci can be
163     classified by the gene sequences for the D-alanine-D-lactate ligases, VanA and VanB, which are
                                                                                                                                           7

164     the most prevalent vancomycin resistance types for hospital-associated VRE (14). We screened
165     our isolates for the presence of vanA and vanB using previously reported primer sets (3, 4).
166
167     Of the 55 ddl-confirmed E. faecium, 52 were positive for vanA and negative for vanB, and 3 were
168     negative for both vanA and vanB (Table S3). Broth microdilution with vancomycin was performed
169     for 14 of the 52 vanA-positive isolates to confirm their vancomycin resistance, and their
170     vancomycin MICs were all ≥256 µg/mL, as expected. The 3 isolates that were negative for both
171     vanA and vanB were assessed for growth on Spectra VRE agar, and they did not grow, indicating
172     that the initial clinical cultures were false positives. Broth microdilution with vancomycin was
173     performed for these three isolates. Two of the isolates had vancomycin MICs of 2 µg/mL. One
174     isolate (163-2) had a vancomycin MIC of 512 µg/mL, despite being negative by PCR for both
175     vanA and vanB and failing to be re-cultured on Spectra VRE. Further investigation is required to
176     determine the genetic basis for the phenotypes observed for this strain.
177
178     Of the 32 ddl-confirmed E. faecalis, 4 were positive for vanA and negative for vanB, 1 was positive
179     for vanB and negative for vanA, and the other 27 were negative for both vanA and vanB (Table
180     S4). All ddl-confirmed E. faecalis were assessed for growth on Spectra VRE agar. Only the 5
181     vanA- or vanB-positive strains grew robustly on Spectra VRE. For the other 27 strains, no growth
182     was observed, except that a single light blue colony was observed for each of isolates 107-2 and
183     110. Nine of these 27 vanA- and vanB-negative strains were also assessed for growth on BHI
184     agar supplemented with 6 µg/mL vancomycin, and they failed to grow. Overall, these results
185     suggest that the initial clinical cultures for 27 of the 32 E. faecalis strains were false positives on
186     Spectra VRE. To follow up on these results, broth microdilution with vancomycin was performed
187     for 5 of these isolates, and their vancomycin MICs were 2-4 µg/mL. Additional investigation is
                                                                                                                                           8

188     required to determine the mechanism for incongruence between initial clinical culture on Spectra
189     VRE and subsequent molecular typing and Spectra VRE re-culture results.
190
191     Finally, the presumptive E. raffinosus/E. gilvus isolate was found to be vanA-positive and vanB-
192     negative (Table S5). This isolate was assessed for growth on Spectra VRE, and it grew, forming
193     light purple colonies. The broth microdilution vancomycin MIC for this strain is 128 µg/mL.
194
195     MLST and CRISPR2 analysis of select E. faecalis isolates. We used MLST (9) and a
196     previously published CRISPR-based typing method for E. faecalis (12) to assess phylogenetic
197     relationships among a subset of the E. faecalis isolates. MLST uses sequence variation in 7
198     housekeeping loci to characterize phylogenetic relationships between strains. CRISPRs are
199     hypervariable loci consisting of short (36 base pair) repeats interspersed by short (30 base pair)
200     spacer sequences in E. faecalis (10, 11). Comparative analysis of CRISPR spacer sequences is
201     an alternative method to MLST to analyze relationships between strains (15).
202
203     The sequence type (ST) of 11 E. faecalis isolates was determined, including 2 vanA-positive
204     isolates and the single vanB-positive isolate. Eight STs were identified (Table 1). Five of the
205     eleven isolates were novel STs (ST777, ST778, ST779), including the two vanA isolates (both
206     ST779) and the vanB isolate (ST778). ST16 (2 isolates) and ST179 (one isolate) are single-locus
207     variants of each other. Otherwise, all strains varied at ≥ 3 of the 7 loci relative to each other.
208
209     The CRISPR2 arrays of 23 E. faecalis isolates were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed (Table
210     1). We compared the CRISPR2 spacer sequences obtained here with our previous analysis of
211     CRISPR2 loci in 228 E. faecalis genomes, wherein spacers of unique sequence were assigned

214     (denoted as letters in Table 1). Eight of the 23 isolates, corresponding to 8 patients, had identical
215     CRISPR2 loci of spacers 85-83-86-82.
216
217     We also determined the occurrence of the previously identified CRISPR-Cas loci, CRISPR1-Cas
218     and CRISPR3-Cas (10, 11), among the 23 E. faecalis analyzed for CRISPR2 typing (Table 1).
219     Both of these systems can protect E. faecalis from the acquisition of mobile genetic elements that
220     confer antibiotic resistance (16, 17). No isolates possessed CRISPR3-Cas. Two of the 23 isolates
221     possessed CRISPR1-Cas (Table 1).
222
223     Two E. faecalis isolates from patient number 142 were analyzed by both MLST and CRISPR2
224     typing (Table 1). The isolates were of different STs and different CRISPR2 types, demonstrating
225     co-colonization of the patient 142 gastrointestinal tract by genetically distinct E. faecalis.

227     Conclusions
228
229     We report the collection and initial analysis of presumptive VRE obtained from hospitalized
230     patients in Dallas, Texas. Our short-term goal (this study) was to validate the isolates obtained
231     from Spectra VRE agar cultures. Our long-term goal is to use genome sequencing approaches to
232     study the phylogeny and antibiotic resistance of these isolates.
233
234     We determined that most (52 of 55; 94.5%) of ddl-confirmed E. faecium from Spectra VRE rectal
235     swab cultures were vanA-positive, while most (27 of 32; 84%) of ddl-confirmed E. faecalis were
236     negative for both vanA and vanB. All of the vanA- and vanB-negative strains failed to be recultured
237     on Spectra VRE, with the exceptions of a single colony observed for each of two E. faecalis
238     strains. Conversely, control VRE strains and 6 vanA- and vanB-positive rectal swab strains were
239     robustly cultured on Spectra VRE, as expected. There were key differences between use of the
                                                                                                                                         10

240     Spectra VRE agar in the clinical microbiology versus research labs. First, different batches of the
241     agar were used. Second, the inoculation methods differed. In the clinical microbiology lab, rectal
242     swabs (mixed cultures) were used to inoculate the agar, while in the research lab, high density
243     pure cultures were spread on the agar. That said, of the 30 total isolates that failed to be recultured
244     on Spectra VRE, we determined vancomycin MIC for 8 of them, and 7 had vancomycin MICs of
245     2-4 µg/mL. The concentration of vancomycin in Spectra VRE is 6 µg/mL, therefore it is expected
246     that these strains should not grow on this medium. A final point is that in the clinical microbiology
247     lab, the results of the entire agar culture are used to guide surveillance decisions, while in our
248     research study, we selected only 1-3 single colonies per plate for analysis. Therefore, we cannot
249     comment on whether the total Spectra VRE rectal swab culture was comprised of vancomycin-
250     sensitive strains, or merely certain colonies. That said, we are not the first to observe false
251     positives using Spectra VRE agar, particularly for E. faecalis. In a previous study, patient age was
252     significantly correlated with false positive vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis results (18). For our
253     strain collection, genome sequencing and more phenotypic assessments of vancomycin
254     susceptibility and heterogeneity will be used in future studies to characterize these isolates
255     further.
256
257     In conclusion, we present a collection of fecal enterococcal isolates from the Dallas, Texas, area.
258     Most VRE identified via Spectra VRE agar were confirmed to be VanA-type E. faecium.

Table S3. Data for ddl -confirmed E. faecium strains.
   Notes:
* For PCR analysis, an empty cell indicates a negative result for the PCR reaction.
 NT indicates Not Tested. n/a indicates that the PCR reaction was not performed because the strain could not be recovered from freezer stock.
** For Spectra VRE re-testing, a blank cell indicates that the experiment was not performed for that strain.
*** Two trials of broth microdilution were performed. If different MIC values were obtained across the two trials, both values are stated.
A blank cell indicates that the experiment was not performed for that strain.

Table S5. Data for species recovered other than E. faecalis or E. faecium .
   Notes:
* For PCR analysis, an empty cell indicates a negative result for the PCR reaction.
NT indicates Not Tested. n/a indicates that the PCR reaction was not performed because the strain could not be recovered from freezer stock.
** For Spectra VRE re-testing, a blank cell indicates that the experiment was not performed for that strain.
*** Two trials of broth microdilution were performed. A blank cell indicates that the experiment was not performed for that strain.
