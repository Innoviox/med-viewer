         Abstract:
         Aim of Study:
         Aim of this meta-analysis was to compare diagnostic accuracy of C reactive Protein and
         Procalcitonin between postoperative day 3 to 5 in predicting infectious complications post
         pancreatic surgery.
         Methods:
         Systemic literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and SCOPUS to
         identify studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-Reactive
         Protein (CRP) as a predictor for detecting infectious complications between postoperative
         days (POD) 3 to 5 following pancreatic surgery. A meta-analysis was performed using
         random effect model and pooled predictive parameters. Geometric means were calculated for
         PCT cut offs. The work has been reported in line with PRISMA guidelines.
         Results:
         After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria 15 studies consisting of 2212 patients were
         included in the final analysis according to PRISMA guidelines. Pooled sensitivity, specificity
         ,Area under curve and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR)for day 3 C-reactive protein was
         respectively 62%,67% 0.772 and 6.54.Pooled sensitivity, specificity , Area under curve and
         diagnostic odds ratio (DOR)for day 3 procalcitonin was respectively 74%,79%,0.8453 and
         11.03. Sensitivity, specificity, Area under curve, and Diagnostic odds ratio for day 4 C-
         reactive protein was respectively 60%,68%, 0.8022 and 11.90. Pooled Sensitivity, specificity
         and Diagnostic odds ratio of post-operative day 5 procalcitonin level in predicting infectious
         complications were respectively 83%,70% and 12.9. Pooled Sensitivity, specificity, AUROC
         and diagnostic odds ratio were respectively 50%,70%, 0.777 and 10.19.
         Conclusion:

         Post-operative procalcitonin is better marker to predict post-operative infectious
         complications after pancreatic surgeries and post-operative day 3 procalcitonin has highest
         diagnostic accuracy.
         Introduction:
         Pancreatic surgeries (Pancreaticoduodenectomy/ distal pancreatectomy) are the main
         treatments for various benign and malignant disease of pancreas, duodenum, and ampullary
         region. [1]. Pancreatic surgeries are still associated with very high morbidity and mortality.
         [2]. Majority of complications following pancreatic surgeries are infectious complications
         including pancreatic leaks and fistula. [3]. These complications can affect outcomes and also
         increase cost for pancreatic surgeries. [4].
         C reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin are suggested as inflammatory markers for
         diagnosing infective complications following colorectal and abdominal surgeries. [5-10].
         CRP is not considered as a specific marker for infection, as it can rise in any inflammatory
         condition. [11].
         Procalcitonin is now emerging as a useful and specific marker for sepsis and guide to
         antibiotic treatment. [12]. It is suggested as a useful marker in predicting infectious
         complications for colorectal surgeries. [5].

         However, there is still limited literature comparing effectiveness of C- Reactive Protein and
         Procalcitonin (PCT) as a marker of infectious complications post pancreatic surgeries and
         very few studies to show which is better marker to diagnose infectious complications.
         Pancreatic surgeries are highly morbid surgeries where early diagnosis of complications can
         help to reduce mortality.
         AIM of the study:
         Aim of this meta-analysis was to compare diagnostic accuracy of C reactive Protein and
         Procalcitonin between postoperative day 3 to 5 in predicting infectious complications post
         pancreatic surgery.
         Materials and Methods:
         Data collection:
         Medline (PubMed), Embase and Scopus were searched with key words like “procalcitonin”,
         “C      reactive        Protein”,       “pancreatic       surgery”,      “pancreaticoduodenectomy”,            “distal
         pancreatectomy”, “post- operative complications”, “infective complication”, “pancreatic
         leak”, “pancreatic fistula”, “anastomotic leak”. Studies after Year 2005 (last 15 years) were
         searched. Anastomotic leak and pancreatic fistula were considered as infectious
         complications and were included in search strategy. The work has been reported in line with
         PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews) and MOOSE (Meta-analysis of
         observational studies in epidemiology) guidelines. [13,14]
         Definition of post-operative infectious complications:
         Infectious complications were defined as any complications like intraabdominal abscess,
         pancreatic leak, pancreatic fistula, wound complications, urinary tract infection, post-
         operative pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome. Only clinically significant

         pancreatic fistula (ISGPS grade b/c) was considered as an infectious complication. [15]
         Screening was done by two reviewers (BV and HP) independently at the title, abstract, and
         full text stages. Any disagreements were discussed between the reviewers before a final
         decision was made.
         Study selection:
         Inclusion criteria:
              •    Randomized control trials
              •    Observational cohort study
              •    Studies which included post-operative procalcitonin or C-reactive protein level
                   between postoperative day 3 to 5.
              •    Studies where subject underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy
              •    Studies which included patients with age 18 and above.
              •    Studies which evaluated post-operative complications.
         Exclusion criteria:
              •    Studies where full text articles could not be obtained.
              •    Studies which included only post-operative day 1,2 or pre-operative procalcitonin or
                   C-reactive protein level.
         Data extraction:
         Information on study characteristics including patient population, study duration, follow-up
         period, index test, and reference standard were extracted from each study. The primary
         outcome, i.e., diagnostic performance of PCT or CRP to detect infectious complications
         reported as sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative
         predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and negative likelihood ratio (LR−)
         at POD 3 and 5, was collected. As anastomotic leakage or pancreatic fistula were considered
         a subset of infectious complications and expected to account for most cases of infectious

         complications in pancreatic surgery, it was used as the surrogate outcome of interest during
         data extraction in studies which did not specifically report infectious complications.
         Raw data from the articles were used to construct 2*2 tables (true positive, false positive, true
         negative, and false negative). When unavailable, the tables were constructed using the
         sensitivity and specificity values provided. For each study, the sensitivity and specificity
         values mentioned in the article were verified by the reconstruction of the 2*2 contingency
         table using the data specified in the article.
         Risk of bias assessment:
         The revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool
         developed by the Cochrane Collaboration was used to assess for the risk of bias and
         applicability of each study. [16].
         The tool consists of four key domains, i.e., patient selection, index test, reference standard,
         and patient flow through the study and timing of tests. Two reviewers (BV and HP) assessed
         the study quality independently. In case of disagreement, the judgment was discussed among
         themselves before a final decision. publication bias was assessed with the Deeks test. [17].
         Statistical analysis:
         The statistical analysis was performed according to the Preferred Report Items for Systematic
         Reviews and Meta- analysis (PRISMA) statement. [13]. The pooled prevalence of infectious
         complications with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated using
         random effect model. The pooled PCT and CRP cut-off value was derived using geometric
         mean of the reported PCT and CRP cut-off values. [17]. Using a random effect model, the
         pooled Se, Sp, LR+, LR−, and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) with corresponding 95% CI
         were calculated. Symmetrical summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were

         also generated. The area under the curve (AUC) and Q* index (the point on the SROC curve
         where Se and Sp were equal) were calculated, respectively.[18]. Heterogeneity was assessed
         using the Higgins I2 test, with values of 25, 50, and 75% indicating low, moderate, and high
         degrees of heterogeneity, respectively. [19]. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were
         attempted whenever feasible.
         The statistical analysis was performed using Meta-DiSc 1.4 (Hospital Ramon y Cajal and
         Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain) and revman 5.4.
         RESULTS:
         Data extraction, Study characteristics and quality assessment:
         “PUBMED”, “SCOPUS”, “EMBASE” database were searched using key words and search
         strategy described above. Initially 537 studies were screened. After exclusion of duplicates
         and unrelated studies 86 studies were thoroughly screened. After applying inclusion and
         exclusion criteria 15 studies consisting of 2212 patients were included in the final analysis
         according to PRISMA guidelines. [Figure 1]. [10,20-33]
         6 studies included analysis of Post-operative day 3 procalcitonin analysis [20-25], 8 studies
         day 3 C-reactive Protein analysis. 5 studies Included analysis of CRP of day 4. 3 studies
         included day 3 CRP analysis and 2 studies included day 5 procalcitonin analysis.
         Study containing procalcitonin analysis included 471 patients and study containing CRP
         included 1965 patients. The main characteristics of the included studies are summarized in
         Table 1. The results of the quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 are shown in Figure. 2.
         Flaw and timings were unclear in majority of studies.

         DISCUSSION:

         In our meta-analysis we evaluated role of Post-operative C-reactive protein and Procalcitonin
         in predicting post-operative infectious complications. Tan et al. [5] and cousin et al. [34] had
         done similar meta-analysis showing use of PCT as a predictor for infectious complications
         following colorectal surgeries. However, to our knowledge this is the first diagnostic
         accuracy meta-analysis which simultaneously analysed role of .C-reactive protein (CRP) and
         procalcitonin (PCT).
         Survival Sepsis Guidelines 2016.[35] suggests use of PCT as a marker for diagnosing sepsis
         as well as marker for de-escalation of antibiotics and its use in management of sepsis is
         gaining popularity now. We decided to use PCT levels at day 3 and day 5 as evidences
         suggests that PCT can be falsely elevated in first 2 post-operative days. [36,37,38].We found
         no study that reported day 4 PCT.
         CRP        is a known inflammatory marker, however CRP levels can rise in multiple
         inflammatory condition. We here evaluated day 3,4,5 CRP levels for the same reason as in
         initial post-operative days surgical stress itself can cause elevated CRP levels.
         Highest pooled sensitivity , Diagnostic odds ratio, pooled area under curve for CRP in
         detecting infectious complications were highest on 4th post-operative day which was
         respectively 60%, 11.90 and 0.8022. Highest pooled specificity was on 5th post-operative
         day, which was 70%.
         For procalcitonin pooled sensitivity, specificity, pooled area under curve was on post-
         operative day 3 which were respectively 74%,79%,0.8453 and 11.03. Pooled sensitivity,
         specificity and diagnostic odds ratios for day 5 procalcitonin were 83%,70% and 12.9.
         However only 2 studies evaluated post-operative day 5 procalcitonin levels so pooled
         area under curve could not be calculated. From above findings it seems that post-
         operative procalcitonin is more sensitive and specific than C-reactive protein in

         predicting post-operative infectious complications after pancreatic surgeries. Post-
         operative day 3 procalcitonin is found to be more accurate marker of post-operative
         infectious complications after pancreatic surgery.
         There were certain limitations of these analysis, first is that end point was not similar in
         every study. Some study evaluated infectious complications and majority evaluated
         pancreatic leak and                   fistula. We considered pancreatic fistula as an infectious
         complication. Heterogenicity was moderate to high in some analysis. Day 5 analysis
         included very small number of studies. Another limitation is majority of studies included
         pancreaticoduodenectomies only so to confirm these findings in distal pancreatectomies
         including laparoscopic distal pancreatectomies we need more data.
         However, to best of our knowledge this is the only meta-analysis in which an humble
         attempt is done to compare CRP and PCT as predictive markers for post0operative infectious
         complications after pancreatic surgeries.
         In conclusion, it shows post-operative procalcitonin is better marker to predict post-operative
         infectious complications after pancreatic surgeries and post-operative day 3 procalcitonin has
         highest diagnostic accuracy.
