Abstract

Body perceptual disturbances are an increasingly acknowledged set of symptoms and possible clinical

markers of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), but the neurophysiological and

neurocognitive changes that underlie them are still far from being clear. We adopted a novel

multivariate and neurodynamical approach to the analysis of EEG modulations evoked by touch, to

highlight differences between patients and healthy controls, between affected and unaffected side of

the body, and between “passive” (i.e. no task demands and equiprobable digit stimulation) and

“active” tactile processing (i.e. where a digit discrimination task was administered and spatial

probability manipulated). Contrary to our expectations we found no support for early differences in

neural processing between CRPS and healthy participants, however, there was increased decodability

in the CRPS group compared to healthy volunteers between 280 and 320 ms after stimulus onset.

This group difference seemed to be driven by the affected rather than the unaffected side and was

enhanced by attentional demands. These results found support in the exploratory analysis of neural

representation dynamics and behavioural modelling, highlighting the need for single participant

analyses. Although several limitations impacted the robustness and generalizability of our

comparisons, the proposed novel analytical approach yielded promising insights (as well as possible

biomarkers based on neural dynamics) into the relatively unexplored alterations of tactile decision-

making and attentional control mechanisms in chronic CRPS.

Introduction

Body perception is a fundamental ingredient of human conscious experience (Ehrsson et al., 2004;

Lenggenhager et al., 2007; Blanke et al., 2015) and a strikingly relevant aspect of such experience,

especially when we are in pain. A growing number of neuroimaging studies and neurocognitive

models are starting to uncover the complex, multilevel, system of interactions between cortical and

subcortical brain areas and afferent somatosensory information, that underpin body perception during

pain (e.g., (Woo et al., 2017; Mouraux & Iannetti, 2018)). As it is often the case, peculiar distortions

of body perception that emerge in certain chronic pain conditions, have sparked precious insights into

the complexities of this important brain function. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a

debilitating and poorly understood condition, in which disproportionate pain and a variable

combination of other symptoms follows an apparently minor injury to one of the limbs (Bruehl, 2015;

Birklein et al., 2018). Although this eerie “unilateral” pain condition has raised fascination and

perplexity for decades, its etiology and treatment remain elusive, also because of the disarming

heterogeneity of its clinical presentation (Marinus et al., 2011). In recent years, the observation of a

disparate and peculiar set of disturbances in body perception (Lewis & Schweinhardt, 2012) (e.g.,

finger misperception) (Förderreuther et al., 2004; Kuttikat et al., 2017) in some of these patients has

tilted the investigation of the pathophysiology of the disease towards possible (structural and

functional) cortical changes in somatosensory brain regions (Swart et al., 2009). The initial idea,

developed in analogy to other pain conditions such as phantom limb or chronic back pain (Flor et al.,

1995; Flor et al., 1997; Bray & Moseley, 2011), was that misperception symptoms could result from

CRPS-induced maladaptive plasticity (i.e. cortical reorganization) in the contralateral primary

sensory cortex (S1) (Maihöfner et al., 2004; Pleger et al., 2004). However, the few neuroimaging

studies conducted so far have led to contradicting results, spanning from a similar representation of

affected and unaffected sides of the body, to an enlarged (rather than shrunk) representation of the

affected limb onto S1 (Di Pietro et al., 2013; Di Pietro et al., 2015; van Velzen et al., 2016; Mancini

et al., 2019; Pfannmöller et al., 2019). However, as recently pointed out by some authors (Kuttikat et

al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020), most work on CRPS-related body misperception (mirroring the larger

branch of body perception research) has traditionally focused on early, more “physiological”

components of somatosensory processing (i.e. < 50 ms; e.g., (Pleger et al., 2004; Lenz et al., 2011)),

relying on experimental architectures that are more concerned with stimulation precision rather than

its ecological validity. Yet, later-latency, more “cognitive” factors such as attentional modulation and

perceptual decision making have long been known to modify somatosensation (Mima et al., 1998;

Franz et al., 2015), including that of pain (Bantick et al., 2002; Chan et al., 2012; Clauwaert et al.,

2020) and, the growing evidence of executive dysfunction in CRPS (Apkarian et al., 2004; Geha et

al., 2008; Lee et al., 2015), led some to suggest that the contradictory patterns of neural representation

alterations emerging from CRPS literature could be partially explained by differential cognitive and

attentional engagement elicited different paradigms.

Besides these conceptual limitations, studies on CRPS-related functional plasticity are guilty of a

number of further methodological issues, namely, for instance, the lack of adequate spatial resolution

and accuracy of the currently available source reconstruction methods (Maihöfner et al., 2003;

Kuttikat et al., 2016) and the limited sensitivity offered by average-based signal analysis techniques

such as ERPs. Indeed, classical (univariate) ERP analyses by definition mask the variability across

subjects in order to let similarities emerge (Luck, 2005), but individual differences in patterns of

activation do exist and, especially for more heterogeneous groups of people, like CRPS patients

definitely are, group contrasts are easily overwhelmed by the amount of inter-individual noise.

Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA; or “brain decoding”) is gaining exponential popularity in the

world of cognitive (and clinical) neuroscience, thanks to the promise of increased sensitivity and

reduced reliance on “spatially variant” confounds such us, e.g., anatomical differences in the folding

pattern of the cortex (King & Dehaene, 2014; Grootswagers et al., 2017). MVPA offers additional

advantages when investigating the temporo-spatial dynamics of pain processing (Rosa & Seymour,

2014) and it has successfully been used to decode pain experience and sensitivity in heathy volunteers

(Schulz et al., 2011; Tu et al., 2014; Lancaster et al., 2017). However, applications of decoding

techniques to EEG signals (that are conveniently portable, cheap, and offer excellent temporal

precision) have never been used in combination with attentional demand manipulations to study

(painful) somatosensation in healthy humans, nor in any clinical setting, at least to our knowledge.

Hence, we aimed at investigating the influence of attentional modulation on CRPS-related perceptual

alterations, by using multivariate pattern classification of early, mid-latency and late EEG activity

elicited by tactile digit stimulation and recognition. We exploited MVPA methodological advantages

to better reflect and leverage individual patterns of “neural information” and highlight differences

between CRPS patients and healthy volunteers (HV) and between the affected and unaffected side in

individual patients. We did so not only during “rest” (i.e. passive stimulation) but also under increased

“cognitive” demands (i.e. active condition, where spatial probability was manipulated, and a digit

discrimination task was administered). As per our hypotheses (https://osf.io/rmhsb), we expected:

H.1. A main effect of group (CRPS < HV) on mean performance in distinguishing the five fingers

      from each other (i.e. all-vs-all decoding).

H.2. An interaction of group by side (left and right) on all-vs-all finger classifier accuracy, in the

      direction of smaller difference between hands in the HV group.

H.3. A main effect of side (affected < unaffected) on classifier performance for brain activity elicited

      by stimulation of the thumb (D1) vs. the little finger (D5) (i.e. 1-vs-5 decoding), across

      conditions (passive and active stimulation), in any of the CRPS patients.

H.4. An interaction of condition by side-affected on 1-vs-5 decoding accuracy, such that, in the

      active but not in the passive condition the performance in the affected hand will be comparable

      to that of the healthy (unaffected) hand.

Despite their mostly descriptive and exploratory nature, we believe our results shed important insight

into the possible neurophysiological and neurocognitive basis of tactile misperceptions reported in

CRPS, opening a window for a conceptually and methodologically new approach to this field of

investigation.

Materials and methods

Participants

Our sample included 13 patients (11 females, mean(range) age = 46.8(30-63) years) who were

diagnosed with unilateral upper or lower limb CRPS according to modified Budapest Research

Criteria (Harden et al., 2007) and 13 age and sex matched healthy volunteers (11 females,

mean(range) age = 45.0(28-63) years). All participants (patients and healthy volunteers) were right-

handed. Exclusion criteria were: previous or current diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy, stroke,

transient ischemic attack, multiple sclerosis, malignancy or seizure disorder.

Ethical standards

All participants gave written and informed consent to take part in the study and were remunerated for

their time. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of East of England-South

Cambridge (REC Ref No: 12/EE/0305) and it conforms with the World Medical Association

Declaration of Helsinki (2013). All possible measures were taken to minimize pain or discomfort in

all participants, with a special attention to the CRPS group. All patients were advised to report

immediately if the sensation was uncomfortable or painful and the fingertips were also checked after

each session for any redness of the skin. After every block of sensory stimulation, a break of at least

10 seconds (in the passive condition) or a few minutes (in the active condition) was offered to improve

participants’ comfort.

Study design

Two custom-made handboxes (one for each hand) were calibrated to deliver soft touch stimuli with

the same force to the fingertips of each digit. The experiment, as depicted in Figure 1, consisted of 4

blocks of passive stimulation (i.e. passive condition), followed by 8 blocks of finger recognition task

(i.e. active condition). In the passive condition, participants were instructed sit relaxed and keep their

eyes closed head still as much as possible. In each passive block, 50 touches were delivered in random

order to each finger of one hand. Left and right hand were alternated between blocks, for a total of

500 trials per hand (100 for each finger). In the active condition, participants placed one hand on the

handbox, with their eyes still closed and a relaxed but still posture; again, hands were alternated

between blocks. This time, participants were asked to respond to the stimulation by saying out loud

the number corresponding to the stimulated finger (i.e. thumb = 1, index finger = 2, middle finger =

3, ring finger = 4 and little finger = 5) and a bottom-up manipulation of predictability was

implemented, with outer fingers (D1 and D5, i.e. “expected”) being touched on 75% of all trials,

whereas the probability of stimulation for central fingers (D2, D3 or D4, i.e., “rare” / “oddball”

fingers) was 25%. The answer was recorded manually by the experimenter thereby triggering the next

stimulus. Each active block consisted of 80 trials, for a total of 320 stimulations for each hand (120

to each thumb, 120 to each little finger, and ~27 each for the remaining three rare fingers).

EEG acquisition and preprocessing

During both conditions, 128-channel high-density EEG data were collected using the Net Amps 300

amplifier (Electrical Geodesics Inc., Oregon, USA), at the sampling frequency of 250 Hz. Raw data

were pre-processed in MATLAB using the EEGLAB toolbox (Delorme & Makeig, 2004) and in-

house scripts. Channels on the neck, cheeks and forehead were removed, leaving 92 retained channels

for further analysis. EEG data were filtered between 0.5 and 30Hz and epoched between -200ms and

800ms relative to stimulation onset. Artefacts originating from eye blinks, eye or muscle movements

and electrical interference were identified and removed by means of visual inspection and

independent component analysis (ICA). After the interpolation of rejected channels, data were re-

referenced to the average and baseline-corrected relative to a 200ms interval before the stimulation.

For each participant, single-subject ERP plots were examined to ensure data quality.

MVPA and Statistical Analysis

Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) on EEG data was implemented using MATLAB-based

ADAM toolbox (Fahrenfort et al., 2018). We employed a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

algorithm to perform decoding (Grootswagers et al., 2017) and a 10-fold stratified cross-validation

method was implemented to prevent overfitting. Hence, we ran the classification 10 times; each time

the LDA model was fit (or “trained”) on 9/10 of the total number of trials, leaving the remaining 10%

for testing. The procedure was then repeated for each time point in the trial. Imbalances within and

between classes resulting from noisy trial rejection and/or experimental manipulations were corrected

by means of undersampling. Brain decoding was performed first at a “super-subject” level for both

(active and passive) conditions. A super-subject was built by “stacking” together all trials from all

healthy volunteers, regardless of who performed them. The resulting “super-block” was then analysed

as a single subject dataset, following the procedure described above. Super-subject classifier

performance was calculated for each finger (against all others) individually, averaged across the

resulting five time-courses and used to select the time window(s) of interest for subsequent analysis,

according to cluster-based permutation testing with significance level of 0.05. For the “all-vs-all”

analysis, a multi-class LDA was trained to assign the input brain pattern to one of five finger classes

(D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5). To quantify the decoding performance, Classification Accuracy (CA) was

calculated per class, by averaging across the 10 folds (at each time-point), then averaged across

classes and compared to the random classification rate (RCR), defined as the reciprocal of the number

of classes (i.e. 20%). For the “1-vs-5” analysis, a linear classifier was fit to the trials corresponding

to stimulation of the thumb (D1) and little finger (D5) in both conditions and hands of the CRPS

group. Classifier performance was measured using Area Under the Curve (AUC), a nonparametric

criterion-free measure of generalization (Grootswagers et al., 2017). To asses statistical significance

(hypothesis H.1 and H.2), the selected time-windows of “all-vs-all” decoding output for the two

groups and sides were compared using a Linear Mixed Model with “side” (affected vs unaffected),

“group” (CRPS vs HV) and their interaction estimated as fixed effects, whereas the intercept values

were allowed to vary across subjects (i.e. random coefficient). Because the difference between active

and passive activations became evident in later stages of processing, we examined it by adding a main

effect of condition among the fixed coefficients of the model. Finally, to test hypothesis H.3 and H.4,

each patients’ data was compared in a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA featuring side (affected

and unaffected) and condition (passive and active) as main factors. Statistical analysis was

implemented in R and Jamovi (Şahin & Aybek, 2019) and a p-value <.05 was considered statistically

significant.

Exploratory analysis

To explore whether the trends detected by our analysis would mirror any differences in the actual

behavioral choices of our participants in the finger recognition task, we calculated d’ (d-prime) and

bias (c) scores by opposing “expected” (D1 and D5) and “rare” (D2-D4) digits. Originally borrowed

from Signal Detection Theory (SDT), d’ and c are meant to decompose response behavior in order to

capture the individual’s sensitivity (i.e., the ability to distinguish the two alternative sensory signals)

and his/her “decision criterion”, providing an indication of any “preference” for one or the other

answer (Wickens, 2002; Macmillan & Creelman, 2004; Bang & Rahnev, 2017). In our case, c is

expected to reflect the effect of expectation induced by digit probability manipulation. In other words,

an “optimal” decision criterion would be slightly displaced towards negative values, as responses “1”

and “5” are more probably correct and therefore “preferred” over “2”, “3” or “4”. The same model

used for group-level analysis of classifier output was adopted to predict both these scores (i.e., a

Linear Mixed Model with side, group and their interaction estimated as fixed effects, whereas the

intercept of each subject as a random coefficient).

We also assessed the temporal stability/mutability of these finger mental representations in the two

groups, conditions, and sides of the body, by applying Temporal Generalization Analysis (TGA), a

decoding technique that, instead of training and testing a classifier on data from a single timepoint at

the time as we described above, tests each classifier trained on time t using all other timepoints in the

trial (King & Dehaene, 2014). If the same pattern of information (e.g., the representation of a finger)

recurs at multiple time points, that pattern is deemed stable. If the generalizability is low despite

above-chance decoding, then the neural information that supports such decoding is likely not as stable

but rather it evolves dynamically across time.

Results

Healthy “super-subject” results

We defined the temporal regions of interest with the mean “super-subject” classifier (illustrated in

Figure 2). This analysis showed a performance reliably better than chance within three temporal

clusters: between 28 and 56 ms (peak: 40 ms) and between 84 and 128 ms (peak: 112 ms) after

stimulus onset in the passive condition; and between 364 and 500 ms (peak: 480 ms) after stimulus

onset in the active condition. The same temporal patterns appeared when all-vs-all and a 1-vs-5

decoder were trained and tested on the same healthy “super-subject” data. We therefore selected an

“early” (28-56 ms), “mid” (84-128 ms) and “late” (364-500 ms) time windows for statistical testing.

We cautiously decided to include a fourth “mid-late” time window, extending from 180 to 320 ms

after stimulus presentation, as a large peak in decoding performance seems to be present in the active

condition (Figure 2D), potentially relevant for cognitive processing.

Group-level results

The performance (i.e. CA) time-courses of the all-vs-all decoder is represented in Figure 3. For each

subject, we selected four temporal clusters of CA values (early, mid, mid-late and late time windows)

and averaged CA across time within those windows. Within the same windows the peak (highest

performance value) and its latency were also registered and analysed for exploration purposes. All

results including F-values for each comparison, their associated p-values and effect sizes are reported

in Table 1.

We found little evidence supporting our first hypothesis – i.e. lower mean decoding performance in

the CRPS group compared to controls – in any of the four time-windows. An effect in the predicted

direction was present in the early time-window only, but not to a significant extent (F1,24=2.96,

P=0.098, η2p=0.054). Notably however, a reliable effect of group, in the opposite direction compared

to our predictions (i.e., CRPS > HV) emerged in the mid-late time-window of 180-320ms (F1,24=7.37,

P=0.012, η2p=0.095), further corroborated by exploratory analysis of peak performance (F1,24=8.66,

P=0.007, η2p=0.095). There was no support for our second hypothesis – H.2 –, stating a larger

difference between hands in the CRPS group compared to HV. A small but reliable interaction of

group by side emerged in the early time window (F1,24=5.39, P=0.029, η2p=0.041), CA was slightly

higher (0.01 point increase) in the left hand compared to the right one for healthy volunteers, and

slightly lower (0.02 point decrease) on the side affected by CRPS compared to the unaffected one in

the patient group.

An expected result not formally stated a priori was the effect of attention. The decoders trained on

the active condition performing reliably better than the passive ones in the two later time windows

(F1,51=75.40, P<0.001, η2p=0.387; F1,75=94.92, P<0.001, η2p=0.429).

Individual-level results

The subject-wise differences between the two sides (affected and unaffected) in each condition and

timeframe are summarised in Figure 4, and all statistical results (including F-values, p-values and

effect sizes) are fully reported in Table 2.

There was no reliable effect for our third hypothesis of better performance in the unaffected side

compared to the painful one. We found an effect of side in the predicted direction for H.3 in 3 of 13

patients (F1,9= 7.80, P=0.021, η²p=0.464; F1,9=5.72, P=0.040, η²p=0.388; F1,9=7.77, P=0.021,

η²p=0.463). None of the 13 participants affected by CRPS showed interactions as we hypothesized in

H.4, however, in 6/13 of the patients’ results showed the “shape” in the predicted direction. An effect

of side leaning in the opposite direction with respect to our prediction (i.e., the affected side

performing better than the healthy one) was present in two other patients (F1,9=12.21, P=0.007,

η²p=0.576; F1,9=5.54, P=0.043, η²p=0.381), one of which also showed an interaction of side by

condition (F1,9=21.24, P=0.001, η²p=0.702), but in the opposite direction to our hypothesis H.4.

Exploratory results

The Temporal Generalization matrices resulting from our exploratory TGA within the two groups,

sides and conditions are represented in Figure 5. The first considerable difference that stands out (by

contrasting Figures 5A, C and E to Figures 5B, D and F) is how information processing changes

radically when task demands are introduced in the active condition. While during passive stimulation

(5A-C-E) a more diagonal-shaped decoding performance indicates neural patterns that generalize

over a brief, transient time period only, higher levels of temporal generalition emerge during the

active condition (5B-D-F), suggesting cortical signals (or mental representations) that are

“mantained” more stably actross time. Secondly, when we focus on the active processing differences

between sides of the body, i.e. unaffected (5B) and affected (5D) by the CRPS, is noticeable how,

while the unaffected side shows a generalization pattern that is comparable to that of healthy

volunteers (5F), with a more widespread decodability expanding to timepoints that even preced

sitimulus onset, the affected side TGA seems to yield a narrower and “delayed” spread of finger

neural representation.

With respect to the behavioral variables (represented in Figure 6), a significant main effect of group

(F1,24=5.83, P=0.024, η2p=0.158) and side (F1,24=12.63, P=0.002, η2p=0.065) emerged on d’ scores.

Sensitivity scores were 0.48 SDs higher on average on the unaffected / dominant hand compared to

the contralateral one, and 0.70 units lower in CRPS patients compared to the HV group. Even though

the interaction effect was not reliable (F1,24=0.54, P=0.470, η2p=0.003), the difference in performance

between the two hands (i.e., affected < unaffected) was higher in the CRPS group (F1,24=9.20,

P=0.006), compared to that of healthy volunteers (F1,24=3.97, P=0.058). With respect to the bias (c)

score, none of the fixed effect included in the model did yield significant results (Group effect:

F1,24=3.27, P=0.083 η2p=0.078; Side: F1,24=2.42, P=0.133, η2p=0.020; Group ✻ Side: F1,24=0.82,

groups’ behavioral prerfomance was really in the accentuated spread or variability of such measures

across the patients’ group compared to healthy controls.


Discussion

We did not find consistent support for a worse tactile decoding performance in the CRPS group

compared to healthy controls, nor for a greater decodability gap between hands in these patients in

any of our time windows of interest (H.1 and H.2). In addition, three patients showed a significantly

worse classification performance on the affected (compared to the unaffected) side of the body (H.3),

but none of our patients presented the expected reduction of decodability gap between hands during

the active task, compared to the passive stimulation (H.4). Nonetheless, the adoption of time series

MVPA has proven useful novel tool for the investigation of tactile processing differences induced by

CRPS. It is encouraging to notice, for instance, how the “super-subject” decoding time-course did

yield similar “peaks” to those often reported in in classical somatosensory ERP research: the earliest

cortical components emerging between 20-80ms, followed by a N1-like wave (commonly observed

around 80-120 ms) (Luck, 2005) can be appreciated in both conditions (Figure 2). These results lend

further support to the thesis that CRPS does not show changes in the fine grained cortical

somatotopies (Mancini et al., 2019). These two early modulations are meant to mirror the more

“physiological” aspects of sensory processing, tracking afferent inputs from peripheral nerves into

primary cortical areas (S1; <50ms (Lueders et al., 1983; Wood et al., 1988)), and from there to

secondary processing stages (S2; >80ms), building up to the (yet unconscious) detection of sensory

stimuli (Schubert et al., 2006; Schubert et al., 2008; Garrido et al., 2009; Chennu et al., 2013).

Interestingly, when an attentional modulation is introduced by task demands in the active condition

(Figure 2B and 2D) two further and wider performance peaks emerge between 250 and 500 ms

(Figure 2B), strongly resembling the notorious P3 (a and b) modulation (Polich, 2007).

A disease-induced “temporal dragging” of sensory information processing

This latter “P3-like” task-induced attentional modulation constitutes a statistically robust effect that

emerged from our analysis and we argue that these later-latency, more “cognitive” stages of

processing, ultimately may be the ones that enshrine the key to perceptual differences induced by

chronic CRPS. Indeed, the amount of neural information detected by our classifiers was abnormally

enhanced (rather the reduced) in the CRPS group between 180 and 320 ms after the touch has been

delivered (Figure 3B). This result, in line with the prior analysis of this same dataset (Kuttikat et al.,

2018) as well as other recent theoretical accounts (Brown et al., 2020), suggests that later (“P2 / P3-

like”) components of processing, supporting higher cognitive functions such as attentional allocation

and perceptual decision-making, assume greater importance in CRPS patients compared to controls.

This arguably “compensatory” shift in the temporal distribution of tactile information processing, i.e.,

a relative dampening of early performance peaks followed by heavier reliance on later processing, is

evident not only in the active condition (Figure 3B), but also to a lesser extent during passive

stimulation. Indeed, by looking at the decoding output in Figure 3A one can notice how two lower

performance peaks in CRPS (vs. HV) round ⁓50 and ⁓100 ms are followed by a “dragging” of

decoding sustained over 200-250 ms into the trial, when HV decoder is already at chance. This

observation also matches previous evidence of greater amplitude of mid-late ERP components in

CRPS patients (Kuttikat et al., 2018) and potentially signals further processing or delays of sensory

sensation leaking into central cognitive control or awareness. The passive “dragging effect” emerges

again from TGA (Figure 5A and C vs. Figure 5E), stressing again how in CRPS patients compared

to HVs, a shade of relevant finger information does persist beyond basic sensory processing stages,

despite no instructions are currently deeming that information useful to fulfil any higher-level task.

An affected-side-specific “temporal shift” into later processing stages

Although the effect of side as we expected it (affected < unaffected) did not reach a robust statistical

support neither at the group nor at an individual level, when zooming into the decodability time-

courses corresponding to the affected and unaffected sides of the body (Figure 3E and 3F) some

interesting patterns emerge. In the passive condition for instance (Figure 3E), one could notice how

the above mentioned “dragging” of performance around 200-250 ms in the CRPS group (Figure 3A)

seems to be mostly driven by the affected side, rather than by the unaffected counterpart. This

affected-side-specific docking of neural information onto a time-frame that is thought to underlie

more cognitive stages of processing (rather than early perceptual/sensory), stresses again the idea that

more advanced and abstract aspects of perception may be altered by the disease, especially on the

side of the body that is directly affected by it. Similarly, in the active condition (Figure 3F), one can

appreciate how the CRPS-related dampening of the first peak in Figure 3B (⁓50 ms, supposedly

underlying poorer primary somatosensory processing, and mirrored in the passive condition in Figure

3A and 3E) seems to originate again more from the affected rather than the unaffected side of the

body. Interestingly, the exploratory analysis of the temporal dynamics of processing in the affected

and unaffected sides of CRPS patients (Figure 5B and 5D) helped highlighting a considerable

temporal shift in finger representation that seems specific to the affected side, but could not emerge

by simple diagonal (i.e., transient) decodability (Figure 3F). More research is needed to clarify these

side-specific dynamics of perceptual information processing in CRPS, but here we highlight a

potentially crucial role of attentional demands in such distinction (Bultitude et al., 2017).

Intersubject variability: an issue and a resource

Besides the underappreciated role of later stages of processing in CRPS-related somatosensory

misperceptions, the second most consistent result emerging from our analysis is that of a substantial

inter-subject variability in the CRPS group. We snapshot this variability in Figure 4, by representing

the mean decoding difference between the two hands (i.e., “decodability imbalance”) in each

participant, condition, and time-window. There, while healthy volunteers (Figure 4B) are more

consistent in showing a slightly better performance on the dominant hand across conditions and time-

frames (with higher imbalances early in the trial quickly resolved after 80ms), CRPS patients show

less overlap between conditions and a less consistent pattern across the group and across time.

Interestingly, behavioral results point again to a more variable picture in the CRPS group compared

to HVs. Even though patients did show lower sensitivity (d’) scores than controls on average (Figure

6A), most of the variability in d’ scores was due to interindividual variability rather than any of the

fixed effects in the model, and by inspecting Figure 6C, one can appreciate how the spread of d’

values is relatively larger in the CRPS group compared to controls. Similarly, while the expected

negative criterion shift (Bang & Rahnev, 2017) is consistently present across healthy participants,

CRPS patients’ decisional process seems much less consistent (Figure 6B and 6D) and overall less

finely tuned to statistical optimality (Brown et al., 2020). In light of this issue, future analyses oriented

towards leveraging rather than silencing these inter-individual differences, can greatly contribute to

our understanding of misperception phenomena in CRPS.

Theoretical interpretation: Hierarchical Predictive Coding

The journey of CRPS through possible theoretical explanations and framings has been a troubled one

(Feliu & Edwards, 2010; Borchers & Gershwin, 2014; Popkirov et al., 2019). Most recently, some

authors began to appeal to the idea that, in order to understand the complex and subtle perceptual

phenomena accompanying the disease, an articulated and thorough model of human perception needs

to be taken into account (Kuttikat et al., 2016; Kuttikat et al., 2018; Popkirov et al., 2019; Brown et

al., 2020). If we model the human brain (including that of CRPS patients) under a framework that

regards its mechanisms as a complex, hierarchical – possibly Bayesian – structure, we can then

assume perception is simultaneously and dynamically influenced not only by afferent inputs and

forward sensory processing steps but also by higher-level knowledge. In a nutshell, this long-standing

perspective, often referred to as Hierarchical Predictive Coding (HPC) models (Friston, 2018),

proposes that information accumulated and distilled from prior experiences is constantly used to

predict or “explain away” new sensory inputs; if the new experience is completely conforming to

such expectations, no further processing is needed, but when something surprising (i.e., not matching

the existing prediction) is present in the incoming sensory stream, a residual prediction error is

generated. These errors propagate forward in the system and are used to update the expectations and

improve future predictions, i.e., learning (Feldman & Friston, 2010). Two aspects of HPC theories

are relevant when trying to understand tactile misperceptions in CRPS. One hypothesis is that

ambiguity in sensory input (resulting for instance from sensory nerve pathology in some forms of

CRPS) biases perception towards expectations, implying an abnormally strong influence of cognitive

predictions on perception. Some evidence pointing in this direction is that lower frequency bands

(e.g., delta and theta ranges) of brain activity, thought to underlie top-down predictions, show greater

spectral power across frontal and somatosensory cortices in CRPS patients compared to controls

(Walton et al., 2010). The same idea also finds moderate support in our group-level decoding output

(Figure 3A and 3B), where an initial lesser decodability in the CRPS (vs. HV) in the first (⁓50ms)

peaks, is inverted in later time frames (after ⁓180ms; our mid-late time-window). Zooming into the

active identification task, a heavier reliance on expectancy-related information could be a plausible

explanation of the group gain in classifier performance (Figure 3B) as well as the affected-side

specific delay in establishing a stable finger mental representation to support digit identification

(Figure 5D). This “shift” of processing (described above) could be interpreted as a “compensatory”

mechanism, that leverages the intact top-down neural structure to a newly lesioned and inefficient

afferent stream, but, an internal model of the world that is less efficient to the incoming information

ultimately becomes too rigid and bound to miss the optimal interpretation of such sensory input.

Indeed, our behavioral exploration showed a much less uniform estimated displacement of decision

criterion (c; Figure 6B and 6D) in the patient group, and this was especially true for the affected side

of the body. CRPS patients’ perceptual decisions were less tuned towards the optimal value with

respect to the real probability of stimulation (Bang & Rahnev, 2017) and this idea echoes with other

similar but independent analyses of CRPS-related changes in perceptual predictions (Brown et al.,

2020). Altogether, the picture that seems to emerge is that of a lack of balance between top-down and

bottom-up influences on perception, which brings us to the other key player in this complex Bayesian

game of perception: attention. In the HPC framework, attention (or “salience”) serves as a balance-

control system, enhancing or dampening the influence of the other model components (bottom-up or

top-down signals) according to the respective “precision” weights, i.e., degree of certainty (Chennu

et al., 2013; Moran et al., 2013). This could be relevant to CRPS research, for two reasons. First, pain

(especially chronic pain) is known to drain attentional resources from other parallel processes (Dick

et al., 2003) thereby impairing identification performance on the affected, but also potentially on the

unaffected side. Second, a lack of attention (or precision) on the affected side could prevail in patients

with more severe cognitive neglect-like symptoms (Kuttikat et al., 2016; Wittayer et al., 2018),

resulting in worse top-down/bottom-up balancing on the affected rather than the unaffected side. This

potentially concurring antagonist mechanisms could explain why, despite an affected-side specific

delay in processing was evident from TGA outcomes (Figure 5B-D) the difference between sides in

terms of behavioral (Figure 6) and diagonal decoding performances (Figure 3F) was less clear and

inconsistent across the patient group, as emerged from the individual-level statistical results as well.

Conclusion

Altogether, the puzzle of symptoms and neural information patters characterizing this enigmatic

condition seems to point to a difficulty with the body mental representation (Kuttikat et al., 2016;

Halicka et al., 2020), rather than a mere deficit in peripheral transmission (Yvon et al., 2018) or

modifications of cortical somatotopies (Mancini et al, 2019). Expectancy-related and attentional

aspects of sensory processing deserve more investigation as contributing mechanisms to CRPS

perceptual disturbances, a combination of novel decoding techniques and computational models such

as HPC may be a useful toolset for understanding the cognitive and pathophysiological changes

related to them. More research is needed to clarify side-specific and general dynamics of perceptual

information processing in CRPS, ideally supported by principled experimental design and guided by

the ultimate goal to leverage individual differences to boost understanding, prevention and treatment

of the disorder.

During the study visit, participants gave written informed consent and were sitting comfortably as the EEG

cap was placed and prepared for recording. The handboxes (in the picture above) were then calibrated to deliver

soft touch stimuli with the same force to the fingertips of each digit and soft ear plugs were provided to reduce

any external auditory input and help participants focusing on the tactile stimuli. (A) In the passive condition

the order of digit stimulation was randomised within each block (on each hand in turn). Touches were delivered

at a predefined frequency of 1Hz (duration: 50ms; ISI: 950ms). Each of the 4 (~5 minutes-long) blocks

contained 250 trials (50 stimulations per digit), for a total of 1000 trials (500 per hand and 100 per individual

fingers) in ~20 minutes. A 10 seconds break after was offered after every block to improve participant’s

comfort. (B) In the active condition, digit stimulation was pseudo-randomised in each hand / block, with D1

and D5 receiving 30 stimulations each (probability = 37.5%), for a total of 240 touches each across the two

hands (120 on the left and 120 on the right). The inner digits (D2, D3 and D4) shared the remaining 20 trials

of each block (probability = 8.3%), reaching ~54 stimulations each across the two hands (~27 on each hand).

Hence, of the total 640 active trials, 480 were dedicated to “expected” fingers (D1 and D5) and 160 to the

“rare” central fingers (D2-D4). A microphone attached to the EMG recording was used to capture the

participant’s reaction time (resulting from the subtraction of the stimulus onset time from the start of the voice

deflection on the EMG). The answer was recorded manually by the experimenter by typing the number on the

computer and triggering the next stimulus. A maximum time lock was set on three seconds per trial.

A, B. The average time-course of five one-vs-all classifiers trained and tested on the healthy “super-subject”

data in the passive (A) and active (B) condition. The portion of time that survived cluster-based permutation

test for significance against chance is highlighted with a thicker line. C, D. The decoding time-course of the

all-vs-all classifier applied to the passive (C) and active (D) super-subject data, with the four time-windows

(A) Decoding performance (CA) as a function of time, resulting from training and testing two all-vs-all

the time-course of the same two all-vs-all classifiers trained on the active condition, for healthy controls (in

yellow) and CRPS patients (in red). (C) the passive and (D) active time-courses of classification performance

on the left (in pink) and on the right hand (in light green) in the HV group only. (E) the passive and (F) active

decoding performance time-course on the affected (in red) and on the unaffected side (in dark green) of the

CRPS group only. In all of the above plots, the portion of time where classifier performed significantly better

chance (RCR = 20%) was established by means of t-test (i.e., uncorrected p-values > 0.05) is highlighted with

a thicker line. The output of MVPA applied to successive time points, as pictured in the six graphs, is meant

to describe when and for how long the information of interest, i.e., the identity of the finger that is being

touched, becomes “encoded” or “represented” explicitly in the brain (Grootswagers et al., 2017).

Figure 1 – INTERINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY




(A) Variability within the CRPS group. The four bar plots represent the subject-wise differences in mean

decoding performance score between affected and unaffected side of the body (affected – unaffected), or

“decodability imbalance”, across the early, mid, mid-late and late time-window. For each patient, two

decodability imbalances are drawn for the passive (in blue) and for the active condition (in red). When these

two bars overlap, the decodability imbalance will be similar (in direction and amplitude) among the two

conditions. Patients that had higher decoding performance on the unaffected compared to the affected side

(following our expectations) will show negative decodability imbalance values (on the left side of each graph:

affected < unaffected), whereas those for whom the opposite was true (accuracy in the affected side was higher

than the healthy side) will report positive decodability imbalances, hence leaning towards the right of each

graph (affected > unaffected). (B) Decodability imbalances between left and right hand of HVs were also

reported for comparison. Here, imbalances in the passive condition are represented in cyan, whereas the active

condition is reported in pink. Analogously, volunteers who showed higher decoding performance on the right

compared to the left side (as expected) will have negative decodability imbalance values (on the left side of

each graph), whereas left > right outcomes result in positive decodability differences (on the right of each

graph).

Figure 5 – TEMPORAL GENERALIZATION ANALYSIS




Temporal generalization matrices representing the generalization across time for (A) CRPS patients’

unaffected side of body in the passive condition, and (B) their unaffected side data in the active condition; (C)

CRPS patients’ side affected by the disease in the passive condition, and (D) their affected side data during

the active condition. Healthy volunteers’ temporal generalizations are also plotted for comparison in the (E)

passive condition, and (F) in the active condition. In each of the six graphs, training timepoints are represented

on the y-axis, while testing timepoints are displayed on the x-axis and two dashed lines locate the time of

tactile stimulus onset in both dimensions. Color indicates decoder’s performance strength (i.e., classification

accuracy). The diagonal values (from the left bottom to top right) closely correspond to the outcome computed

in the previous analysis (represented in Figure 3E, 3F and 3A, 3B). Higher off-diagonal performance indicates

stronger temporal generalization (i.e., stability of neural representations).

Figure 6 – BEHAVIORAL RESULTS




(A, B) Bar plots representing the subject-wise (A) d’ score and (B) bias scores calculated between digits 1-5

(“expected fingers”) and 2-3-4 (“rare fingers”). The affected / non-dominant side is represented in red / pink

(for CRPS and HV respectively), and in the unaffected / dominant side is represented in dark / light green (for

CRPS and HV respectively). The bars representing CRPS patients’ values are drawn on top of the HV values,

ordered from lowest to highest value. (C) distribution of d’ scores in the two sides of HV and CRPS (above

and below respectively). (D) distribution of c (bias) scores in the two groups and hands. The same color scheme

was adopted (red for affected / non-dominant and green for unaffected / dominant) and the two transversal

lines provide a representation of the side-specific mean difference between groups.
