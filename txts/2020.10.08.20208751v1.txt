    Abstract (Word count 233/250)
    Background
    Little is known regarding the full spectrum of illness among children with SARS-CoV-2 infection
    across ambulatory and inpatient settings.
    Methods
    Active surveillance was performed for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction among
    asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals in a quaternary care academic hospital laboratory in
    Tennessee from March 12-July 17, 2020. For symptomatic patients ≤18 years of age, we
    performed phone follow-up and medical record review to obtain sociodemographic and clinical
    data on days 2, 7, and 30 after diagnosis and on day 30 for asymptomatic patients ≤18 years.
    Daily and 7-day average test positivity frequencies were calculated for children and adults
    beginning April 26, 2020.
    Results
    SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 531/10327 (5.1%) specimens from patients ≤18 years, including
    46/5752 (0.8%) asymptomatic and 485/4575 (10.6%) specimens from 459 unique symptomatic
    children. Cough (51%), fever (42%), and headache (41%) were the most common symptoms
    associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization was uncommon
    (18/459 children; 4%); no children with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period required
    intensive care unit admission. Symptom resolution occurred by follow-up day 2 in 192/459
    (42%), by day 7 in 332/459 (72%), and by day 30 in 373/396 (94%). The number of cases and
    percent positivity rose in late June and July in all ages.
    Conclusions
    In an integrated healthcare network, most pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections were mild, brief, and
    rarely required hospital admission, despite increasing cases as community response measures
    were relaxed.

    Background (Word count 2996/3000)
              Emerging reports suggest that the clinical features and outcomes associated with SARS-
    CoV-2 infection may have important differences across the age spectrum.[1-5] The spectrum of
    illness reported to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is broad, including
    asymptomatic viral detection, and features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), typically
    characterized by respiratory symptoms, fever, and sometimes other symptoms such as
    diarrhea, headache, and anosmia.[3, 6, 7] The severity of illness has been reported to range
    from mild, transient symptoms to illness requiring hospitalization, intensive respiratory support,
    and even rarely death in children. More recently, reports have emerged of a severe
    inflammatory syndrome occurring in the weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure in
    children,[8, 9] now known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).[10] This
    syndrome shares many features with toxic shock syndrome, another condition associated with
    multisystem organ dysfunction.[11] Some cases demonstrate clinical findings similar to
    Kawasaki disease, although MIS-C patients often have lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia and
    examination findings concerning for acute abdomen that are not typically seen in Kawasaki
    disease.[9, 12-14] However, current understanding of the full spectrum of manifestations of
    SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is very limited because most existing reports are derived from
    cross-sectional assessments of children with more severe illnesses, such as hospitalized
    children.[3, 15, 16] Less is known regarding the the symptoms and illness duration among
    ambulatory children in the community with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our objective was to report
    the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of all children and adolescents ≤18 years of
    age diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of and up to 30 days after diagnosis in a
    large, integrated health network affiliated with an urban academic medical center in the southern
    United States (U.S.). We also evaluated trends in infection rates during implementation and
    subsequent relaxation of community mitigation measures.
                                                                                                                                        4

    Methods
    Study design and population
    Active laboratory surveillance was performed for all symptomatic and asymptomatic adults and
    children ≤18 years of age with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
    in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) laboratory, a quaternary care academic
    hospital located in Nashville, Tennessee. The primary pediatric facility in the VUMC network
    includes a 343-bed acute care pediatric hospital with more than 16,000 inpatient discharges,
    47,000 emergency department (ED) encounters, and 360,000 ambulatory clinic encounters
    each year. SARS-CoV-2 testing was offered in the inpatient, ED, and ambulatory settings, which
    includes 9 VUMC urgent care clinics that see patients >2 years, 6 VUMC pediatric-only urgent
    care clinics, 2 dedicated on-campus SARS-CoV-2 testing sites, and 14 urgent care clinics
    located within private retail pharmacies. This network serves a sociodemographically and
    ethnically diverse patient population derived from across urban, suburban, and rural Tennessee,
    southern Kentucky, and northern Alabama. The study was reviewed and approved by the
    VUMC Institutional Review Board.
    SARS-CoV-2 testing
    Nucleic acid amplification testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed with a variety of
    methodologies with Emergency Use Authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration
    (with multiple platform-use dictated by supply limitations). These platforms included (with the
    percent of positive results among the total positive cohort): a modified Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention (CDC) qRT-PCR assay (58.3%), the Roche 6800 (13.6%), the Hologic
    Panther (13.0%), the GenMark Eplex (6.3%), the Diasorin Liaison (3.9%), the Biofire FilmArray
    SARS-CoV-2 monoplex (3.5%), the Cepheid GeneXpert (1.2%), and the Abbott IDNOW (<1%).
                                                                                                                                        5

    The CDC assay employed the N1 and N2 primer/probe sets for SARS-CoV-2 with
    amplification/detection on an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 Flex. Specimens were
    nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs in viral transport media, with the exception of the IDNOW, for
    which dry swabs were used. Testing on the IDNOW platform was limited to asymptomatic
    pateints only, while the other platforms included both symptomatic and asymptomatic
    individuals.
    Indications and locations for testing
    SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing became available in our institution on March 12, 2020. At that time,
    given limited testing capacity, testing criteria in children were restricted to symptomatic
    individuals (new onset respiratory symptoms and fever or known contact with a SARS-CoV-2
    infected individual); these indications were communicated electronically to ordering providers by
    hospital leadership. Routine screening of all pregnant women admitted to the Labor and
    Delivery unit began on April 22, 2020. Routine screening of asymptomatic individuals prior to
    other hospital admissions, initiation of chemotherapy, stem cell or solid organ transplant, or
    certain surgical or medical procedures was initiated on May 4, 2020. While indications for
    testing expanded over time to include asymptomatic individuals admitted to hospital or
    undergoing outpatient procedures, testing guidance was standardized across testing sites. Daily
    numbers of tests performed and number of positive tests among symptomatic and
    asymptomatic subjects were collected from April 26, 2020 through July 17, 2020 for this
    assessment.
    Study follow-up
    For symptomatic patients and neonates born in our hospital to SARS-CoV-2-positive women
    detected upon routine hospital admission, our team performed phone follow-up at days 2, 7, and
    30 after the laboratory diagnosis to obtain baseline sociodemographic characteristics and
                                                                                                                                        6

    ascertain data on exposures, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, and illness status. We also
    reviewed medical records, when available, to collect clinical and demographic information. For
    asymptomatic patients with a positive screening test, our team performed phone follow-up at 30
    days after the positive test result.
    Statistical analysis
    Descriptive analyses were conducted using STATA/SE 14.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station,
    TX). Daily and 7-day moving average percent positivity frequencies were calculated and
    stratified by asymptomatic and symptomatic status. While the majority of the analyses were
    done in the pediatric age group, test positivity rates were compared between children and adults
    during the same study period.
    Results
    From March 12 to July 17, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 tests were positive in 5261/70071 (7.5%)
    specimens obtained at VUMC testing sites and hospitals across all age groups, including
    531/10327 (5.1%) specimens in patients ≤18 years, compared to 4730/59744 (7.9%) specimens
    in patients >18 years.
    Asymptomatic children and adolescents
    Forty-six/5752 (0.8%) specimens from asymptomatic children and adolescents screened after
    close contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infected individual or prior to hospitalization or medical
    procedures were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among 5752 specimens tested in asymptomatic
    patients ≤18 years, 3766 (65.5%) specimens were tested prior to medical procedures, 1265
    (22.0%) prior to hospital admission, 190 (3.3%) prior to chemotherapy, 98 for known exposure
                                                                                                                                        7

    to SARS-CoV-2 infected individual, 18 (0.3%) prior to stem cell or solid organ transplant, and
    415 (7.2%) for other/unknown reasons. One patient screened prior to hospital admission
    developed respiratory symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and entered our ‘symptomatic’ follow-
    up cohort. Among 33 unique patients with initial asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 detection during
    the follow-up window, none of the 10 patients with 30-day follow-up available developed
    symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 within 30 days.
    Neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers
    All 15 neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers during the study period had negative
    PCR tests at birth and 24 hours later. One infant subsequently acquired symptomatic SARS-
    CoV-2 infection at 5 weeks of age, shortly after his father developed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2
    infection, and entered our ‘symptomatic’ follow-up cohort. The remaining 14 neonates remained
    well without SARS-CoV-2 symptoms by the time of the 30-day follow-up phone call.
    Symptomatic children and adolescents
              A total of 485/4575 (10.6%) specimens from 459 unique symptomatic children and
    adolescents were positive during the study period (Table 1). From these 459 children, 326
    (67%) positive tests were collected in outpatient settings, 131 (29%) in the ED, and 2 (0.4%)
    during hospital admission. The median duration from time of symptom onset to time of SARS-
    CoV-2 testing was 2 days (IQR 1-3 days).
              The median age of symptomatic patients was 12.6 years (IQR 4.9-17.1; Table 1); 60
    (13%) were <1 year of age, 56 (12%) 1-4 years, 65 (14%) 5-9 years, 95 (21%) 10-14 years, and
    183 (40%) 15-18 years. The majority of patients were male (53%) and white (77%); over one-
    third of patients were of Hispanic ethnicity or Middle Eastern ancestry. 67% had a known close
    contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Almost one-quarter (21%) of patients had at least one
    comorbidity.
                                                                                                                                        8

              The most common symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were cough (51%),
    fever >100.4°F (42%), headache (41%), and rhinorrhea (34%; Figure 1A). ‘Other’ symptoms
    were reported at the following frequencies: nasal congestion (15%), watery or red eyes (3%),
    decreased oral intake, fussiness, ear pain or fullness (2%), sneezing, loss of taste, wheezing,
    chest pain or tightness (1%), and hypothermia, constipation, altered mental status, syncope,
    dizziness, possible seizure activity, and dusky discoloration of toes (<1%).
               We classified symptoms as respiratory (cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, shortness of
    breath), gastrointestinal (GI; nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), or general (headache,
    myalgia, anosmia, fatigue, chills, rash; Figure 1A). In Figure 1B, the proportion of patients who
    exhibited respiratory, GI, and/or general symptoms, with or without fever are displayed. The
    majority of patients (331/459; 72%) exhibited at least one respiratory symptom, most commonly
    (214/331 [65%]) without GI symptom(s) present. Only 35/459 (8%) patients presented with GI
    symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. General symptoms, without respiratory or GI
    symptoms, occurred in 10% of patients. Fourteen (3%) patients presented with fever without
    respiratory, GI, or general symptoms.
              Twenty-one of 459 (4.6%) patients were hospitalized shortly after diagnosis of SARS-
    CoV-2 infection; 3 patients’ hospitalizations were considered unrelated to SARS-CoV-2
    (scheduled chemotherapy, minor trauma, suicidal ideation) and 18 (3.9%) patients’
    hospitalizations were considered possibly related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among these 18
    patients, 13/18 (72%) were white, 5/18 (28%) were black, and 7/18 (39%) were of Hispanic
    ethnicity. One patient required admission twice, resulting in 19 possibly SARS-CoV-2-related
    hospitalizations. Median length of stay among these 19 hospitalizations was 1.5 days (range 1
    to 12 days); 11/19 admissions lasted 48 hours or less. Details of these 19 hospitalizations are
    listed in Table 2. No patient required intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, or
    extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the study period. One patient with multiple
    comorbidities, not included among the 18 patients hospitalized, died upon presentation to the
                                                                                                                                        9

    emergency department; it is unclear if the cause of death was related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
    We observed 1 case of MIS-C during the study period.
              Complete symptom resolution occurred by day 2 in 192/447 (43%) and by day 7 after
    diagnosis in 335/429 (78%) patients who could be reached for follow-up. Among 94 patients
    with ongoing symptoms at day 7, the median age was 14.4 years (IQR 6.4-17.4), and the most
    commonly reported ongoing symptoms were cough (34 patients), ‘other’ symptoms (33
    patients), anosmia (23 patients), fatigue (18 patients), and headache (12 patients). At day 7,
    177/429 (41%) patients reported experiencing excessive worry or anxiety pertaining to their
    COVID-19 diagnosis. Symptom resolution occurred by follow-up day 30 in 373/396 (94%)
    patients who could be reached for follow-up. Among 23 patients with ongoing symptoms at day
    30, the median age was 12.8 years (IQR 3.7-17.4), and the most commonly reported ongoing
    symptoms were cough, fever, fatigue (4 patients), anosmia (3 patients), chest pain, headache,
    abdominal pain, ageusia, and nasal congestion (2 patients). Thirty-nine reported ongoing
    anxiety related to their COVID-19 diagnosis at day 30. No child was diagnosed with recurrent
    SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period.
    Prevalence and percent positivity in pediatric and adult samples
              Overall, from April 26 to July 17, 2020, a median of 536 specimens (interquartile range
    [IQR] 415-742) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 per day at our institution across all ages, which
    increased over the study period. The number of positive tests per day and the 7-day average
    percent positivity for symptomatic and asymptomatic children and adults are shown in Figure 2.
    After early variability, corresponding with periods of community mitigation measures, the
    number of positive tests and percent positivity began to rise in mid-June for both children and
    adults, corresponding to liberalization of community mitigation restrictions. Case numbers and
    percent positivity remained high at the end of the observation period.
                                                                                                                                      10

    Discussion
              In this cohort of children tested for SARS-CoV-2 at a single academic institution in the
    southeastern U.S. from March 12-July 17, 2020, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection was
    substantially higher among symptomatic (10.6%) than asymptomatic (0.8%) children.
    Symptomatic children and adolescents in our cohort most commonly exhibited febrile respiratory
    syndromes without GI symptoms, which were generally brief and mild, with only a small minority
    of 459 symptomatic patients (4%) requiring hospital admission, and no patients requiring
    intensive care or mechanical ventilation during the study period. Despite high levels of
    community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in our region, the overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
    infections in our cohort was slightly lower in children than adults.
              These findings are consistent with prior reports that children with SARS-CoV-2 infection
    often exhibit mild clinical presentations, and generally experience less severe clinical outcomes
    than adults.[1, 3, 6, 7, 16] In one of the earliest published cohorts of pediatric COVID-19 cases
    from the U.S., consisting of cases voluntarily reported to the Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention, an estimated range of 5.7-20% of pediatric COVID-19 cases required
    hospitalization, while 29% of adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection required hospitalization in a
    separate report from an integrated health care system in California.[1] In an assessment of all
    hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a hospital system in New York, <1% of
    hospitalizations occurred in children, and none died, compared to deaths occurring in 21% of
    hospitalized adults.[16] Recently, an overall rate of 8 hospitalizations per 100,000 children <18
    years of age was reported in a population-based surveillance system comprised of data from 14
    states, with approximately one-third of hospitalized children requiring ICU admission, with
    substantially higher hospitalization rates among Hispanic and black children than among white
    children.[17] Similarly, we observed that Hispanic children comprised roughly one-third of
    symptomatic patients and nearly 40% of hospitalized patients in our cohort. In another recent
    report from a large, integrated pediatric healthcare network in Pennsylvania, despite a relatively
                                                                                                                                      11

    low frequency of critical illness, a higher proportion of patients required hospitalization for
    SARS-CoV-2-related illness (approximately 12%), respiratory support (5.7%), and mechanical
    ventilation (2.8%) than in our cohort. The reasons that severe illness was less common in our
    cohort compared to these prior studies are unclear, as baseline clinical and demographic
    characteristics of the patients were similar between the studies.
              The clinical features of illness observed in our cohort were similar to other pediatric
    studies from the U.S., which reported that fever, cough, or shortness of breath occurred in
    73%[3] and 75%[7] of pediatric patients, compared to 81% in our study. Another recent study of
    adults and children found that 96% of 164 symptomatic COVID-19 patients experienced fever,
    cough, or shortness of breath, and 45% exhibited all three symptoms.[18] However, this study
    included only 9 pediatric subjects (<18 years). We also found a slightly higher frequency of
    general symptoms such as headache (41%), fatigue (26%), and anosmia (20%) than in prior
    pediatric reports.[3, 7] Our study is unique in that we followed duration of illness and observed
    that the majority of children had symptom resolution within 1 week of diagnosis.
              Our finding that SARS-CoV-2 was less frequently identified in children than adults has
    been consistently demonstrated in other studies from the U.S. and other countries.[4-6, 19] In
    an early report from the U.S., pediatric cases comprised <2% of all voluntarily reported COVID-
    19 cases prior to early April 2020.[3] Whether this represents a truly lower prevalence of
    infection in children, or differential testing patterns between children and adults, potentially
    related to milder disease phenotypes in children, is not well-established, although studies have
    suggested that risk of developing clinical symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection increases
    with age.[20] The implications of these findings on public health measures to mitigate
    transmission are still being unraveled. For other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, children
    are considered key drivers of transmission. However, early data suggest that children may not
    be the primary drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within households and communities.[21]
    Thus, the impact of primary interventions to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission aimed at
                                                                                                                                      12

    children might have a relatively minor impact, particularly if SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility is low
    in the setting of only mild or subclinical infection.
              In our community, a “Safer at Home” order went into effect on March 23, 2020, directing
    all residents of the county to stay home unless engaged in certain essential activities, with
    restrictions in place pertaining to operation and capacity of certain local businesses, including
    retail shops, non-essential service establishments, bars, and restaurants. A phased reopening
    process was initiated on May 11, 2020, involving clear guidelines for liberalizing restrictions,
    with built-in metrics for reversion to earlier phases as necessary. The city proceeded from
    Phase 1 to Phase 2 on May 25, to Phase 3 on June 22, and reverted to modified Phase 2 on
    July 3, 2020.[22] The increases in symptomatic cases in late June in both children and adults
    suggests that liberalization of these community mitigation measures may have had some impact
    on infection patterns.
              Our study has a number of important strengths. By identifying all children with SARS-
    CoV-2 detections in the context of an integrated health network as the outbreak emerged, our
    study enabled a comprehensive assessment of the full spectrum of pediatric infection in the
    community, from asymptomatic infection to more severe illness. By prospectively following
    these subjects, we were able to assess not only the symptoms present at diagnosis, but also to
    follow the duration of symptoms, and to follow asymptomatic subjects for the development of
    symptoms after the initial detection.
              Our study is also subject to some limitations. Our cohort is limited to patients who visited
    one of our network’s testing sites for assessment. Due to limited testing capacity, especially
    earlier in the study period, testing was recommended only for individuals with new-onset
    respiratory symptoms, fever, or a known SARS-CoV-2-positive contact; thus, providers were
    discouraged from sending SARS-CoV-2 testing on patients with other symptoms, such as
    gastrointestinal or general symptoms alone, which introduced sampling bias. Real-time
                                                                                                                                      13

    monitoring of testing indications was impractical and testing practices may have varied by
    provider.
              In summary, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among individuals ≤18 years were
    generally associated with respiratory symptoms, mild illness that usually resolved within a week,
    and rarely required hospitalization. Cases increased in our community in both children and
    adults as local businesses reopened, highlighting the importance of community mitigation
    strategies in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
