   Abstract
   Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a key player for innate immunity activation. It is therefore a prime target for
   sepsis treatment, as antibiotics are not sufficient to improve outcome during septic shock. Extracorporeal
   removal method by polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) is used in Japan, but recent trials failed to
   show a significant lowering of circulating LPS levels after PMX-DHP therapy. PMX-DHP has a direct
   effect on LPS molecules. However, LPS is not present in a free form in the circulation, as it is mainly carried
   by lipoproteins, including low density lipoproteins (LDL). Lipoproteins are critical for physiological LPS
   clearance, as LPS are carried by low density lipoproteins (LDL) to the liver for elimination. We
   hypothesized that LDL-apheresis can be an alternate method for LPS removal. We demonstrated first in
   vitro that LDL apheresis microbeads are almost as efficient as PMX beads to reduce LPS concentration in
   LPS-spiked human plasma, whereas it is not active in phosphate-buffered saline. We found that PMX was
   also adsorbing lipoproteins, although less specifically. Then, we found that endogenous LPS of patients
   treated by LDL-apheresis for familial hypercholesterolemia is also removed during their LDL-apheresis
   sessions, both with electrostatic-based devices and filtration devices. Finally, LPS circulating in the plasma
   of septic shock and severe sepsis patients with gram-negative bacteremia was also removed in vitro by LDL
   adsorption. Overall, these results underline the importance of lipoproteins for LPS clearance, making them
   a prime target to study and treat endotoxemia-related conditions.

   Introduction
   Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB), is the
   most widely studied and one of the most potent pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (1). LPS
   is a potent trigger of the innate immune response during GNB sepsis, although its role was also demonstrated
   in non-GNB sepsis and non-septic conditions (1, 2), probably because of endogenous sources of LPS
   magnified by shock, such as bacterial translocation from the gut. LPS has been considered as a therapeutic
   target for sepsis ever since it was recognized (3). Monoclonal anti-LPS antibodies failed in most clinical
   studies, partly because of poor specificity (4). Thereafter, encouraging results were obtained with
   extracorporeal removal by polymyxin (PMX) B hemoperfusion, developed in Japan (5). Unfortunately,
   further clinical trials did not confirm the efficacy of this treatment to improve clinical outcomes (6).
   Interestingly, the results of a recent, well-conducted clinical trial showed that circulating LPS levels were
   not significantly decreased after PMX hemoperfusion (7). In fact, even though the affinity of PMX for the
   lipid A moiety of LPS is strong in water, it is dramatically decreased when LPS is spiked in a protein
   solution, and even more in plasma (8).
   Lipoproteins are well-known to play a major protective role during sepsis and inflammation (9). Due to its
   amphipathic properties, LPS is rapidly and massively (more than 75%) bound by plasma lipoproteins (10),
   partly explaining the low extraction capacity of polymyxin in plasma. In the same way, lipoproteins can
   also carry other important lipidic PAMPs such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a component of gram-positive
   bacteria cell wall (11). Lipoproteins enhance the clearance of LPS from plasma during sepsis (12): they
   bind, inactivate (13) and transport LPS molecules to the liver for biliary elimination (14). In rodents, sepsis
   is classically accompanied by a global cytokine-mediated increase of lipoproteins (15), whereas in humans,
   LDL and HDL cholesterol are decreased (16). Lipoprotein levels at the onset of sepsis affect the outcome
   of patients: a low HDL (high-density lipoprotein) level was recently found to be the best prognostic marker
   for adverse outcomes in a sepsis cohort (17). This corroborates earlier findings by our group showing that
   low cholesterol levels (both HDL and LDL) is a risk factor of sepsis and poor clinical outcome in patients
                                                                                                                                         4

   undergoing cardiac surgery (18, 19). Indeed, LPS is first bound to HDL particles in the circulation, but its
   elimination requires first a transfer to LDL (low density lipoproteins) mediated by proteins such as LPS
   binding protein (LBP) or PLTP (phospholipid transfer protein)-mediated (14), and secondly internalization
   and degradation by hepatocytes via LDL receptor (LDLR-r) (20). We have termed this pathway reverse LPS
   transport (21) by analogy with cholesterol, and it may bear a critical role during human sepsis. We showed
   that PLTP-deficient mice had higher sepsis-induced mortality (22) and that recombinant PLTP could restore
   the biliary excretion capacity and improve survival of the animals (12). The role of LDL-r is showed in
   human sepsis where patients presenting loss-of-function mutations of the inhibitory protein PCSK9
   (Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9) show increased survival (23) and increased LPS clearance (20),
   although PCSK9 inhibition in mice failed to reduce LPS-induced mortality (24). PCSK9-induced LDL-r
   decrease (and therefore decreased hepatic LDL uptake) is a feature shared by patients presenting sepsis-
   induced organ failure (25) and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) (26). Patients with severe homozygous
   FH are successfully treated with extracorporeal LDL apheresis with columns using electrostatic adsorption
   of LDL’s apolipoprotein B (27). In the present study, we hypothesized that LDL adsorption can be used to
   remove LPS from plasma.

   Methods
   Healthy volunteers and critically ill patients
   We used plasma samples from a biologic collection of a critically ill patients’ cohort from our medical
   Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Dijon University hospital (IVOIRE study) (28). Patients (or their next of kin)
   were informed and signed an additional, specific consent form authorizing the conservation and utilization
   of biological samples. Plasma samples were collected on the day of inclusion (< 24 hours since ICU
   admission. The samples were processed following a strict protocol, 1 hour maximum after sampling, with
   protocolized centrifugation and immediate freezing at -80°C, then transferred for storage at the biobank
   facility of Dijon University Hospital (Centre de Ressources Biologiques Ferdinand Cabanne). Healthy
   ambulatory volunteers (n=49) were also recruited in this study to serve as controls. Each volunteer provided
   informed consent. Exclusion criteria for volunteers were: recent surgery (<30 days) or dental care (< 72
   hours), any current or recent (<30 days) infectious episode with antibiotic therapy, current or recent (<30
   days) immunosuppressant therapy including corticosteroids.
   Study approval
   The institutional review board (Comité de Protection des Personnes Est I, Dijon) approved the protocol for
   the collection of LDL apheresis patients’ samples, and considered it to constitute routine clinical practice as
   no additional samples were drawn. The need for informed consent was waived, but all patients or their
   relatives were given clear information about the study, and their non-opposition was obtained. Collection
   of nominative data was approved by the national authority for the protection of privacy and personal data.
   Plasma samples from septic patients and healthy control subjects originate from a clinical study which
   received approval from the local Ethics Committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Est I) under the
   number 2013/15 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01907581). All patients and/or their next of kin were
   informed and consent was documented in the patients’ medical records by the investigator.

   LDL apheresis samples
   Patients were recruited in a national reference center for LDL apheresis in Paris, France. Patients received
   information of the study goals and gave consent. No additional blood samples were drawn, as the remaining
   volume of plasma from the routine sample was used for the presented analyses. No further clinical data
   (other than epidemiologic) were collected.
   In vitro microbeads experiments
   Individual plasma samples were spiked at a concentration of 500 ng/mL of O55:B5 E. coli LPS
   (Thermofisher Scientific, USA), and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C without agitation. Sampling for
   measurement of LPS, lipid profile and proteins at time 0 (T0) was made after incubation. Each plasma was
   then added to three different types of microbeads prepared in separated 2ml Eppendorf tubes. Microbeads
   used were: polymyxin B crosslinked 6% agarose (Separopore® 6B-CL) beads (Endotoxin AffisorbentTM,
   bioWorld, USA), DALI® system polyacrylate microspheres (Fresenius, Germany), and Separopore® 6B-
   CL (bioWorld, USA) as control. Microbeads were washed the same day with sterile saline (500ml for 10
   grams) and stored at +4°C. In each Eppendorf tube, 400µl of plasma was added to 200mg of microbeads
   (1200µL of plasma per individual sample), following the plasma/substrate ratio used in clinical LDL-
   apheresis sessions 2. Eppendorf tubes were then incubated at 37°C for 2 hours with rotative agitation (25
   RPM). Supernatant plasma was sampled after settling of the beads.
   Isolation of lipoprotein-deficient plasma fraction
   Lipoprotein deficient plasma was used as an additional control matrix. Ten individual human plasma
   samples were used. Plasma density was adjusted to 1,21g/ml using solid KBr. Lipoprotein deficient plasmas
   were obtained by ultracentrifugation for 3 hours at 4°C, 100,000 rpm using a TLA-120.2 fixed-angle rotor
   in an optima TLX ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter). Infranatant was collected and dialyzed overnight
   against PBS buffer at 4°C.

   LPS analyses
   LPS was quantified using a mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) patented method (EndoQuant) for detection
   of 3HM. For this purpose, two aliquots of plasma (50µl) are spiked with 4 pmol of internal standard (3-
   hydroxytridecanoic acid). For total 3HM quantitation, samples were hydrolysed with HCl 8 M for 3 h at
   90°C. Free fatty acids were then extracted with hexane/ethyl acetate 3/2 mix, and resuspended in ethanol
   after vacuum evaporation. Fatty acid separation was performed in an Infinity 1290 HPLC binary system
   (Agilent) equipped with a ZORBAX SB-C18 C18 50 x 2.1 mm 1.8 µm column (Agilent) set at 30°C.
   MS/MS detection was performed using a QQQ 6490 triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Agilent) equipped
   with a Jet-Stream ESI source. Quantitation of 3HM was performed by negative SRM mode as previously
   described (29). The limulus amoebocytes lysate (LAL) assay was also used in parallel (LAL chromogenic
   endpoint assay, Hycult Biotech).
   Other analyses
   Plasma total proteins, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were analysed
   using an INDIKO® analyser (ThermoScientific, France).
   Statistical analysis
   Data analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism 7. Normally distributed data were analyzed using
   paired, 2-tailed Student’s t test. Quantitative variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). All
   analyses were performed using with a significance threshold set at 0.05.
                                                                                                                                         8

   Results
   LPS adsorption by LDL-apheresis microbeads in LPS-spiked healthy volunteers’ plasma
   To determine if LDL apheresis columns can remove LPS from plasma, we first used plasma samples from
   49 healthy volunteers, spiked and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C with 500ng/ml of O55:B5 E. coli LPS. Each
   individual LPS-spiked plasma was then incubated for 2 hours with agitation at 37°C after adding one of 3
   different substrates: polymyxin B crosslinked 6% agarose (Separopore® 6B-CL) beads (Endotoxin
   AffisorbentTM, bioWorld, USA), DALI® system (clinical LDL-apheresis column) polyacrylate
   microspheres (Fresenius, Germany), and Separopore® 6B-CL (bioWorld, USA) used as control. Control
   beads were used to normalize for the sample dilution induced by the hydrated substrates (sterile saline was
   used for priming of all substrates). For this reason, control substrate rather than baseline was used for
   reference in comparisons. Measurements of LPS were made using 2 different techniques. LAL remains the
   standard method for measuring endotoxin activity. However, LAL relevance in plasma is questioned (30),
   as there is interference with inhibitors, mainly lipoproteins as detailed earlier. We developed a mass
   spectrometry method retaining LAL’s sensitivity in plasma for LPS quantitation, using a specific compound,
   3-hydroxy myristate (3HM). When LPS is spiked in plasma, 3HM concentration remains stable, whereas
   LAL reactivity is decreasing rapidly over time (29). Thus, 3HM concentration is probably a better indicator
   of the total amount of LPS in plasma (i.e. including lipoprotein-bound LPS), whereas LAL requires the lipid
   A moiety of LPS to be exposed. Endotoxin activity and 3HM levels both decreased significantly after
   incubation with DALI® beads compared to control beads, as well as after incubation with PMX (44.6% and
   33.5% of control endotoxin activity, respectively, Figure 1A; and 72.8 ±11% and 61 ±13% of control 3HM
   levels, respectively, Figure 1C). A basic sensitivity analysis was performed: samples with high baseline
   levels of 3HM (above mean +SD) were removed (to eliminate a spurious effect caused by artificially high
   levels of LPS in the sample). The results remained unchanged with a similar, significant decrease of 3HM
   with DALI® and PMX beads compared to control (73.2 ±11% and 59.8 ±13%, respectively). The
   experiment was repeated in LPS-spiked phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and showed no effect of
                                                                                                                                         9

   incubation with DALI beads, whereas incubation with PMX decreased LPS levels (significantly for 3HM,
   Figure 1B, non-significantly for endotoxin activity, Figure 1D). Additionally, DALI and PMX were also
   incubated with LPS-spiked lipoprotein-deficient plasma from 10 control plasma samples (Figure 2). After
   incubation with PMX, 3HM levels decrease was enhanced in lipoprotein-deficient plasma, as compared to
   whole plasma (58% reduction versus 40%, respectively). Conversely, efficiency of DALI microbeads was
   considerably reduced in lipoprotein-deficient plasma (11% reduction versus 27% in whole plasma),
   although 3HM decrease remained significant in this matrix (Figure 2).
   The baseline lipid profile of plasma samples was within normal range: total cholesterol 2.05 ±0.6 g/l,
   triglycerides 1,24 ±0.6 g/l, HDL cholesterol 0.65 ±0.2 g/l, LDL cholesterol 1.18 ±0.5 g/l. The results
   obtained for LPS adsorption were not statistically significantly different between subjects with high and low
   levels (above and under the average) of total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol.
   We also analyzed the relation between the percentage of LPS reduction observed with DALI beads and
   corresponding plasma LDL cholesterol levels, and found no statistically significant correlation (r=0.062,
   p=0.68). The same absence of correlation was found with triglyceride, HDL and total cholesterol levels.
   Adsorption of lipoproteins by both DALI and PMX
   As expected, incubation with DALI beads led to profound alterations in lipid profile (Figure 3). LDL
   cholesterol (LDLc) levels were decreasing the most at only 5.1% of control, and HDL levels were not
   decreasing. As already known from clinical practice of LDL-apheresis (31), triglycerides levels were also
   markedly reduced with DALI (48.1% of control). More surprisingly, the lipid profile was also altered after
   incubation with PMX (Figure 3). Compared to DALI, LDLc and triglycerides reduction were more modest
   (55.3% and 72.7% of control, respectively), but there was also a reduction of HDL (68.5% of control). The
   dilution factor (based on protein levels variation from baseline) was around 0.75 for all 3 substrates (0.73,
   0.77 and 0.75 for PMX, DALI and control, respectively).

   Efficacy of clinical LDL-apheresis to remove endogenous LPS from the circulation in patients with
   familial hypercholesterolemia
   To determine if the effect observed in LPS-spiked human plasma could be reproduced in a clinical setting
   with endogenous endotoxemia, we analyzed samples from patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)
   undergoing LDL-apheresis sessions. Blood samples were drawn before and after each session. As expected,
   LDLc was effectively reduced by apheresis techniques down to 26 ±9 % of baseline (Figure 4A). We
   analyzed samples from 77 LDL-apheresis sessions performed on 41 individual patients. Overall, LPS levels
   decreased between the sample drawn before and after the LDL-apheresis session, as assessed by 3HM (150.6
   ±97 vs 89.7 ±70 pmol/ml, p<0.0001, Figure 4B) or LAL (0.25 ±0.15 vs 0.18 ±0.11 EU/ml, p=0.0002, Figure
   4C). We compared the LPS level reduction observed with the different apheresis techniques. Most patients
   were treated with the Liposorber® system (Kaneka, Japan), using a column filled with microbeads coated
   with dextran sulfate providing negative charges to attract the apolipoprotein B present at the LDL surface
   (32). When looking only at the 53 (69%) Liposorber® sessions, 3HM reduction was still significant (150
   ±89 vs 100.5 ±81 pmol/ml, p<0.001, Figure 4D). The second more frequently used apheresis system was
   the DALI® system (Fresenius, Germany). This system is based on the same basic principle of electrostatic
   adsorption, but uses polyacrylate instead of dextran sulfate (27). In the 19 (25%) DALI® sessions we
   analyzed, 3HM levels were also reduced (156.8 ±127 vs 68.4 ±37 pmol/ml, p<0.001 Figure 4E). The
   remaining 5 sessions (6.5%) used double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP). DFPP takes advantage of the
   large size of lipoproteins to separate them from other plasma constituents, combining a plasma filter
   (2 000kDa molecular weight cutoff membrane separating plasma from blood cells) with a second membrane
   with lower cutoff (1 000kDa) (33). This method is used in patients in whom other systems are not well
   tolerated or insufficient. In DFPP sessions, 3HM levels were also decreased (131.25 vs 63.4 ±12 pmol/ml,
   p=0.009, Figure 4F). Even though few DFPP sessions were analyzed, this result is suggesting that LPS
                                                                                                                                       11

   reduction induced by LDL apheresis is due to the removal of lipoproteins themselves and not to a direct
   fixation of LPS by beads, e.g. by electrostatic interactions, although this can’t be ruled out by our results.
   Removal of endogenous LPS in patients presenting severe gram-negative bacteria infections
   After demonstrating that LDL adsorption is efficiently removing spiked LPS from healthy human plasma,
   and that endogenous LPS from FH patients is also removed by LDL apheresis sessions, we sought to
   determine if endogenous, “pathogen-related” LPS can also be removed from the circulation. To that end,
   we used plasma from a cohort of critically ill patients recruited in our center. Plasma samples drawn at their
   admission to the intensive care unit were available for 507 patients, 60 of them with positive blood cultures,
   of whom 24 were positive for GNB. Finally, plasma samples (500µl aliquots stored at -80°C) from 22
   patients were used (2 consent forms missing). Nineteen of them (86%) presented with septic shock criteria,
   the 3 other patients had severe sepsis according to sepsis-2 definitions applying at the time of study (34).
   The average lipid profile of plasma samples was close to normal but with high variations between patients:
   total cholesterol 2.51 ±1.3 g/l, triglycerides 1,76 ±0.9 g/l, HDL cholesterol 0.58 ±0.4 g/l, LDL cholesterol
   1.20 ±1.2 g/l. Each of these samples was then incubated as described before for 2 hours at 37°C with DALI®
   microbeads (200mg of beads for 400µl of plasma), without additional LPS spiking. The small volume of
   available plasma per patient prevented the use of the agarose control substrate. To make up for the absence
   of control, the 3HM levels after incubation were corrected for each patient using measured protein dilution
   factor, averaging 0.83 ±0.16. Of note, the protein dilution factor was not significantly different when
   compared head-to-head with control substrate in previous in vitro experiments (Figure 3). The following
   correction formula was applied to each incubated sample: [corrected 3HM] = [measured 3HM] / [individual
   dilution factor]. Corrected 3HM levels were significantly decreased by 24% (p<.0001, Figure 5) after
   incubation with DALI® microbeads. This is suggesting that LDL apheresis can also remove LPS circulating
   during GNB-induced septic shock and sepsis.

   Like in healthy volunteers, LPS adsorption was similar between subjects with high and low levels (above
   and under the average) of total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol. We did not
   find either any statistically significant correlation between LDL, HDL, triglyceride and total cholesterol
   levels and the percentage of LPS reduction.

   Discussion
   We demonstrated for the first time that LDL apheresis is a viable alternative to PMX adsorption for the
   removal of LPS from plasma. Extracorporeal LPS removal during sepsis is still in the focus of research with
   many recent and ongoing trials, despite disappointing results obtained with PMX hemoperfusion. LPS levels
   reduction with PMX hemoperfusion was low or even absent when it was measured in clinical trials (7). Our
   results show that LDL adsorption is almost as efficient as PMX to reduce LPS concentration in plasma
   spiked with a high concentration of LPS. Conversely, LPS adsorption is impaired in lipoprotein-deficient
   plasma, and absent in PBS. This is indicating that the LPS reduction with LDL apheresis microbeads is
   indeed mediated by LDL adsorption rather than by direct binding of LPS by the beads. However, although
   the efficiency of DALI microbeads was considerably reduced in lipoprotein-deficient plasma, 3HM was
   still significantly reduced. This may suggest that DALI beads can also bind “free” LPS, or LPS bound to
   proteins (such as LBP or PLTP). Moreover, we found that LPS reduction by DALI microbeads was not
   correlated to LDL levels, which may suggest that the quantity of lipoproteins is not the primary determinant
   of LDL apheresis efficiency to remove LPS from plasma. Thus, other qualitative aspects such as lipid and
   protein composition (35), as well as potential LPS “preload” of lipoproteins should be considered (10).
   Another question is raised by the discrepancy that we observed in vitro between the drastic reduction of
   LDL levels (96% ±0.3) and the relatively modest reduction of LPS levels with DALI (27% ±11%), although
   in vivo (in FH patients) reduction levels of LDL and LPS were closer (85% vs 40%, respectively). Thus,
   the LPS that is not removed with LDL may be free in plasma but also bound to other lipoproteins such as
   HDL, as suggested by recent data (36).
   We found that PMX could also non-specifically adsorb lipoproteins, an underrecognized fact that could
   account for a part of its efficacy in plasma. To our knowledge, the effect of PMX adsorption on global
   lipoprotein levels reduction is described here for the first time. However, this effect was suggested by a
   study demonstrating a binding of PMX with radiomarked LDL (37). In this study, hydrophobic interaction
   between PMX and LDL particles could explain the observed reduction. PMX is indeed an amphiphilic
                                                                                                                                       14

   molecule, with a polar (cationic) as well as a non-polar moiety. Hydrophobic bonds are also critical in the
   interaction between LPS and PMX (38). The hydrophobic adsorption of lipoproteins by PMX would have
   2 consequences: first, it would be a new, underrecognized mode of action of PMX for reducing LPS burden
   (by adsorbing both the lipoprotein and the LPS molecules bound to the lipoprotein); secondly, it might
   competitively inhibit PMX’s direct binding of LPS in its other forms: bound to monocytes, comprised in
   intact bacteria or cell wall debris, micelles (1)… Then, it could also paradoxically compromise the efficacy
   of “free” LPS clearance from the circulation by competitive inhibition, and partly explain the poor results
   obtained with PMX hemoperfusion for septic shock (6, 7).
   The efficacy of LDL apheresis to remove LPS was confirmed in a cohort of patients undergoing therapeutic
   LDL apheresis for FH. Endotoxemia is commonly associated with atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia
   (39), and LPS removal could contribute to the reduction in atherosclerosis observed in these patients (40).
   Lastly, LDL adsorption reduced LPS levels in plasma from septic patients with GNB bacteremia. However,
   as we did not directly test LDL apheresis in septic patients, our study does not allow to conclude that the
   LPS reduction obtained with LDL apheresis would improve clinical outcome or if adverse effects would
   prevail. Furthermore, it is hard to say whether LDL apheresis would even reduce in vivo inflammation
   accordingly, i.e. the removed LPS may already be out of reach of the TLR4 pathway. One should also
   consider the possibility that lowering plasma lipoproteins could lead to a decrease in LPS binding capacity
   (inhibiting “reverse LPS transport”), and subsequently increase free LPS concentration and macrophage
   activation. Strategies that remove free LPS may be more effective than removing LPS bound to lipoproteins,
   which may already be neutralized. Nevertheless, the equilibrium between free and lipoprotein-bound LPS
   is complex, and both could be reduced by LDL-apheresis. Another possible limitation for LDL apheresis is
   the fact that large amounts of LPS can also be bound to VLDL during sepsis (41, 42), which could mitigate
   the effect of LDL-apheresis in this context. Also, we did not find a greater effect of DALI compared to
   PMX, as predicted by our initial hypothesis. We cannot exclude that in a clinical setting (hemoperfusion
   with limited contact time with the substrate, etc.), the difference would be more pronounced in favor of one
   or the other. However, it is difficult to conclude, based on our results, that LDL-apheresis during sepsis
                                                                                                                                       15

   would fare better than PMX hemoperfusion. Removal of LDL particles may still have an advantage over
   conventional PMX hemoperfusion, as lipoproteins carry many other lipidic pathogen associated molecules
   such as lipoteichoic acid (11).
   The comparative efficacy of LDL-apheresis should be tested first in animal models of septic shock.
   However, extracorporeal circulation therapy is technically very difficult to apply to murine models.
   Overall, these results still confirm the major role of the reverse LPS transport by circulating lipoproteins,
   making them a prime target to study and treat endotoxemia-related conditions.

    not PBS.
    LPS levels are decreasing after incubation with both DALI® and polymyxin (PMX) microbeads in LPS-
    spiked human plasma from 49 healthy volunteers, as assessed by 3HM levels (A), and LAL (limulus
    amoebocyte assay) (C). In spiked PBS (n=3), only incubation with PMX is reducing 3HM levels (B). LAL
    decrease with PMX did not reach significance in PBS (D). Data represent mean ± SD. *** p<.001 and ns:
    p>0.05 by two-tailed paired t-test.

    Figure 2: LPS levels before and after incubation of LPS-spiked, lipoprotein-deficient plasma with
    LDL apheresis microbeads and polymyxin microbeads
    LPS levels are decreasing after incubation with polymyxin (PMX) microbeads in LPS-spiked, lipoprotein-
    deficient human plasma from 10 control plasma samples, as assessed by 3HM levels. LPS decrease induced
    by incubation with LDL apheresis microbeads (DALI) is also significant, although weak (11% versus 58%
    reduction with PMX). Data represent mean ± SD. *** p<.001 and ns: p>0.05 by two-tailed paired t-test.

    Figure 3: PMX beads are reducing LDL but also HDL cholesterol levels, whereas LDL apheresis
    beads are mostly efficient in reducing LDL and triglycerides.
    Data represent mean percentage reduction from baseline ± SEM. All paired comparisons for difference (3
    per parameter) were statistically significant (two-tailed paired t-test p<.05), except for control and DALI®

    Figure 5: LPS reduction by LDL apheresis in the plasma of septic patients with GNB bacteremia.
    3HM levels are decreased in the plasma of 22 septic patients with GNB bacteremia, even after correction of
    the 3HM levels after incubation with protein dilution (A). Before-after comparison shows a significant
    24.1% reduction (B). *** p<.001 with two-tailed paired t-test.
