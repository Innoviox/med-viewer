       Abstract
       This report uses the SIQR model proposed by Takashi Odagaki to examine the epidemic
       trend of COVID-19 in nine major countries during February-May 2020, and to clarify the
       peculiar trend of infection in Japan. The SIQR model, which is an improvement on the
       conventional SIR model, is unique in that it allows us to theoretically clarify the epidemic
       phenomenon by separating the number of daily confirmed new cases by testing and the
       number of infecteds at large who remain untested, and also allows us to theoretically
       consider measures to control the epidemic. The infection control measures of each country
       were analyzed by dividing them into three groups according to the size of the decay (or
       growth) rate of infected at large (λ). The active group includes China and South Korea, the
       passive group includes the United States and Sweden, and the average group includes
       Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and Japan. China and South Korea are the countries with the
       best testing and quarantine systems, and South Korea in particular having managed to
       contain the infection without lockdown through early quarantine by thorough testing. On
       the other hand, the United States and Sweden do not have a well-developed inspection and
       quarantine system and have shown little restraint in social distancing. In the case of Japan,
       the following special factors may have contributed to the extreme lack of PCR testing : (1)
       The "4-day fever rule" established by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare was
       strictly enforced. (2) Even after the decision to postpone the Olympics, the government
       continued to monopolize PCR testing for the sake of unified analysis of infection data, and
       the policy of expanding PCR testing by private companies was not implemented.
       1. Introduction
          Using the SIQR model proposed by Takashi Odagaki1), this report examines the epidemic
       trend of COVID-19 from February to May 2020 in nine major countries, and identifies
       specific trends in the actual state of infection in Japan.

           When the Diamond Princess returned to the port of Yokohama on February 3, the total
      number of infected people on board was 712. While I was keeping a close eye on the situation
      after the ship began disembarking on February 19, I noticed that the trend in the number of
      infected people in Japan during March and April differed from the rest of the world.
           Figure 1 compares the cumulative number of people infected after reaching 100 by country,
      and it can be seen that Japan's trend is quite pequliar.
        Why are Japan's trends up to the date of the decision to postpone the Olympics (3/24)
      different from those of Germany and France? Why is this different from Sweden, which also
      adopted the herd immunity policy? And why is the number of cases of infection increasing
      rapidly after the date of the decision to postpone? Through theoretical analysis of these
      questions using the SIQR model, we summarize below how the situation was progressing.

       2. Methods of Analysis
          First, we summarize the method of the SIQR model based on the paper by Takashi Odagaki.
       The SIQR model, which is a modification of the conventional SIR model, is unique in that it
       provides a theoretical understanding of epidemic phenomena by separating quarantined
       infected people identified by testing and community-acquired people who remain untested,
       and also provides a theoretical consideration of measures to control the epidemic.
       2.1 Setting the Basic Formula
        The statistical data reported daily is the "number of new infections", which can be treated as
       the "number of positive cases per day" and can be expressed as ΔQ(t) = qI(t) in the SIQR
       model.
        That is, I(t) = ΔQ(t)/q = ΔQ(t)/(βN-γ-λ). where I(t) is the number of infecteds at
       large, (q) is the quarantine rate, βN is the transmission coefficient, and γ is the removal rate
       and λ are determinants of the decay (or growth) rate of infected at large, which can be
       expressed as (βN-q-γ).
        The next step is to determine the effectiveness of social distancing (a) and the enhancement
       factor of quarantine rate (b), which is a factor of human-induced infection control measures,
       as well as the rate of increase or decrease in the number of new define λ = (1-q'-a)βN-qb-
       γ as the λ that takes into account the quarantine rate of the new patients immediately after
       they are infected (q') of infection-positive individuals to be.
        Since no one is isolated immediately after infection due to a long incubation period, the
       quarantine rate of the new patients immediately after they are infected (q') shall be regarded
       as zero in principle.
       2.2 Verification Procedure
       The "number of positive cases per day" ΔQ(t) is approximated by an exponential function
       ΔQ(to)eλ(t-to) with a coefficient of λ, as in the case of the number of infecteds large I(t).
       Based on the distribution of the number of positive cases per day, we also classify them into
       an initial phase, an expansion phase, a transition phase, and a decay phase, and establish a
       continuous period classification, from the first to the fourth period. The coefficient λ and the
       initial value ΔQ(to) are determined by obtaining an exponential approximation curve for
       each period based on the actual values. In the case of China and Korea, the period of spread
       of infection is earlier than the first period and is considered to be the expansion phase. Next,
       γ, βN, q, a, and b are set as follows.
       1) Since the removal rate γ of community-infected persons is considered to be almost
       constant during the entire period, the number of days of cure is estimated to be 33 days, and
       the inverse of 0.03 is set.
       2) The quarantine rate q for the 2nd period (expansion phase) is considered to be very low,
                                                                   3

       and so set q = 0.
       3) The transmission coefficient βN in the 2nd period (expansion phase) are set based on the
       coefficient λ determined by an exponential approximation curve using data from the 2nd
       period(βN=λ+q+γ). This βN is used in the 1st ,3rd and 4th period.
       4) The quarantine rate q in the 3rd period (transition phase) is determined by an exponential
       approximation curve based on the 3rd period data. It is set up from the coefficient λ (as close
       to 0 as possible), βN and γ. (q = βN-γ-λ). The same q is used in the 1st and 4th period.
       5) The effectiveness of social distancing (a) and the enhancement factor of quarantine rate
       (b) in the 4th (decay) period should be set so that λ = (1-q'-a) βN-qb-γ based on the factor
       λ determined by the exponential approximation curve based on the 4th period data and the
       previously set βN, q, and γ. The λ re-set after setting (a) and (b) is defined as the amount
       for determining the decay (or growth) rate of infected at large. The default value of the
       effectiveness of social distancing (a) is 0, and the default value of the enhancement factor of
       quarantine rate (b) is 1.0. In the 1st (initial) period, (b) is treated as variable, and in the 4th
       (decay) period, (a)and (b) are treated as variable.
       3. Analysis of Country Data
          Based on the above analysis, we will analyze the actual number of infected people in Japan
       and Tokyo, as well as the actual number of infected people in other countries, to clarify the
       situation in each country and the parameters of the SIQR model.
       3.1 Countries and data used for verification
          In addition to Japan and Tokyo, the countries selected as COVID-19 verification cases
       using the SIQR model are those with distinctive infection control measures, in the order of
       the earliest date of the cumulative number of infected people reaching 100. The eight
       countries are China (1/18), South Korea (2/20), Italy (2/23), France (2/29), Germany (3/1),
       Spain (3/2), the United States (3/3), and Sweden (3/6). The figures in parentheses indicate
       the month and date when the cumulative number of cases reached 100, and that in Japan is
       2/10.
          For the graph of theoretical estimates of the number of infecteds at large and confirmed
       new cases, it is assumed that the confirmed new cases occurred two weeks after the community
       infection at large and that the confirmed new cases occurred one week later in South Korea
       due to the early response.
          The data for Japan used in the theoretical analysis are from the Toyo Keizai ONLINE data2),
       which were published by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. For the purpose of
       analysis, data from the Diamond Princess were excluded. Data for Tokyo are from the Tokyo
       Metropolitan Government3) and data for other countries are from Johns Hopkins University4).
                                                                   4

       Data on population and number of tests conducted are from Worldometers's COVID-19 5).
       3.2 Verification using Japan and Tokyo data
        Due to the peculiarity of Japan’s trend up to the date of the decision to postpone the
       Olympics (3/24), the 1st period is set for 2/18 to 3/23. The 2nd expansion period is set for
       3/24 to 4/10, the 3rd transition period is set for 4/11 to 4/18, and the 4th decay period is set
       for 4/19 to 5/19. The theoretical analysis and parameter verification values based on actual
       daily positive case data are summarized in Table 1, together with those of foreign countries.
       (1) The enhancement factor of quarantine rate (b)
        In the 1st period in Japan (the inspection suppression phase), the enhancement factor of
       quarantine rate (b) is calculated to be 0.57 due to the λ obtained by the exponential
       approximation curve and the βN, q and γ determined in from the 2nd period to the 4th
       period, since the effectiveness of social distancing (a) can be regarded as zero. In other words,
       until the date of the decision to postpone the Olympic Games in Japan (3/24), Japan had
       taken about 60% of the measures to prevent the isolation of people from the second and
       subsequent phases by suppressing testing.
       (2) The effectiveness of social distancing (a)
        In the 4th decay period in Japan, the effectiveness of social distancing (a) is calculated to be
       0.53 due to the λ obtained by the exponential approximation curve and the βN, q, and γ
       determined in the 2nd and 3rd period, since the enhancement factor of quarantine rate (b)
       can be regarded as 1.0. This means that the behavioral restraint rate during the decay phase
       in Japan is estimated to have been about 50%.
          Using the same method, the effectiveness of social distancing (a) during the decay phase
       based on Tokyo data is 0.70, and it is estimated that about 70% of people in Tokyo refrained
       from contacting each other.
       (3) Transmission coefficient βN and Quarantine rate of infecteds at large (q)
        The transmission coefficient βN in Japan is 0.152, and the quarantine rate of infecteds at
       large (q) is 0.13. The results are quite small in comparison to that of other countries
       mentioned below.
       (4) Fraction of infecteds at large in the population
        The effective decay (or growth) rate of infected at large in Japan is 8.52, and for every 16,000
       positive cases, there are approximately 140,000 infecteds at large, with the fraction of
       infecteds at large in the population of 0.109%.
          According to the results of the verification of Tokyo data using the same method, the
       effective decay (or growth) rate of infected at large was 9.86. It is estimated that there are
       approximately 50,000 infecteds at large compared to 5,000 positive cases, with the fraction of
       infecteds at large in the population of 0.365%.
                                                                   5

                     Figures 2 and 3 show the graphs of confirmed new cases and exponential approximation
      curves for Japan and Tokyo. In addition, assuming that confirmed new cases occur 2 weeks
      after community infection, the graphs of the estimation of the number of infecteds at large
      and confirmed new cases in Japan and Tokyo are shown in Figures 4 and 5.

                     Figure 4 shows that the peak of infection in the city is around April 1, the middle of the
      transition period, and the state of emergency is declared six days later in April. It shows that
      it was issued on the 7th. Also, the date of the decision to postpone the Olympics (3/24) would
      have been in the middle of a citywide outbreak.

      3/6. The transmission coefficient was 0.332, the highest among the nine countries, and the
      quarantine rate of community-infected persons was 0.345, which is the highest among the
      nine countries. The effective decay (or growth) rate of infected at large was 2.19, with
      approximately 180,000 infecteds at large compared to 83,000 positive cases. The fraction of
      infecteds at large in the population is estimated to be 0.013% (see Figures 6, 7 and Table 1).

      (2) Verification using South Korea data
        In Korea, the 1st expansion period is set for 2/20-2/29, the 2nd transition period is set for
      3/1-3/4, the 3rd decay period(phase1) is set for 3/5-3/18, and the 4th decay period(phase2)
      is set for 3/19-5/19. The transmission coefficient was 0.266 and the quarantine rate of
      community-infected persons was 0.22, which were both nearly twice as high as those in Japan.
      In Korea, the spread of infection was rapid and the rate of decay was fast. The enhancement
      factor of quarantine rate (b) in the 3rd period was 1.78, contributing to the decrease in the
      transmission coefficient after measures βN. It can be said that the policy of early detection
      and isolation through thorough testing is effective. The effective decay (or growth) rate of
      infected at large was 3.32, and for the 11,000 positive cases, there were approximately 37,000
      infecteds at large. The fraction of infecteds at large in the population is estimated to be
      0.072%.

      (3) Verification using Italy data
        In Italy, the period classification is set as follows: the 2nd expansion period is set for 3/1-
      3/27, the 3rd transition period is set for 3/28-4/2, and the 4th decay period is set for 4/3-
      5/19. The transmission coefficient was 0.195, and the quarantine rate of community-infected
      persons was 0.165, which is about 30-40% higher than that of Japan. On the other hand, the
      effectiveness of social distancing in the 4th period was 0.21, which was smaller than in Japan.
      It appears that the behavioral restraint was not as thorough as in Japan. The effective decay
      (or growth) rate of infected at large was 6.03, with approximately 1.37 million infecteds at
      large compared to 230,000 positive cases. The fraction of infecteds at large in the population
      is estimated to be 2.26% (see Figure 10,11 and Table 1).

      (4) Verification using France data
                  In France, the period classification is set as follows: the 2nd expansion period is set for 3/1-
      3/31 ,the 3rd transition period is set for 3/31-4/11, and the 4th decay period is set for 4/12-
      5/19. The transmission coefficient was 0.209, and the quarantine rate of community-infected
      persons was 0.204, which was 40%-50% lower than that of Japan. On the other hand, the
      effectiveness of social distancing in the 4th period was 0.28, which was smaller than in Japan.
      It appears that the behavioral restraint was not as thorough as in Japan. The effective decay
      (or growth) rate of infected at large was 3.08, and for every 180,000 positive cases, there are

      (5) Verification using Germany data
                  The period classification in Germany is set as follows: the 2nd expansion period is set for
      2/23-3/20, the 3rd transition period is set for 3/21-3/28, and the 4th decay period is set for
      3/29-5/19. The transmission coefficient was 0.238, and the quarantine rate of community-
      infected persons was 0.21, which was about 60%-70% higher than that of Japan. On the other
      hand, the effectiveness of social distancing in the 4th period was 0.21, which was smaller than
      in Japan. It appears that the behavioral restraint was not as thorough as in Japan. The effective
      decay (or growth) rate of infected at large was 4.58, with approximately 810,000 infecteds at
      large compared to 180,000 positive cases. The fraction of infecteds at large in the population
      is estimated to be 0.97% (see Figures 14,15 and Table 1).

      (6) Verification using Spain data
        In Spain, the period classification is set as follows: the 2nd expansion period of is set for 3/2
      to 3/25, the 3rd transition period of is set for 3/26 to 4/1, and the 4th decay period of is set
      for 4/2 to 5/19. The transmission coefficient was 0.279, and the quarantine rate of
      community-infected persons was 0.249, which was 80%-100% higher than that of Japan. On
      the other hand, the effectiveness of social distancing in the 4th period was 0.25, which was
      smaller than in Japan. It appears indicating that the behavioral restraint was not as thorough
      as in Japan. The effective decay (or growth) rate of infected at large was 3.66, with
      approximately 850,000 infecteds at large compared to 230,000 positive cases. The fraction of
      infecteds at large in the population is estimated to be 1.82% (see Figures 16,17 and Table 1).

      (7) Verification using USA data
                        In the U.S., the period classification is set as follows: the 1st initial period is set for 3/3 to
      3/18, the 2nd expansion period is set for 3/19 to 4/4, the 3rd transition period is set for 4/4
      to 4/23, and the 4th decay period is set for 4/24 to 5/19. After the 2nd period, the
      transmission coefficient was 0.148 and the quarantine rate of community-infected persons
      was 0.100, the same level as in Japan. The effective decay (or growth) rate of infected at large
      was 9.59, with approximately 14.65 million infecteds at large compared to 1.53 million
      positive cases. The fraction of infecteds at large in the population is estimated to be 4.43%
      (see Figures 18,19 and Table 1).

      (8) Verification using Sweden data
                        In Sweden, the period classification is set as follows: the 2nd expansion period is set for 3/6-
      4/10, the 3rd transition period is set for 4/11-4/23, and the 4th decay period is set for 4/24-
      5/19. The transmission coefficient was 0.113, and the quarantine rate of community-infected
      persons was 0.0673, which was 20%-40% lower than that of Japan. The behavioral restraint
      rate in the 4th decay period was 0.24, which is smaller than in Japan. It appears indicating
      that the behavioral restraint was not thorough. The effective decay (or growth) rate of infected
      at large was 14.1, with approximately 430,000 infecteds at large compared to 31,000 positive
      cases. The fraction of infecteds at large in the population is estimated to be 4.32% (see
      Figures 20,21 and Table 1).
                                        Sweden tends to have a very low rate of the quarantine rate of infecteds at large and a very
      high rate of the fraction of infecteds at large. This may reflect the herd immunity policy .

      ４．Comparison of measures in each country
        We divide infection control measures into the active group (λ ≤ 0.1), the average group (-
      0.1<λ<-0.02), and the passive group (-0.02≤λ<-0) according to the magnitude of the decay
      (or growth) rate of infected at large (λ) in each country and compare them. The right
      direction of Figure 22 represents the level of testing/quarantine systems, and the downward
      direction represents the magnitude of the effectiveness of social distancing (+ early
      quarantine effect).

                           Figure 22, which shows the comparison of measures in each country, reveals the following.
        1) China and South Korea are the countries with the best testing/ quarantine systems.
        2) South Korea is the country with the highest degree of effectiveness of social distancing (+
      early quarantine effect), and the transmission coefficient after measures has decreased due to
      early quarantine through thorough testing.
                                                                                                                                                   13

                        3)The United States and Sweden are the only countries with a poor testing/quarantine
              system and a low effectiveness of social distancing. Sweden, which has a herd immunity policy,
              has the lowest rates for both parameters.
                        From the above, it can be said that the measures taken by South Korea, which did not have
              a lockdown system and adopted a policy of early detection and quarantine of positive cases
              through PCR testing, were effective.
              ５. Discussion
                                  The following is a summary of the characteristics of the new corona infection trend in Japan.
              (1) Number of tests performed and Number of positive cases
                        The number of tests conducted in Japan is extremely low, at 214 per 100,000 people,
              compared to 1/7 in South Korea, 1/10 in France and Sweden, 1/20 in Germany and the US,
              1/26 in Italy and 1/35 in Spain. The number of positive cases per 100,000 people is 13, which
              is very low in relation to the number of tests performed. As shown in Figure 23, which shows
              the relationship between the number of tests performed and the number of positive cases, the
              number of positive cases in Japan is extremely low compared to other countries.
              (2) Quarantine rates of infecteds at large and Transmission coefficients
                        The quarantine rate of of infecteds at large in Japan is 0.130. The coefficient is 20% to 60%
              lower than that of other countries (0.165-0.345) except for the U. S. (0.100) and Sweden
              (0.0673). The transmission coefficient is 0.152. It is 20% to 50% lower than that of other
              countries (0.195 to 0.332) except for the U.S. (0.148) and Sweden (0.113). Figure 24 shows
              the trends for the quarantine rate of infecteds at large and the transmission coefficient in each
              country, and you can see that there is a very high correlation between the two factors.

      (3) Quarantine rate and Effective decay (or growth) rate of infected at large
                Figure 25 shows the relationship between the quarantine rate and the effective decay (or
      growth) rate of infected at large and the smaller the quarantine rate, the more the effective
      decay (or growth) rate of infected at large tends to be large. In the case of Japan, the effective
      decay (or growth) rate of infected at large was 8.52, following Sweden's 14.1 and the U.S.'s
      9.59.
      (4) Number of positive cases and Fraction of infecteds at large in the population
                Figure 26 shows the relationship between the number of positive cases per 100,000 and the
      fraction of infecteds at large in the population, and you can see that when the number of
      positive cases is low, the fraction of infecteds at large tends to be small. In Japan, the fraction
      of infecteds at large is 0.109%, which ranks third after China and South Korea. On the other
      hand, in Sweden and the U. S., where the number of positive cases per 100,000 people is high,
      the fraction of infecteds at large is 4.3% to 4.4%, and in Spain and Italy the rate is 1.8% to
      2.3%.

      (5) Fraction of infecteds at large in the population and Actual antibody possession rate
                The results of large-scale surveys of antibody possession rates in various countries are
      awaited in order to evaluate the estimates of the fraction of infecteds at large in the population
      based on the SIQR model. However, based on the results of surveys in Japan, the United
      States, Sweden, and other countries, the SIQR model has the potential to reproduce the
      current situation (see Table 2). In particular, the fraction of infecteds at large in the
      population of 0.365% in Tokyo is close to the Softbank Group's antibody possession rate of
      0.43%.

      (6) Effectiveness of social distancing and Movement reduction rate
        The effectiveness of social distancing during the 4th period was estimated to be 53% in Japan
      as a whole and 70% in Tokyo. This is higher than in the Google Mobile Location Survey6),
      which uses mobile device location data. In other words, the report's data show that during the
      4th period (4/19-5/19), the average decline in "retail and entertainment," "transfer station"
      and "workplace" was 39% for Japan as a whole and 54% for Tokyo. In the case of Sweden, the
      average movement reduction rate in the same report happened to match the 24%
      effectiveness of social distancing in the 4th decay period, but in all other countries, the
      effectiveness of social distancing tended to be smaller than the mobile survey's movement
      reduction rate (see Figure 27).

        In the case of Japan, the level of self-restraint among its citizens is considerably higher than
      in the United States and Europe, but the movement reduction rate does not necessarily reflect
      the effectiveness of social distancing. In locked-down countries such as Italy, France, and
      Spain, the movement reduction rate is as high as 60-70%, while the effectiveness of social
                                                                                                             16

      distancing is as low as 20-30%. One possible reason for this is the high fatality rate in these
      countries. The relationship between the fatality rate and the difference between the
      movement reduction rate and the effectiveness of social distancing shows a fairly high
      correlation (Figure 28). In other words, countries with higher fatality rates tend to have less
      of a lockdown effect and lower effectiveness of social distancing.

                              rate and the effectiveness of social distancing
         It is important to note that the reasons for the low effectiveness of social distancing in
      locked-down countries are (1) the toxicity and highly infectious variants of the new
      coronaviruses increase the lethality rate, so that reduced movement alone may not reduce
      contact infection, and (2) differences in lifestyle habits, such as resistance to wearing masks,
      hugging, handshaking, and loud conversations, may not reduce contact infection through
      reduced movement alone.
      (7) The peculiarity of Japan
        The number of tests conducted in Japan was extremely low, but this alone cannot explain the
      peculiar curve in the number of cases shown in Figure 1. Other possible reasons for Japan's
      peculiarity are as follows.
      1) The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's "How to Prevent a New Coronavirus"
      (Feb.17) announced that a "four-day fever rule" was established in which patients must have
      a fever of 37.5°C or higher for four days or more to be consulted. As a result of the strict
      implementation of the rule, the percentage of PCR tests performed in the whole country to
      the number of consultations with the Returnee and Contact Center was 2.9% by 11 March
      and 4.0% by 31 March.
      2) Until the date of the decision to postpone the Olympics (March 24), it was expected that
      information on the number of infected people unfavorable to the hosting of the Olympic
      Games would be as low as possible, but verification of the SIQR model showed that the
                                                                                                                 17

       enhancement factor of quarantine rate was 0.57 during the first period of test suppression up
       to the date of the decision to postpone the Olympics, and that tests were suppressed by about
       40% compared to the second and subsequent periods. This is the reason why the Japanese
       curve in Figure 1 is peculiar for the period from February 17 to March 24.
       3) After the date of the decision to postpone, there is no longer a brake on the release of
       information on the number of infected people, but the Ministry of Health, Labour and
       Welfare and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other governmental
       organizations monopolized the data for unified analysis of infection data. As a result, no
       measures were taken to expand PCR testing by the private sector and the "four-day fever
       rule" continued further.
       4) Verification of the SIQR model showed that as a result of test suppression, the quarantine
       rate of infecteds at large in Japan was 0.13, which was 20% to 60% smaller than in other
       countries (0.165 to 0.345) except for the United States (0.100) and Sweden (0.0673).
