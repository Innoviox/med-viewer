    Abstract:
    There are evidences that show increased antimicrobial consumption among COVID-19 patients.
    This has increased the burden on worsening situation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
    throughout the world. Bangladesh, one of the countries with highest numbers of COVID-19
    cases, without effective regulation of antimicrobial prescription may suffer in future with study
    results showing a significant proportion of participants taking antimicrobial without proper
    indication and prescription from physicians. Suggested mitigation strategies include – strict
    regulation of over the counter (OTC) antimicrobial prescription, testing biochemical marker such
    as procalcitonin prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy, introduction of color coded and
    tightly sealed bottled antimicrobial drugs, massive campaigning on social media, effective
    utilization of telemedicine and finally, raising awareness among physicians and patients
    regarding judicial use of antimicrobial.

    Introduction:
    COVID-19, an ongoing pandemic, has already created immense burden on health and social care
    system worldwide1, 2. One of the major issues encountered by physicians and researchers are lack
    of effective and safe treatment options against COVID-19. Hence, a plethora of anti-microbial
    agents and biological medicines have already been used either on a trial basis or as a last gasp
    measure to save patient lives. But, increased prescribing of antimicrobial, without first validating
    their effectiveness in treating COVID-19 cases, might flare up antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
    among patients3. On the other hand, increased societal awareness towards threats from infectious
    diseases, rational prescribing of antimicrobial drugs and good sanitary practices during this
    pandemic may subsequently have beneficial effect on AMR4. This short report will discuss
    issues of AMR during this era of COVID-19 including, but not limited to, how the ongoing
    pandemic might complicate the ongoing fight against AMR, evidences of indiscriminate
    antimicrobial usage among Bangladeshi COVID-19 patients, and how developing countries like
    Bangladesh should react to fight off this looming threat of AMR.
    COVID-19 and AMR: Fighting on two fronts
    Around 700000 people die each year due to antibiotic resistance. If urgent measures are not
    taken, by the year 2050 around 10 million people would lose their lives to resistant microbes
    culminating in a financial loss similar to that of 2008-09 global financial crisis5. This projection
    is applicable for all countries irrespective of financial prowess, but the burden would be felt
    heavier by low-middle and low income countries including densely populated countries in South
    Asia and parts of Africa5.
                                                                       2

    The main challenge to manage patients of COVID-19 is its wide and unpredictable range of
    clinical manifestations. Around 84% people suffering from COVID-19 have mild or
    uncomplicated symptoms6. On the other hand, 14% may develop severe illness and need to be
    hospitalized, and among them 5% require ICU management6. However, only 1 to 10% of
    patients have been reported to contact secondary bacterial infections7. Despite the low rate of
    secondary bacterial infections, 45% of COVID-19 patients are receiving antibiotic therapy
    irrespective of their disease severity8.
    The widespread usage of multi-drugs among hospitalized and critically ill patients may also
    increase AMR burden3. Literature evidences regarding bacterial and fungal co-infection among
    hospitalized patients are currently lacking, but nevertheless, a significant proportion of them
    receive multidrug and broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, rendering them vulnerable against
    selection of multidrug resistant (MDR) organisms9.
    Azithromycin (in the macrolide and ketolide class), as well as vancomycin, carbapenems,
    tigecycline, ceftriaxone and linezolid, which are all classified as critically important
    antimicrobials (CIA) by WHO are being widely prescribed during this pandemic10. WHO also
    reports that, though combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine is not recommended
    outside clinical trials, combination drugs are being used randomly at different hospitals around
    the world11. Moreover, sudden collapse of patients triggering stress and anxiety, with unavailable
    expert opinion on antibiotic usage may lead towards inappropriate or overuse of antibiotics12.
    Furthermore, a very common misconception among the public is that antibiotics can be used for
    viral infections (i.e., the common cold)13, and in developing countries like Bangladesh and India,
    where buying antibiotics from pharmacy is a common practice14, COVID-19 may further
    complicate the ongoing fight against AMR.
                                                                       3

    To prevent high infection rate, antimicrobial soaps and disinfectant cleaners are used widely as
    the most effective measure against COVID-19 infection, which can also have negative impact on
    AMR as they contain biocides that are antimicrobials15 This exposure of biocidal agents may
    increase the risk of cross resistance to antibiotics16, particularly those that treat Gram-negative
    bacteria17.
    Here, the use of antimicrobials among COVID-19 patients gives rise to a dilemma, as without
    any recognized therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19 or current unavailability of a safe vaccine,
    physicians around the world are being forced to choose a wide range of antimicrobials in a
    desperate attempt to halt the progression of disease or exacerbation of a secondary condition in
    an individual. So, there are ultimately two different challenges to combat here – one is to treat
    COVID-19 patients, and another challenge is not to increase the burden of AMR by prescribing
    broad spectrum and unnecessary antimicrobial drugs.
    Irrational prescribing and overuse of anti-microbial during COVID-19: Evidences from
    Bangladesh
    There is a well-established national guideline for clinical management of COVID-19 patients in
    Bangladesh. Without any sign of significant secondary bacterial infection, irrational antibiotic
    prescribing is prohibited within the national guideline18. Despite repeated attempts to avert
    potential complicated situation like AMR, preliminary reports from national newspaper and
    hospital records suggest COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms are usually found to be taking
    self-prescribed antimicrobials such as macrolides (azithromycin), doxycycline, anti-malarial drug
    (hydroxychloroquine), anti-parasitic (Ivermectin), and even trial drugs such as Favipiravir and
    Remdesivir without consulting physicians and completely disregarding their potential harmful
    side-effects19.
                                                                       4

    In order to further evaluate the extent of irrational antimicrobial usage, 100 covid-19 PCR
    positive patients, selected randomly from a tertiary COVID-19 PCR testing center in Dhaka,
    were contacted over phone and details regarding their sign-symptoms, drug history and
    consultation with physician/hospital admission history were sought. Among those participants,
    96 of them gave accounts of symptoms classified as “mild disease” under the national guideline
    for COVID-19 clinical management, with most study participants (n=81) citing mild to moderate
    fever as one of their presenting complaints before opting for SARS-COV-2 PCR. Other notable
    symptoms included cough/sneezing/runny nose/ sore throat (n=32), headache (n=19), muscle
    ache (n=15), anosmia (n=8), chest pain/respiratory distress (n=4), diarrhea (n=3), and finally in a
    number of cases there were no symptoms (n=18).
    Participants were asked questions regarding their health service seeking behavior (consultation
    with a physician) and their drug history. Surprisingly, only 55 participants consulted with a
    physician after being diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, while remaining 45 participants did not
    consult any physician/ healthcare worker after being diagnosed.
    Detailed drug history were sought from participants with mild COVID-19 symptoms. A
    significant number of them (n=61) had one or more anti-microbial in their treatment regimen.
    Azithromycin was the most frequently prescribed drug (n=46) followed by ivermectin (n=22),
    doxycycline (n=21), and fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin (n=6), moxifloxacin (n=4), and
    anti-viral drug such as favipiravir (n=4). Interestingly, only 25 of them had single anti-microbial
    agent in their treatment regimen with remaining 36 participants taking two or more anti-
    microbial simultaneously after being diagnosed as COVID-19 positive.
                                                                       5

    Mitigation Strategies to counteract potential increase in AMR
    The intervention and mitigation strategies should include strict implementation of clinical
    treatment guidelines of COVID-19 to limit unnecessary antimicrobial usage, appropriate
    measures to intensify routine surveillance of AMR and restriction of over-the counter (OTC)
    sales of antimicrobial by law enforcement20. Ensuring appropriate antimicrobial in hour of need
    while avoiding unnecessary or prolonged antimicrobial course should be the principle of
    antimicrobial prescribing21.
    Obtaining adequate microbiological evidence of pathogen before prescribing antimicrobial is of
    paramount importance to overcome this challenge. Unfortunately, this can be time consuming
    since there is a lack of advanced laboratory facilities within the country, and hence often puts the
    physician in a dilemma, especially when patient is critically ill and requires urgent intervention.
    As a result, without proper dosing and indications nearly half of all antimicrobial are being
    prescribed, which may contribute to the development of resistant pathogens22.
    In order to overcome this issue, procalcitonin, an important serum biochemical marker can serve
    as a helpful adjunct to clinical judgment to distinguish between bacterial and viral infection
    especially in Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRTI) and for guiding antibiotic therapy as it
    remains undetectable in healthy individual23. Bacterial endotoxins as well as inflammatory
    cytokines such as TNF, IL-1B, and IL-6 act as a trigger for increased production of
    procalcitonin24, 25.
    Little is known about correlation between SARS-CoV-2 and serum level of procalcitonin.
    However, rise of serum procalcitonin level in COVID-19 patients was observed in patients who
    required hospitalization or ICU admission explaining plausible bacterial co-infection or release
                                                                       7

    of cytokine due to severe inflammatory response26, 27. In this regard procalcitonin might act as a
    guiding tool to initiate antibiotic in COVID-19 infected patients or patients presented with
    symptoms of LRTI during this pandemic.
    There should be a clamping down on irrational prescription of anti-microbial without proper
    advices from clinicians. One possible solution in Bangladeshi context could be introduction of
    color coded strips of anti-microbial so that people purchasing them from pharmacy might know
    the potential harms associated with consumption these drugs without proper indication28.
    Another reason behind anti-microbial resistance is not taking drugs for suggested duration
    treatment. People usually purchase anti-microbial from pharmacy and as soon as symptoms are
    alleviated, they stop taking anti-microbial without completing the course. This might be solved
    with introduction of tightly sealed bottle containing anti-microbial drugs sufficient for a 3, 7, 14
    or 21 day course.
    Social media platforms may play influential role in educating and raising awareness among
    antimicrobial prescribers, patients, and the general public on the significance of antibiotics in
    viral infections. Visual aids such as posters, brochures, and advertisements could be used in the
    local media as worthwhile intervention strategies. Awareness campaign displaying local
    surveillance data and sharing real life experience of individuals who have suffered from COVID-
    19 or any superbug in the past may help create a positive impact within the communities29.
    Motivating physicians to start communicating with patients about the judicial use of
    antimicrobial and negative effect of AMR on health and economy might significantly improve
    the chances of success of such campaign30. Besides these, telemedicine could play potential role
    in this regard. This innovative technology allows physicians to provide critical support to
                                                                       8

    AMR31.
    Conclusion:
    The report illustrated the central importance of rational prescribing of anti-microbial during
    COVID-19 pandemic. It is evident that, Bangladesh, with a fragile health infrastructure, is
    currently struggling to curb down on overuse of antimicrobial among COVID-19 patients with a
    significant percentage of them, mostly with mild disease, taking one or more anti-microbial
    without consultation from physician or health care worker. More and extensive researches are
    recommended in near future to understand the true nature of antimicrobial overuse among
    Bangladeshi COVID-19 patients.
