         ABSTRACT
         Purpose: (1) To assess the morphology and 3D displacements of the eye globe and
         optic nerve (ON) in adduction/abduction using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (2)
         To assess differences between healthy emmetropic and highly myopic (HM) subjects.
         Methods: MRI volumes of both eyes from 18 controls and 20 HM subjects in primary
         gaze, abduction and adduction (15°) were postprocessed. All ONs were manually-
         segmented and fitted to a 3D curve to assess ON tortuosity. ON displacements were
         evaluated in 4 quasicoronal planes which were perpendicular to the ON in primary
         gaze and 3 mm apart.
         Results: Axial length was higher in the HM group (28.62±2.60 vs 22.84±0.89 mm;
         p<0.0001). Adjusted ON tortuosities (i.e., ON tortuosities estimated before myopia
         onset) were lower in HM eyes (0.9063±0.0591) versus controls (1.0152±0.02981) in
         primary gaze, adduction (0.9023±0.05538 versus 1.0137±0.0299) and abduction
         (0.9100±0.0594 versus 1.0182±0.0316); p<0.0001 for all cases. In all eyes, ON
         displacements in adduction were significantly different from those in abduction in the
         naso-temporal direction (p<0.0001 in all planes) but not in the supero-inferior
         direction. ON displacements in the posterior segments of the ON were smaller in the
         HM group in both gaze directions and were larger in the anterior-most ON segment
         in adduction only.
         Conclusions: The adjusted tortuosity of the ON was significantly lower in HM eyes,
         suggesting that eyes destined toward HM exhibited higher ON traction forces during
         eye movements before the onset of myopia. Our ON metrics may be valuable to
         explore a potential link between eye movements and axial elongation.

         INTRODUCTION
                   Myopia is the most common refractive error in young population and is
         characterized by an axial elongation of the eye over time. Currently, there is a high
         prevalence of myopia and high myopia (HM) worldwide, especially in East and
         Southeast Asia.1,2 HM is highly correlated with pathological myopia, which could lead
         to complications such as myopic macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization
         and retinal detachment.3
                   Myopia has a multifactorial aetiology. Both genetic and environmental factors
         may contribute to myopia onset and progression.4 The recent global rise of myopia
         prevalence indicates that environmental factors could be critical in the development
         of myopia. The major environmental risk factor for myopia is education pressure,
         which includes long duration of near work and limited time outdoors during daylight
         hours.5,6 A number of studies have shown that the link between near work and
         myopia is consistent.7–9 Although the association between myopia and near work
         has long been established, its mechanism is still unclear.
                   During near work, accommodation and convergence (combined with other
         types of eye movements such as downward gaze) of the eye occur simultaneously.
         Studies have shown that accommodation could induce a small transient increase in
         axial length.10–13 However, after removing the effect of accommodation, a few
         studies have found that eye movement alone during near work (such as
         convergence and/or downward gaze) could result in significant axial elongation.14–16
         These studies have speculated that forces generated by the extraocular muscles
         during eye movements may be the cause of axial elongation in convergence.

         However, the directions of extraocular muscle forces are not along the axial direction,
         especially in light of the muscle pulley theory,17 thus it is unlikely that these forces
         would cause scleral remodelling to yield posterior expansion of the globe. Our
         previous studies have shown that the optic nerve (ON) traction force exerted on the
         eye globe during eye movements could deform the optic nerve head (ONH), and
         such effects were more pronounced in adduction than in abduction.18–20 Moreover,
         the ON traction force is on the same order of magnitude as the extraocular muscle
         forces and acting along the axial direction.21 Based on the above observations, we
         hypothesized that the ON traction force could play a role in axial elongation in
         myopia.21
                   The ON traction force during eye movements is determined by many factors,
         including the stiffness, morphology, microstructural collagenous organization,22 and
         spatial arrangements of ocular tissues.21 Although it is not yet feasible to measure
         the ON traction force in vivo, the morphology and the displacements of the eye globe
         and ON during eye movements can be assessed with magnetic resonance imaging
         (MRI). These factors may reflect the magnitude and the effects of ON traction. While
         our group and others have studied ON morphology in glaucoma eyes20,23, no studies
         have yet investigated ON morphology and displacements in HM subjects.
                   The aim of this study was to compare the differences in the morphology and
         displacement patterns of the globe and ON during eye movements in normal and HM
         eyes.

                   Twenty HM subjects and 18 healthy emmetropic controls were included in this
         study. All HM subjects had at least one eye with an axial length of > 27 mm on
         partial coherence interferometry (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc, Dublin, CA) and a clinical
         diagnosis of staphyloma. HM subjects underwent a complete clinical examination
         including dilated fundus examination, B-scan ultrasonography (Quantel Aviso,
         Rockwall, TX) and swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT, DRI OCT-
         1, Atlantis, Topcon, Oakland, NJ). All subjects had a best-corrected visual acuity of
         20/40 or greater in at least one eye.
                   Staphylomas were classified into four types by a single grader (QVH):
         macular staphyloma (Type-1), posterior pole staphyloma (Type-2), compound
         staphyloma (Type-3; two bulges) and peripapillary staphyloma (Type-4).
                   This study complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
         Act of 1996 and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Institutional
         Review Board (IRB)/Ethnics Committee approval was obtained from Columbia
         University. All patients signed a written consent form before initiation of the study-
         specific procedures.
         Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Processing
                   Each subject’s orbital regions were imaged with a Phillips 3T Achieva scanner
         with an 8-channel phased-array head coil using a fat-suppressed, axial T2-weighted
         volumetric scanning sequence (1024 x 1024 matrix, number of slices = 50, pixel size
         = 0.215 mm, slice thickness = 1.0 mm, TR = 4000 ms, TE = 475 ms). Figure 1A and
         1B show representative axial MRI images obtained in this study.
                   During the MRI procedure, the subjects were instructed to direct their gaze on
         one of the three visual targets viewable via a standard head-coil-based mirror,

         allowing image acquisition in the primary position (baseline), and on left and right
         gaze of 15°.
         MRI Volume Processing
                   MRI volumes of both eyes for each subject in primary gaze, abduction and
         adduction of 15° were analysed. All MRI volumes were resampled from
         1024×1024×50 to 1024×1024×200 voxels to obtain a smoother representation of the
         ON boundaries. Left and right gaze MRI volumes were reoriented to align with the
         baseline volume to remove any possible head rotation and to allow comparison of
         globe and ON positions in the same coordinate system. The reorientation included
         rigid translation and rotation transformations of the MRI volume with Amira (version
         6.0; FEI) using a voxel-based algorithm that maximized mutual information between
         two given volumes.24 In the reorientation process, the orbital regions were cropped
         out to remove the effects of eye rotations on the 3D volume registration, allowing a
         precise alignment of MRI volumes solely using the landmarks of the brain. Images
         were manually-segmented in coronal, axial and sagittal views to isolate both the
         globe and ON pixels (Figures 1C,1D).
         Measurements of Eye Globe Length and Displacements
                   The length of each globe was measured from 3D MRI scans automatically
         using delineated images, which was used as a surrogate for the axial length. In this
         study, MRI-based globe length measurements correlated well with axial length
         measurements obtained by IOLMaster.
                   Globe displacements were calculated based on the location of the globe
         center at each gaze positions. The globe center was defined as the geometric center
         of all segmented globe pixels.
         Measurements of ON Tortuosity

                   First, each ON was sliced by around 100 coronal slices (0.215 mm apart). For
         each coronal slice, we computed the geometric center from the ON contour points
         within that plane.
                   All obtained points (geometric centers) were then fitted to a 3D curve (spline)
         to form the ON central line (Figure 1E). The tortuosity of the ON was defined as the
         length of the ON central line segment (15 mm long from the globe-ON junction)
         divided by the distance between the two end-points. The adjusted ON tortuosity was
         defined as the ON tortuosity, but estimated prior to the onset of myopia. For instance,
         for a given HM eye, the adjusted ON tortuosity represents the tortuosity of the ON
         when the eye had a normal axial length at a prior point in time before the onset of
         myopia. It was defined as the length of the ON central line segment (15 mm) divided
         by a hypothetical distance of this ON segment when the axial length was normal
         (22.84 mm, the average value of all normal eyes). Conservative assumptions were
         made to ensure we did not under-estimate such adjusted tortuosity values. See
         supplementary material A for further details.
         Measurements of ON Displacement
                   ON displacements were evaluated in 4 quasicoronal planes (spaced in 3 mm
         intervals), which were oriented perpendicular to the ON central line in primary gaze
         (Figure 1F). Specifically, on each plane, the shift of the ON central line at each gaze
         position was calculated along the naso-temporal (X) and supero-inferior (Z) axes.
         Measurements of ON Insertion Angle
                   The ON insertion angle was defined as the angle between the limbal plane
         and the ON insertion plane, which should correlate to the clinical observation of optic
         nerve disc tilt. The limbal plane was defined by a 2D plane that was fit through the
         limbus and center of the lens in MRI volumetric renderings using an automatic

         algorithm (Figure 2A).25 The ON insertion plane was defined by fitting a plane to
         peripapillary scleral points within a 4-mm in diameter region centered on the ON-
         globe junction (Figure 2B).
         Statistics
                   All measured parameters were compared between control and HM eyes. As
         data from both eyes were used, a linear mixed model was employed to adjust for
         inter-eye correlations. Correlations between ON insertion angles and other
         parameters were also evaluated using linear mixed models. A Tukey's multiple
         comparison test was used to compare insertion angles among different staphyloma
         types in HM eyes. All statistical analyses were performed using R (R Foundation,
         Vienna, Austria). P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
         RESULTS
         Subjects
                   For this study, 18 normal controls (10 female and 8 male) and 20 HM (12
         female and 8 male) subjects were included. The age of normal and HM subjects was
         26.57±2.35 and 55.80±15.49 years, respectively. The axial length of HM cases
         (28.62±2.60 mm) was significantly greater than that of normal controls (22.84±0.89
         mm) (P<0.0001). For HM eyes, there were 9 Type-1, 17 Type-2, 6 Type-3, 1 Type-4
         staphylomas and 7 with no staphyloma.
         ON Morphology
                   Figure 3 shows the relative location of the averaged ON central lines within
         the sagittal plane of control and HM subjects in primary gaze, after referencing all
         eyes to the same ON-globe junction. ONs of HM subjects were located more

         inferiorly than those of emmetropic controls. Specifically, in the 3 coronal planes that
         are located 5, 10, and 15 mm posterior to the ON-globe junction, the supero-inferior
         location of ONs was statistically different between two groups (p < 0.0001).
                   Raw (top panel) and adjusted (bottom panel) ON tortuosities in baseline,
         adduction, and abduction of 15º are summarized in Figure 4 for both groups. In all
         gaze positions, the ON tortuosities of HM eyes were always significantly higher than
         those of the emmetropic controls (average value for all gaze positions: 1.0436 ±
         0.0418 in HM eyes versus 1.0151 ± 0.01917 in controls). The adjusted ON
         tortuosities of HM eyes were significantly lower than those of the emmetropic
         controls in primary gaze (0.9063 ± 0.0591 versus 1.0152 ± 0.02981), adduction
         (0.9023 ± 0.05538 versus 1.0137 ± 0.0299) and abduction (0.9100 ± 0.0594 versus
         1.0182 ± 0.0316); p<0.0001 for all cases.
         Globe Displacements
                   In the naso-temporal (X) direction (Figure 5A), globe displacement was
         significantly higher for emmetropic eyes in both adduction and abduction. However,
         in the antero-posterior (Y) and supero-inferior (Z) directions, no statistical significant
         differences were found between the emmetropic controls and HM eyes (Figures 5B,
         5C).
         ON Displacements
                   In all eyes, ON displacements in adduction were significantly different from
         those in abduction in the naso-temporal direction (p<0.0001 in all 4 planes) but not in
         the supero-inferior direction (p>0.26) (Table 1). ON moving distances (without
         considering directions) in the axial plane were similar in adduction and abduction
         (p>0.28 in all 4 planes). ON displacements in plane 3 and 4 were smaller in the HM

         group in both gaze directions and were larger in plane 1 in adduction only (Table 2
         and Figure 6).
         ON Insertion Angle
                   The ON insertion angle was 15.26 ± 3.72° for emmetropic and 25.68 ± 8.01°
         for HM eyes (p<0.001, Figure 7A). In myopic eyes, the ON insertion angle in Type-2
         staphyloma was significantly different from eyes with no significant staphyloma
         (Figure 7B). The ON insertion angle was positively correlated with both ON
         tortuosity (Figure 7C) and with axial length (Figure 7D).
                   In adduction, temporal translation of the globe increased with an increasing
         insertion angle (p = 0.006). Globe displacements in other directions were not
         correlated with ON insertion angle.
                   A larger insertion angle was correlated with a smaller ON displacements in
         plane 2 (adduction: p=0.04; abduction: p=0.009), plane 3 (adduction: p=0.03;
         abduction: p < 0.0001) and plane 4 (only in abduction: p=0.001).
         DISCUSSION
                   In this study, we evaluated the morphology and displacements of the globe
         and ON following horizontal eye movements in HM eyes and in healthy emmetropic
         controls. We found that the adjusted tortuosity of the ON was significantly lower in
         HM eyes, suggesting that eyes destined toward HM exhibited higher ON traction
         forces during eye movements before the onset of myopia. We have previously
         reported that the ON traction force was of the same order of magnitude as that of
         extraocular muscle forces and postulated that it may contribute to axial elongation in
         myopia.21 While we are unable to provide proofs to such speculations, our work

         provide a better understanding of the biomechanical forces acting on the posterior
         pole during eye movements in healthy and HM eyes.
                   In this study, we found that the adjusted ON tortuosity (i.e. the estimated
         tortuosity of the ON prior to the onset of myopia) was less in HM as compared to
         emmetropic control eyes, which may increase the ON traction force during eye
         movements if other factors remain unchanged. This could imply that at a prior point
         in time, a greater level of ON traction may have acted on the posterior pole thus
         encouraging axial elongation and myopia progression. However, at the present time,
         in HM eyes, the globe is excessively elongated, which therefore “relieved” some of
         the inherent ON traction. Even if at the present time HM eyes have more tortuous
         ONs than normal eyes, they may still be able to exhibit larger ON traction forces. For
         instance, for the same magnitude of eye movements, theoretically, the ON-globe
         junction needs to travel a longer distance in HM eyes when compared to normal
         eyes. This is indeed true in adduction from our measurements of ON location in the
         quasicoronal plane 1. Because the nonlinearity of ON traction force and orbital tissue
         resistance force, this protection effects of a more tortuous ON might be neutralized
         by a larger travel distance of ON-globe junction in HM eyes. Second, in HM eyes
         with staphyloma, the insertion of the ON onto the posterior scleral tends to be
         oblique (with the presence of a “tilted disc”). The location of the ON-globe junction
         would therefore be nasal to the posterior apex of the eye in most cases. This may
         cause the ON to wrap around the fulcrum of the posterior apex, especially in
         abduction for a large magnitude of eye movements. Additionally, depending on the
         location of the staphyloma, this may result in an even more extreme, posteriorly-
         displaced apex around which the ON must traverse during horizontal eye
         movements.

                   In this study, we chose to focus on the metric of ON disc tilt severity
         (objectively measured by assessing ON insertion angle), since it should reflect both
         axial length and distortion from staphyloma. We found that in HM eyes, the ON
         insertion angle in Type-2 (posterior pole) staphyloma was significantly greater than in
         HM eyes with no significant staphyloma (Figure 7B). This is consistent with the fact
         that the Type-1 (macular) staphylomas may have their ridges all temporal to the ON.
         Type-4 (peripapillary) and Type-3 (compound) staphyloma encompasses a great
         variety of possible ridge locations, so both of these types were limited by sample size
         for this particular analysis. We also found that the ON insertion angle was positively
         correlated with ON tortuosity (Figure 7C), axial length (Figure 7D) and temporal
         translation of the globe in adduction. Additionally, the ON insertion angle was
         negatively correlated with ON displacements in plane 2, plane 3 and plane 4 (only in
         abduction). These observations showed that the greater the disc tilt (and greater the
         insertion angle), the less taut the ON and the less the ON would move, suggesting
         that ON traction might be relieved by the increased in insertion angle. Therefore, it is
         possible that disc tilt is a compensatory mechanism of the eye to mitigate the effects
         of a large ON traction force during eye movements. It is also plausible that disc tilt is
         the consequence of continuous stretching of peripapillary tissues following repeated
         eye movements. The complexity of eye movement patterns in association with
         variations in eye and orbit anatomy may contribute to the variety of tilting directions
         and tilting severity among HM subjects, but this remains to be confirmed.
                   In emmetropic controls, the course of the optic nerve is oblique in the sagittal
         plane (Figure 3). Specifically, from the ON-globe junction, the ON travels towards
         the orbit apex posteriorly and superiorly, showing a typical ON course in the orbit.
         However, ONs were located more inferiorly in HM subjects compared with those in

         normal controls. It could be possible that in HM eyes, ONs were pushed posteriorly
         due to eye elongation and pulled inferiorly due to gravity (on average people spend
         2/3 of their time with upright position). Under the combined effects of these two
         forces, the redundant ON moved inferiorly. The effects of ON location on the
         biomechanical environment of the globe in HM subjects are unknowns, and future
         computational modelling studies incorporating ON position may provide insights.
                   In emmetropic control eyes, the globe translated medially in adduction and
         laterally in abduction, which is in consistent with previous studies.23 However, in HM
         eyes, naso-temporal globe translation was significantly smaller than that in controls.
         It is possible that longer HM eyes experienced a larger resistance force from the
         orbital tissues during eye movements, resulting in a smaller globe translation. In the
         anterior-posterior direction, differences in globe translation between the two groups
         were not statistically significant although on average HM eyes had a larger globe
         retraction.
                   In adduction, ON displacements of HM subjects in planes 3 and 4 were
         smaller than those of emmetropic control eyes but the displacement of the ON-globe
         junction was larger, indicating that the displacements of the ON were more
         concentrated in the ON anterior segment in HM subjects. In abduction, a similar
         trend was observed. This should not be surprising, as the ON is relatively more
         “slack” in HM subjects. The pulling of the ON during eye movements would first
         eliminate the slack of the ON anterior segment before involving its most posterior
         part.
                   The ON, curved in 3D, exhibits a curvature in the sagittal plane and such a
         curvature differs between HM and emmetropic controls. From a pure mechanical
         point of view, in adduction or abduction, ON straightening in 3D could lead to vertical

         displacements of the ON. However, we found that the vertical displacements were
         almost null and no differences were found between HM and controls (Table 1). This
         indicates that horizontal eye movements only induce ON displacements in the
         horizontal plane. Therefore, a 2D axial slice of the eye should be sufficient to capture
         the ON displacements during horizontal eye movements. This is of high interest,
         because 2D MRI (rather than 3D) allows a much higher temporal resolution, enabling
         real-time imaging of eye movements.
                   As myopia is associated with near work, it has been proposed that
         accommodation is involved in myopia progression. Studies have also shown that
         convergence or other types of eye movement alone could induce transient axial
         elongation.14–16 Furthermore, reduction of convergence at near work by wearing
         prismatic lens is protective against myopic progression.26 Axial elongation during
         accommodation is likely related to the inward mechanical pulling force acting on the
         corneoscleral shell by the ciliary muscle. However, the mechanisms of convergence-
         induced axial elongation are unclear. We speculated that convergence-induced eye
         movements of both eyes could lead to a large ON traction force, especially in
         viewing near subjects.
                   In this study, several limitations warrant further discussion. First, age was not
         matched between two groups. It is possible that the degeneration of ocular tissues
         may affect ON displacement patterns. In spite of this limitation, we still believe this
         dataset provides us with an improved understanding of the behavior of ON
         displacements induced by eye movements. Second, we only evaluated the tortuosity
         and displacement of the anterior segment (15 mm long) of the intraorbital ON
         because of the low visibility of the posterior segment with MRI. Moreover, the full ON
         length was not measured. It is noted that the intraorbital ON length may be a very

         important factor that influences ON stretching during eye movement. Future studies
         should include this important parameter whenever possible. Third, eye rotation
         angles were 15º in this study. However, in the horizontal plane, human eyes can
         rotate up to ±50 º in daily activities.27 For a larger magnitude of eye movements, the
         ON will be fully straightened and stretched. The effects of a larger magnitudes of eye
         movement need to be further explored.
                   In conclusion, the adjusted tortuosity of the ON was significantly lower in HM
         eyes, suggesting that eyes destined toward HM exhibited higher ON traction forces
         during eye movements before the onset of myopia. Our ON metrics may be valuable
         to explore a potential link between eye movements and axial elongation.

         Figure 2. (A) The optic nerve (ON) insertion angle was defined as the angle
         between the normal from the limbal plane (blue) and that from the ON insertion plane
         (red). The limbal plane was defined by a 2D plane that was fit through the limbus and
         center of the lens from MRI volumetric renderings using an automatic algorithm. (B)
         The ON insertion plane was defined by fitting a plane to peripapillary scleral points
         contained within a 4-mm in diameter region centered on the ON-globe junction

         onset of myopia at a prior point in time.
                   The tortuosity of the ON (non-adjusted) was defined as the length of the ON
         central line segment (15 mm long from the globe-ON junction) divided by the
         distance between the two end-points A and B (L/D1 in Figure).
                   The adjusted ON tortuosity was defined as the length of the ON central line
         segment (15 mm) divided by the distance between points A’ and B’. Points A’ and B’
         were the hypothetical locations of points A and B at a prior point in time before the
         onset of myopia. The distance between A and A’ (D2) was set as 77% of the axial
         length increase compared to a normal eye (axial length: 22.84 mm) because

         proptosis also occurs during eye elongation.1 As only half of the whole ON was used
         in tortuosity calculations, the distance between B and B’ was set as half of the ONH
         displacement (D2) by assuming that the ON “stretch” is evenly distributed along the
         whole ON length (30 mm) when moving point A to A’.
                   Note that the tortuosity of the anterior segment of the ON is usually larger
         than that of the posterior half, thus the distance between B and B’ should be less
         than half of D2 or even near zero. Therefore, for a given HM eye, the adjusted
         tortuosity value is very conservative and should represent the upper limit of all
         possible tortuosity values prior to the onset of myopia.
