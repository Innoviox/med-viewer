22     Abstract
23     Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic is currently the most significant global public
24     health challenge, with more than 31 million cases reported to date. Colombia first
25     reported COVID-19 cases in the country by early March 2020, and six months later
26     it has reached ~750,471 clinical cases, with significant regional differences in
27     morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization rates.
28     Aims: Identify population characteristics and hospital capacity in the 13
29     municipalities with the highest disease notification and examine differences in
30     cumulative reported cases, hospitalization, and mortality rates that may explain the
31     regional differences.
32     Materials and methods: A multi-group ecological study was performed based on
33     the      information            available         from      public      databases.          Notification      of     cases,
34     hospitalization, and crude mortality and age-adjusted rates were calculated.
35     Results: The municipalities with the highest COVID-1 burden at different times
36     during the study period displayed significant differences in population density and
37     the proportion of elderly inhabitants, indigenous and afro descendants minorities;
38     indices of unsatisfied basic needs and multidimensional poverty index, as well as the
39     number of hospital beds. Likewise, essential variations in notification rates,
40     hospitalization, and mortality were observed. The highest age-adjusted of reported
41     cases (4,219 cases) and mortality (230.4 cases) rates were found in Leticia, the
42     lowest general hospitalization rates in Buenaventura (37.5 cases) and the lowest
43     ICU hospitalization rates (0) in Leticia and Tumaco due to a lack of these units in
44     these municipalities.

52     Introduction
53     Currently, COVID-19 pandemics represent the most significant health challenge for
54     humanity, with ~31 million clinical cases reported to date (Sept 22, 2020) and
55     ~965,000 deaths in 235 countries worldwide (1,2). The disease is produced caused
56     by SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus that induces a pleomorphic and broad range of
57     clinical       manifestations.              Infected       subjects        may       evolve    without        symptoms
58     (asymptomatic) or develop mild, severe, and critical clinical cases frequently leading
59     to death, particularly in elder patients with some comorbidities i.e. hypertension,
60     cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, obesity, cancer, among other pathologies (3).
61     The virus reached Colombia by early March 2020. A week later, the national
62     government declared an almost full nationwide lockdown, except for essential
63     services including the food industry and markets, pharmacies, and banks. Although
64     the prompt lockdown significantly delayed SARS-CoV2 dissemination, fifteen days
65     after virus entry in Colombia it caused the first COVID-19 death.
66
67     Initially, government efforts to provide early diagnosis, hospital facilities, and
68     personal protective equipment (PPE) faced a severe global shortage of equipment,
69     supplies, reagents, and adequate preparedness with confronting the COVID-19
70     challenge; therefore, a full lockdown was almost the only effective alternative. Total
71     lockdown officially extended for about two months. As expected, its economic impact
72     prompted the initiation on May 4 of gradual reopening, which has been associated
73     with an immediate and progressive increase in the number of cases and deaths. As
74     of September 18, a total of 750,471 confirmed cases and 23,850 deaths have been
75     reported. During the first three months, 77,2% of the COVID-19 cases occurred in

76     ten municipalities located in well-defined regions across the country: Bogotá,
77     Cartagena, Cali, Barranquilla, Medellín, Leticia, Soledad, Villavicencio, Tumaco, and
78     Buenaventura; however, during the last three months, Montería, Valledupar, and
79     Bucaramanga replaced Leticia, Tumaco, and Buenaventura. In this second phase,
80     the new top ten municipalities, each with its own geographic, demographic, social,
81     economic, and cultural characteristics, accounted for 63.2% of the cases.
82     Here, we report analyses focused on the characteristics of the most affected
83     populations and hospital beds capacity in the top ten municipalities that have
84     reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases to date, and examine reported case
85     rates, hospitalizations and mortality between March 6 and September 18, 2020.
86
87     Materials and Methods
88     Type of study: A multi-group ecological analysis was performed based on the
89     information available from public databases on morbidity, mortality, and hospital bed
90     availability.
91     Geographical coverage: The thirteen study municipalities are broadly dispersed
92     across the Colombian national geography. Barranquilla, Soledad, Monteria,
93     Valledupar, and Cartagena are located in the northern region on the Caribbean
94     coast, whereas Cali, Buenaventura, and Tumaco are in the western part, close or on
95     the Pacific coast region. Bogotá, Bucaramanga, and Medellín are in the Andean
96     zone, whereas Villavicencio is in the Eastern region, and Leticia in the southernmost
97     town on the Amazon river (Figure 1).
98     Information sources: The 2018 Colombian national census conducted by the
99     Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadisticas (DANE) was used to

100     describe the characteristics of the population of each of the study municipalities (4).
101     The indices of Unsatisfied Basic Needs (UBN) (4) and the multidimensional poverty
102     measure (MPI) of each municipality (5) were used to determine the level of socio-
103     economic vulnerability. The Special Registry of Health Service Providers (SRHSP;
104     June 5 and September 18) of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MSP),
105     was used to identify the capacity of hospital beds (6); and the open Data Bases of
106     the Ministry of Information and Communications Technologies (MICT), Colombian
107     (June 5 and September 18), were used to establish the number of people diagnosed
108     with COVID-19, those who became ill, hospitalized and died, by municipality (7).
109     Variables: municipality, total population, and population density, the average number
110     of people per household, age median, older than 64 years, sex, ethnic self-
111     recognition, socio-economic status, educational level, marital status, beds per
112     100,000 inhabitants, number of cases, dates of symptoms onset and deaths, age
113     and medical care.
114     Data analyses: The information obtained was processed in Microsoft Excel
115     spreadsheets and analyzed with the Stata Version 12 program. COVID-19 frequency
116     and percentage, as well as notification, mortality and hospitalization were estimated.
117     The crude and age-adjusted rates of COVID-19 reports and mortality were analyzed;
118     likewise, hospitalization rates were assessed. All rates were expressed per 100,000
119     inhabitants. For the adjustment of notification and mortality rates by age, the direct
120     methods were considered using the World Health Organization (WHO) standard
121     population as reference (8). Spearman correlation coefficients between mortality
122     adjusted rate, and each of the socio-economic indicators, health providers, and
123     hospital beds were calculated.

125     Results
126     The Colombian population is estimated as 50,372,424 inhabitants (9), 36.4% of
127     whom are in the municipalities analyzed between March and September. Population
128     density varied between 9 inhabitants/km2 in Leticia (Amazon) and 9,926
129     inhabitants/km2 in Soledad (Caribbean). The proportion of people older than 64
130     years was highest in Cali (11.6%) and lowest in Leticia (4.3%). The indigenous
131     population was highest in Leticia (42.5%), whereas the Afro-descendant population
132     was predominant in Buenaventura (85.3%) and Tumaco (81.5%) located on the
133     Pacific coast. Both UBN and MPI were highest in Tumaco (27.5% and 53.7%,
134     respectively), and lowest in Bogotá (3.4% and 9.0%, respectively) (Table 1). The
135     number of ICU beds per 100,000 inhabitants was highest in Valledupar (78.6 beds),
136     whereas Leticia and Tumaco did not have any (0 beds) during most of the study
137     period (Table 2). There was a significant variation in the adjusted notification of
138     COVID-19 among the study municipalities; it was highest in Leticia (4,219 cases)
139     and lowest in Medellín (26.6 cases) (Figure 2). The age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality
140     rate was highest in Leticia (230.4) and lowest in Medellín (36.6) (Figure 2).

146     (MICT), Colombian (June 5 and September 18), were used to establish the number
147     of people diagnosed with COVID-19, those who became ill, hospitalized and died,
148     by municipality (7).
149
150     The Leticia, Buenaventura, and Tumaco municipalities displayed case peaks
151     between March and June (Figure 3). In contrast, for Bogotá, Medellín, Cali,
152     Barranquilla, Soledad, Montería, Valledupar, and Bucaramanga the peak was
153     between June and September. In comparison, Cartagena and Villavicencio
154     presented peaks between March and September. Spearman correlation indicated a
155     statistical significance between the adjusted rate of mortality and case notification,
156     population, age median age, percentage of population older than 65 years, another
157     ethnic group (white/mestizo), education level superior and no education, UBN, MPI
158     and number of health services providers, whereas between March and September
159     it correlated only with having a partner (Table 3).

163     Discussion
164     Despite the government’s efforts and the remarkable contribution of the population
165     to the individual recommended protective measures such as social distancing and
166     mask usage, and the general closedown, currently Colombia is the sixth country with
167     the highest morbidity and eleventh in mortality attributed to COVID-19 worldwide (1).
168     Regardless of severity, during a pandemic the burden on health services is great

169     and exposes any weakness of the system (10). Furthermore, maintaining
170     sustainable critical care services is a crucial consideration for the health system (11).
171     The analyses reported in this study revealed significant variations in the notification
172     of both general and ICU hospitalizations and mortality rates in the most affected
173     municipalities during the six months study period. Whereas Leticia, with the highest
174     proportion of the indigenous population with the highest MPI, displayed one of the
175     highest rates of COVID-19 hospitalization and death rates, Medellín showed the
176     lowest notification and mortality rates. These differences correlate with the socio-
177     economic conditions of both municipalities. In Leticia, a large part of the indigenous
178     population has a high degree of socio-economic marginalization, living in distant and
179     isolated areas of the Amazon forest region, and communities are exposed to several
180     factors that endanger their health status (12). In this region, search for medical care
181     demands traveling long distances, usually using primitive, inefficient, and expensive
182     transportation means, which are consequently time-consuming, notably affecting
183     subsistence and loss of work. These hurdles result in increased time between
184     symptoms onset and adequate medical care, which is usually provided in primitive
185     health service conditions (13). Although the isolation of these communities from the
186     main population center of Colombia likely delayed the arrival of COVID-19, its
187     proximity to Tabatinga, the closest town on the Brazilian border, and Santa Rosa de
188     Yavari on the Peruvian border, might have accelerated the disease (virus) arrival to
189     this isolated region where health infrastructure was not prepared for the pandemic.
190     Second, people were skeptical about the real danger of the disease (14).
191     When comparing the municipalities of the Caribbean (Cartagena, Barranquilla and
192     Soledad) and the Pacific (Buenaventura and Tumaco) coasts, remarkable

193     differences were also observed. While the Caribbean has a high population density,
194     better socio-economic conditions, and better hospital infrastructure, the Pacific
195     region is populated by Afro-descendant minorities, traditionally affected by poverty
196     (15) with poor housing infrastructure, malnutrition and limited access to health care
197     (16,17). Afro-descendant communities are predominant in the Pacific regions. It is
198     also possible that the difference due to ethnic self-recognition is attributable to the
199     access that this population may have to care in health services (18); however, the
200     concept of ethnicity is linked to its own historical, political, and social baggage (19).
201     In general, biological susceptibility, geographic, socio-economic, and cultural
202     factors, along with pre-existing health conditions and access to medical care, can
203     help explain the higher rates of infection and death in people of African descent
204     (19,20). On the other hand, indigenous populations are predominant in the Amazon
205     and Pacific regions. Both minorities displayed significantly more cases than mestizo
206     populations predominant in the rest of the country.
207     The differences in morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19, associated with
208     economic and social conditions, have been described in racial and ethnic North
209     American minorities (21). Social, economic, and cultural differences reported here
210     are similar to those presented by Wadhera et al., who found that ethnic minorities
211     living in poverty in New York, who have a low educational level, had higher COVID-
212     19 hospitalization and related mortality (22). Furthermore, in Colombia another
213     study that evaluated the influence of poverty and inequity on COVID-19 found that
214     the income losses induced by the closedown affected significantly more the
215     vulnerable sectors (23).

216     Regarding the provision of health services, there was a great variation in those of
217     general hospitalization and ICU hospitalization in the 13 municipalities. Much of the
218     variation could be related to NBI and MPI levels. This variation in the provision of
219     health services occurred both within and between municipalities. In the last month
220     efforts have been made to minimize these variations aimed at guaranteeing
221     adequate access for the entire population and avoiding the excessive use of
222     potentially expensive resources.
223     The results presented here should be interpreted with caution. These are partial
224     results prior to September 18, 2020; these trends may be currently changing
225     according to the evolution of the disease in the population. As for hospital and ICU
226     services, this study was an attempt to measure their supply. It is possible that the
227     municipalities where the greatest burden of the disease was reported are not the
228     most representative of the socio-economic conditions of the regions to which they
229     belong. In conclusion, the probability of getting sick, hospitalization, and death from
230     COVID-19 between municipalities may be related to socio-economic characteristics
231     and the local capacity of hospital beds. Populations with worse conditions bear the
232     greatest burden of disease. The results presented can contribute to data-based
233     decision-making related to the availability of health services affected by morbidity
234     and mortality due to COVID-19 and, in particular, the optimal capacity of hospital
235     services and ICUs.
