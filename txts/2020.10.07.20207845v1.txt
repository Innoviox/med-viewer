              Background: Isolation of infected people and their contacts may be an effective way to control
              outbreaks of infectious disease, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Models can provide insights
              into the efficacy of contact tracing, coupled with isolating or quarantining at risk people.
              Methods: We developed an agent-based model and simulated 15, 000 short term illnesses, with
              varying characteristics. For each illness we ran ten simulations on the following scenarios: (1) No
              tracing or isolation (None), (2) isolation of agents who have tested positive (Isolation), (3) scenario
              2 coupled with minimal contact tracing and quarantine of contacts (Minimum), (4) scenario 3 with
              more effective contact tracing (Moderate), and (5) perfect isolation of agents who test positive and
              perfect tracing and quarantine of all their contacts (Maximum).
              Results: The median total infections of the Isolation, Minimum, Moderate and Maximum scenarios
              were 80%, 40%, 17% and 4% of the no intervention scenario respectively.
              Conclusions: Isolation of infected patients and quarantine of their contacts, even if moderately well
              implemented, is likely to substantially reduce the number of infections in an outbreak. Randomized
              controlled trials to confirm these results in the real world and to analyse the cost effectiveness of
              contact tracing and isolation during coronavirus and influenza outbreaks are warranted.

    1 Introduction
    Several non-pharmaceutical interventions have been introduced in different countries to reduce the spread of the
    SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Some of these have included lockdowns, physical distancing rules, prolific use of hand
    sanitisers, and mask-wearing [1, 2, 3].
    In some countries, such as South Korea, a key intervention has been tracing the contacts of infected people so that they
    can isolate or quarantine themselves [4, 5]. Indeed, preparation for tracking coronavirus outbreaks was in place in South
    Korea long before the emergence of Covid-19 [6].
    Isolation refers to the movement of people with the infection being restricted, voluntarily or legally, while quarantine
    refers to the movement of people at risk of infection being restricted, voluntarily or legally. The work described here
    does not differentiate between these distinctions. We therefore use isolation to refer interchangeably to isolation or
    quarantine, whether voluntarily undertaken or legally enforced.
    Besides coronaviruses, contact tracing has also been implemented to control tuberculosis, hepatitis and HIV and other
    sexually transmitted infections [7, 8, 9, 10]. But these are rather different illnesses to Covid-19, generally infecting

           Isolation of infected people and their contacts is likely to be effective against many short-term epidemics     A P REPRINT
    patients for longer and spreading slower through populations. It is also not usually ethical or practical to expect people
   with a long-duration infection to isolate.
    Contact tracing has to a limited extent also been used to control influenza outbreaks [11, 12]. Contact tracing was a
   “critical intervention” in the Liberian Ebola epidemic of 2014-2015 and “represented one of the largest contact tracing
    efforts during an epidemic in history” [13].
   This raises the question: How effective is contact tracing coupled with isolation (CTI) at controlling outbreaks of
    short duration illnesses such as those associated with coronaviruses and influenza? And how well implemented must
    contact tracing and isolation be? After all, CTI is potentially a far less costly and intrusive way of controlling dangerous
    illnesses than lockdowns, though both together may be necessary in some situations.
    It’s impossible to provide a precise answer to this question. Infection outbreaks have practically infinite variations and
    are extraordinarily complex and stochastic. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown, human populations are highly
    heterogeneous and it’s hard to predict how even a suburb, let alone a city or country, will be affected by an outbreak.
    Nevertheless models, in particular agent-based ones, can provide insight into infectious disease dynamics [15, 16], and
    particularly the effectiveness of CTI versus isolation only of infected people versus no contact tracing or isolation at all.
    If simulations of human populations can show us that under a wide variety of assumptions, CTI is likely to be beneficial
    then it is worth implementing CTI in response to dangerous infection outbreaks.
    2 Methodology
   We simulated thousands of short duration illnesses with the following model world:
            • A population of 10, 000 agents is initiated with ten randomly infected agents. The remaining agents are in a
               Susceptible state.
            • Infected agents are initially in an Exposed state. They then advance to an Infectious Asymptomatic state.
              Then they advance either to an Infectious Symptomatic or Recovered state. An agent that has advanced to the
               Infectious Symptomatic stage advances to the Recovered state. 1
            • Uninfected agents may become exposed if they are adjacent to one of k neighbouring agents in one of the two
               infectious states. Each uninfected agent has its own susceptibility to being infected by its neighbours. Each
               infected agents also has its own level of infectiousness.
            • Agents are tested for the infection with a specified probability per day depending on the state they are in. The
               test result becomes known an average of a specified number of days later.
            • Agents that test positive may be placed in isolation for a fixed number of days in which case they are less
               likely to become infected. Each agent has its own adherence level to isolation which is factored into its risk of
               being infected. There is a continuum of isolation adherence that affects the risk of infection.
            • If an agent is one of the k adjacent neighbours of an agent whose test result is known it may be traced with a
               specified probability. If it is successfully traced it is also placed into isolation.
            • We assume we are interested in highly contagious diseases with at most a single digit infection mortality rate,
               such as SARS-CoV-2 or influenza, and unlike MERS or Ebola (though our work can easily be extended to
               examine these as well). Hence we have not factored death into the simulations.
   Thus the risk of infection of an uninfected agent, a, that comes into contact with an infectious one, b, is a stochastic
    function of the susceptibility to infection of a, the infectiousness of b and the isolation of a and b.
   A simulation runs as follows: First the agents are initialized. Then for 500 iterations, where each iteration represents a
    day, the following events take place: new infections, testing, isolation, de-isolation (for agents who have been isolated
    for the specified number of days), tracing, and finally disease progression.
   The simulation engine has the algorithmic form described in Listing 1.
        1
          While our simulation program can handle hospitalisation, intensive care and death states, we decided that this was unnecessary
    complexity for our purposes here.
                                                                       2

           End
       End
   This structure is based on [14].
    By design our model, named HETGEN, encompasses extremely heterogeneous and stochastic agent behaviour: (1)
    each agent has its own susceptibility when uninfected, and infectiousness when infected, (2) infected agents traverse
    through the infection stages stochastically, (3) agents have their own isolation adherence parameter, (4) agents get
    tested stochastically but infected symptomatic agents are much more likely to get tested, (5) tracing occurs when an
    infected agent’s test is returned with a positive result, and (6) tracing, too is stochastic, with a success probability for
    each contact.
    Listing 2 is the pseudo-code for the infection algorithm.

                  if r < x
                     Set b’s state to Exposed
                  End
              End
           End
       End
   The infection function, f in Listing 2 for two agents, a and b, where a is infectious and b is susceptible, i is a property
    between 0 and 1 of a and b measuring their adherence to isolation, t is the infectious of a, and s is the susceptibility of
    b, is as follows:
                                                      min(1 − ai , 1 − bi )(at + bs )/2                                              (1)
   This unstructured model is designed to contrast, and complement, a highly structured model we have previously
    described that was designed to capture specific characteristics of Covid-19 and the effect of CTI on reducing SARS-
    CoV-2 infections in a South African township in which some agents attend schools, some work, some use taxis, and all
    live in households which are located in neighbourhood blocks, with each of these settings conferring different risks.[18]
    2.1 Scenarios
   We compared five scenarios:
    None There is no isolation or contact tracing.
    Isolation There is only isolation of agents with positive test results, with 85% mean adherence per day.
    Minimum There is isolation of agents with positive tests results with 85% mean adherence per day, and 10% of their
               contacts are traced and isolated with 85% mean adherence per day.
    Moderate There is isolation of agents with positive results with 85% adherence per day, and 30% of their contacts are
               traced and isolated with 85% mean adherence per day.
    Maximum There is perfect isolation of agents when they test positive and perfect tracing of contacts of their contacts,
               who are then also perfectly isolated.

    2.2 Limitations
   While the model encompasses a wide variety of variables for a wide number of possible illnesses, it is merely a computer
    simulation and cannot capture all real-world dynamics. Also the search space of possible illnesses, even with the limited
    number of variables we have perturbed, is massive (indistinguishable from infinity for practical purposes). 15, 000
    illnesses represents a tiny fraction of the search space. Nevertheless our sample should be large enough to draw tentative
    conclusions that inform policy, or at least further clinical research.
   A further limitation of the infection algorithm is that only the agents in the neighbourhood of an infectious agent can
    become infected. This algorithm, while more realistic than random or unassortative mixing ones, certainly doesn’t
    capture the complexity of real-world contacts. In future work we will explore compromises between assortative and
    unassortative mixing.
   Also there is no migration by agents into or out of our model-world.
   While this work may suggest that CTI can mitigate the spread of infectious disease, it offers no insight into how it can
    be implemented effectively.

    2.3 Programming
    Our model was prototyped in Python and then recoded, and further developed, in C++. This allowed us to run
    hundreds of thousands of simulations in several hours on affordable, standard consumer hardware. We recommend
    this methodology to other modellers who are welcome to use our code as a basis for this kind of simulation. The
    HETGEN source is available under the GNU General Public License version 3.0. Our code and results are available at
    https://github.com/nathangeffen/ABM_CTI.
    2.4 Calibration, R0 and wide range of infections
   To the extent that the model has been calibrated, it has been done experimentally. The values in Table 1 that are
    perturbed in 15, 000 sensitivity tests, have been set to go slightly beyond the range of reasonable estimates for influenza
    and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Those that are not perturbed have been set to what we hope are reasonable values.
    Because a practically infinite number of illnesses are encompassed in these values, many outbreaks do not have an
    R0 above 1 and fizzle out immediately. Others, on the other hand, have extremely high R0 values, with every agent
    becoming infected if no intervention takes place. Calculating R0 per simulation for such models in which the agents
    behave so heterogeneously is also not useful, with different methodologies giving widely different estimates. We
    therefore do an analysis of the results that includes all the simulations and sub-analyses that exclude those where fewer
    than 500 agents become infected.
    3 Results
   We calculated the mean, median and standard deviation over the ten runs of each of the 15, 000 sensitivity test for each
    of the five scenarios. Table 2 shows the results.
   As expected, the None scenario had the highest mean and median total infections, followed by Isolation, Minimum,
   Moderate and Maximum.
    Note that the median for the None scenario is higher than the mean, indicating that the mean is pulled down dispro-
    portionately by illnesses with low R0 that never become sizeable. By contrast the medians of the three most effective
    intervention scenarios are lower than the means, indicating that the means are increased disproportionately by epidemics
   with large R0 that, despite the intervention, still resulted in a large number of infections.

                                                  Maximum         994       273       1, 716
                                  Table 2: Results of the 15, 000 sensitivity tests using 10, 000 agents.
   Also useful is to know for how many illnesses each scenario outperformed the others. We compared scenarios using the
    mean of the ten runs for each illness. If an intervention has no effect, it should be outperformed by the None scenario
    approximately 7, 500 times (i.e. half of the 15, 000 illnesses). Using the mean of the ten runs per illness, the None
    scenario only outperformed the Isolation, Minimum, Moderate and Maximum interventions 2, 986, 828, 423 and 193
    times respectively. (Note: Whenever the None scenario beats another scenario, it is only due to the stochastic nature of
    the simulations.)
    Many illnesses never reach epidemic proportions or the difference between the interventions is small. We therefore
    did a further analysis of counting the number of times each scenario outperformed (or was outperformed by) the no
    intervention scenario if two criteria were met: (1) A mean of at least 500 agents were infected in the None scenario
    across the tens runs of an illness and (2) the better performing scenario had no more than 70% of the infections of the
    scenario it was being compared to. Using these criteria the None scenario only outperformed the Isolation, Minimum,
    Moderate and Maximum interventions 28, 2, 0 and 0 times respectively. It was outperformed by them 2, 020, 5, 406,
   7, 754 and 11, 392 times respectively. Making the second criterion even more stringent, by lowering it to 40%, resulted
    in the None scenario never outperforming any of the intervention scenarios. The intervention scenarios outperformed
    the None scenario 346, 2, 599, 5, 657 and 10, 585 times respectively.

            Isolation of infected people and their contacts is likely to be effective against many short-term epidemics  A P REPRINT
    4 Conclusions
    Our analysis suggests that if an infectious outbreak occurs with certain characteristics similar to influenza and SARS-
    CoV-2, even moderately well implemented CTI is likely to substantially reduce the ultimate number of infections. These
    characteristics are: (1) There must be a test for the illness with reasonable specificity and sensitivity for which results
    can be obtained in a few days. (2) A significant number of infectious people should present for the test, (3) the length
    of the illness should exceed the mean turnaround time for the test, and (4) the means to carry out contact tracing and
    isolation must exist. These characteristics are achievable for seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in many countries.
    Even moderately implemented isolation measures without tracing are likely to have a substantial benefit. This suggests
    that if people are, for example, strongly encouraged to stay at home if they have influenza symptoms during the influenza
    season, many infections, and consequently a substantial number of deaths, can be averted, even more so perhaps if
    entire households remain at home while one member is symptomatic with influenza. It’s conceivable that this may even
    reduce the total number of days absent from work during influenza season, though further research is needed to test this
    hypothesis.
    Randomized cluster-controlled clinical trials conceivably could test the efficacy of contact tracing. A Cochrane Review
    has pointed out the lack of contact tracing randomised trials for tuberculosis [17]. This gap in medical evidence
    applies to most infectious diseases. While models such as ours suggest that it is worthwhile investing in contact tracing
    infrastructure for infectious diseases, randomised trials can offer much clearer insight into the cost-effectiveness of CTI
    and its practical feasibility than models.
    Interestingly, because our model is highly heterogeneous and our analysis finds that, occasionally, even with the best
    possible implementation of CTI, there will be no benefit merely due to stochastic effects. We suspect this is a finding
   with real-world relevance. It is likely that in two similar settings, wherein no intervention is implemented in one, while
    a comprehensive CTI intervention is implemented in the other, the latter will, in a minority of occasions, have a worse
    epidemic, solely due to the stochastic nature of epidemics.
