Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has been characterised by periods of exponential growth and
decline, as different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are brought into play. During the early
uncontrolled phase of the outbreak (early March 2020) there was a period of prolonged exponential
growth with epidemiological observations such as hospitalisation doubling every 3-4 days (growth rate
r ≈ 0.2). The enforcement of strict lockdown measures led to a noticeable decline in all epidemic
quantities (r ≈ −0.06) that slowed during the summer as control measures were relaxed (r ≈ −0.02).
Since August, infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been rising (precise estimation of the cur-
rent growth rate is difficult due to extreme regional heterogeneity and temporal lags between the
different epidemiological observations) and various NPIs have been applied locally throughout the UK
in response.
Controlling any rise in infection is a compromise between public health and societal costs, with more
stringent NPIs reducing cases but damaging the economy and restricting freedoms. Currently, NPI
imposition is made in response to the epidemiological state, are of indefinite length and are often
imposed at short notice, greatly increasing the negative impact. An alternative approach is to consider
planned, limited duration periods of strict NPIs aiming to purposefully reduce prevalence before such
emergency NPIs are required. These “precautionary breaks” may offer a means of keeping control of
the epidemic, while their fixed duration and the forewarning may limit their society impact. Here, using
simple analysis and age-structured models matched to the unfolding UK epidemic, we investigate the
action of precautionary breaks. In particular we consider their impact on the prevalence of infection, as
well as the total number of predicted hospitalisations and deaths. We find that precautionary breaks
provide the biggest gains when the growth rate is low, but offer a much needed brake on increasing
infection when the growth rate is higher, potentially allowing other measures (such as contact tracing)
to regain control.

1      Introduction                                                                                                                     1
The novel coronavirus virus strain that arose in the Wuhan city in China in late 2019 has had a                                         2
dramatic effect on the lives of people worldwide. By 1st October, we had passed the grim milestone of                                   3
1 million deaths worldwide and over 30 million cases [1]. In the absence of disease specific treatments or                              4
prophylactic measures, most countries have adopted social distancing measures (reducing the number                                      5
of potentially risky contacts) as a means of control [2]. The optimal level of non-pharmaceutical                                       6
interventions (NPIs) requires a careful balance between public health and economic needs, from which                                    7
it could be argued that the optimal strategy is one that minimises economic disruption while still                                      8
preventing exponential growth of infection [3].                                                                                         9
In the UK, the first cases of COVID-19 were reported on 31st January 2020 in the city of York. Cases                                   10
continued to be reported sporadically throughout February and by the end of the month guidance                                         11
was issued stating that travellers from the high-risk epidemic hotspots of Hubei province in China,                                    12
Iran and South Korea should self-isolate upon arrival in the UK. By mid-March, as the number of                                        13
cases clearly began to rise, there was advice against all non-essential travel and, over the coming                                    14
days, several social-distancing measures were introduced including the closing of schools, non-essential                               15
shops, pubs and restaurants. This culminated in the introduction of a UK “lockdown”, announced on                                      16
the evening of 23rd March, whereby the public were asked to remain at home with four exceptions:                                       17
shopping for essentials; any medical emergency; for one form of exercise per day; and to travel to work                                18
if absolutely necessary. By mid-April, these stringent mitigation strategies began to have a noticeable                                19
effect, as the number of confirmed cases, hospitalisations and deaths as a result of the disease began                                 20
to decline[4, 5]. As the number of daily confirmed cases continued to decline during April, May and                                    21
into June[6], measures to ease lockdown restrictions began, with the re-opening of some non-essential                                  22
businesses and allowing small groups of individuals from different households to meet up outdoors,                                     23
whilst maintaining social distancing. This was followed by gradually re-opening primary schools in                                     24
England from 1st June and all non-essential retail outlets from 15th June.                                                             25
The dynamics throughout the summer of 2020 were characterised by the emergence of hot-spots of                                         26
persistent infection and higher than average growth rates, with such areas facing additional local                                     27
controls. Notably, Leicester and the Greater Manchester conurbation were identified as regions where                                   28
the number of identified cases per hundred thousand had increased to high levels, while the infection                                  29
in many other areas was still in decline. By mid to late August, there was some evidence that the                                      30
national underlying growth rate had become positive [6], and by the end of September exponential                                       31
growth had returned in almost all regions [7, 8]. Like many countries, the UK is now attempting to                                     32
curtail growth by introducing stricter controls, but “lockdown” is very disruptive to multiple elements                                33
of society [9, 10], especially given that restrictions are largely unpredictable to the local populous and                             34
businesses.                                                                                                                            35
One potential mechanism of regaining control is to introduce a short period of intense measures to                                     36
substantially reduce cases — this has been dubbed a ‘circuit breaker’ although “precautionary break” is                                37
a more apposite name. It is hoped that by driving infections to a sufficiently low level, other measures                               38
such as test-trace-and-isolate will have greater capacity to prevent the spread of infection [11]. In                                  39
common with other resource limited controls [12], we expect test-trace-and-isolate to be most effective                                40
when the level of infection is relatively low [13]. Additionally, a short lockdown period would limit the                              41
economic costs of such a measure.                                                                                                      42
In this paper, we consider the application of breaks to the UK, aligning a two-week period of intense                                  43
control to school half-terms in order to minimise educational disruption. We utilise both a simple                                     44
illustrative analysis and an age-structured model fitted to the UK data, to investigate the likely                                     45
impact of a break on the trajectory of infection and the subsequent numbers of hospitalised cases and                                  46
deaths.                                                                                                                                47
                                                                    2

2     Simple Analysis                                                                                                                  48
Under the simplifying assumption that without additional control measures cases will increase expo-
nentially at rate r(> 0), but during the period of the precautionary break cases will decrease at a rate
−s(< 0), we can develop a simple model for the dynamics:
                                
                                 I0 exp(rt)                                              t ≤ Tstart
                      I(t) =           I0 exp(rTstart ) exp(−s(t − Tstart )               Tstart ≤ t ≤ Tend
                                       I0 exp(rt) exp(−(r + s)(Tend − Tstart )) t ≥ Tend
                                
where Tstart and Tend define the start and end dates of the breaks. From this analysis, we observed
two key effects of a short-term lockdown. Firstly, it causes a relative reduction in the level of infection
by a factor B = 1 − exp(−(r + s)(Tend − Tstart )), compared to not having the precautionary break.
In principle, this should translate into a similar reduction in the daily number of hospitalisations and
deaths - the two epidemiological measures of most concern. We can also conceptualise this reduction
as taking the epidemic back in time to when there were fewer cases; this temporal reset, TR , is given
by:                                                                               s
                                                 TR = (Tend − Tstart ) 1 +             .
                                                                                   r
Taken together these two metrics B and TR imply that such breaks, unsurprisingly, have the greatest                                    49
impact when they are long in duration and lead to a rapid decline in cases (s large). The impact of                                    50
the uncontrolled growth rate, r, is more ambiguous. When r is large the impact of the break on the                                     51
level of infection is more pronounced as it prevents a period of high exponential growth. In contrast,                                 52
large r reduces the size of the temporal reset as it does not take many days of exponential growth to                                  53
cancel the decline expected during the break.                                                                                          54
3     Age-structured model description                                                                                                 55
We now wish to increase the realism of the modelling framework to more accurately capture the impact                                   56
of such breaks on the number of hospitalisations and deaths as a result of infection, which requires an                                57
age-structured model matched to the wealth of epidemiological data [14, 15]. Even though we have                                       58
dramatically increased the complexity of the model, the two simple metrics (B and TR ) remain of key                                   59
interest.                                                                                                                              60
The age-structured model and its matching to the UK data has been described in detail elsewhere [14,                                   61
15]. Here, for completeness, we provide a basic review of the main salient points. The model is an                                     62
ODE formulation based around SEIR-type dynamics, and incorporating five-year age classes. The                                          63
infection dynamics are modified to account for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection (dependent                                       64
on age), age-dependent susceptibility and reduced transmission from asymptomatic infections. The                                       65
model also includes additional structure to account for quarantining of identified cases and isolation                                 66
of their household.                                                                                                                    67
The model is calibrated against different sources of epidemiological data including hospitalisations,                                  68
admission to ICU, deaths, age-structured serology from blood donors and the results of pillar 2 test-                                  69
ing [15]. This matching is done separately for the seven NHS regions in England (East of England,                                      70
London, Midlands, North East & Yorkshire, North West, South East and South West) and for the                                           71
three devolved nations (Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales); although some parameters (such as                                       72
the relative transmission rate from asymptomatic infections) are universal. In particular, we highlight                                73
that the historical and changing pattern of regulations, restrictions and behaviour in each region is                                  74
captured by a weekly rescaling of the transmission matrix.                                                                             75
                                                                    3

We consider two distinct forms of simulation. In the first, we tightly constrain the dynamics (by                                       76
rescaling the transmission matrix) to have a given growth rate r from 1st September, with the growth                                    77
rate being estimated by an eigenvector approach. During the 2-week break (24th October - 7th                                            78
November) we again rescale the transmission matrix to achieved the desired rate of decay −s, before                                     79
returning to the pre-break matrix. All simulations are performed using a single parameter set.                                          80
In the second set of simulations, we allow more regional heterogeneity by fully exploring the posterior                                 81
parameter estimates. We replicate a range of NPIs by multiple rescalings of the transmission matrix,                                    82
and set the behaviour in the break to coincide with regional estimates of transmission at the height                                    83

Fig. 1: Impact of a 2-week precautionary break during half-term on the infection dynamics. For
a range of assumed growth rates in September and October, we illustrate both the reduction in infection (B)
and the temporal reset (TR ) of a break starting on 24th October. Each line corresponds to a different strength
of control during the two week break, which is linked to observed epidemic declines.
To illustrate the simple analytical behaviour in more detail, we pick a definitive case (Figure 1): a two-                              86
week break from 24th October -7th November to coincide with school half-terms (thereby minimising                                       87
educational disruption). We consider the relative reduction B and the temporal reset TR across a                                        88
range of positive growth rates r, from 0.01 to 0.22, corresponding to the upper bound of the growth                                     89
in the March. We consider five different intensities of break (s = 0, 0.02, 0.045, 0.06 and 0.1) with the                               90
first four aligning with different periods of control in the UK (August, June, May, April), and the                                     91
latter corresponding to the observed decline in continental Europe where the lockdown restrictions                                      92
were more intense. We find that, as shown earlier analytically, the greatest effects are found for                                      93
stricter controls during the precautionary break; lower intrinsic growth (r) outside of the break leads                                 94
to a longer temporal reset, whereas a higher growth rate is associated with a bigger relative decline in                                95
infection.                                                                                                                              96
For the age-structured model, we initially focus on the temporal dynamics over the period from August                                   97
to the end of the year (Figure 2). We chose four rates of decline during the break corresponding to                                     98
different rates observed in the UK under different lockdown measures (using the same colours as in                                      99
Figure 1). For comparison we also show the dynamics without a 2-week break, but including the                                          100
standard 1-week half term break for school children (black dashed line). We contrast the behaviour at                                  101
four different intrinsic growth rates for the period 1st September to 24th October (r ≈ 0.02, r ≈ 0.03,                                102
r ≈ 0.05 and r ≈ 0.07, columns of Figure 2). Given the extra realism of the age-structured model, we                                   103
project not just the number of infections (top row), but the number of daily hospitalisations and deaths                               104
(middle and bottom row respectively). We also give the total number of infections, hospitalisations                                    105
and deaths between 1st October and 1st January as numerical values.                                                                    106

These results reflect the findings from the simple analytical framework, but provide greater clarity on                                107
the impact of these breaks on the key epidemiological quantities of hospitalisations and deaths. Both                                  108
of these lag behind the changes in infection, and the drop in both quantities after the half-term break                                109
is far smoother than is observed for infection. For all three measures, it is clear that the temporal reset                            110
increases with the strength of controls during the break, but decreases with the growth rate; the reset                                111
is also longer and more clearly defined for infection than for the lagged measures of hospitalisations                                 112
and deaths. Looking at the medium term impact of the break (as measured by the total number of                                         113
deaths between 1st October and 1st January), we observe that for low growth rates the strongest levels                                 114
of NPI during the break reduces deaths by approximately 29%. In contrast, when the growth is high                                      115
the reduction is approximately 49%.                                                                                                    116

cline. To consider the potential dynamics in more detail we chose 1000 samples from the posterior                                      118
distribution [15], for each region of the UK, and vary the level of NPIs to achieve a range of growth                                  119
rates (r). A two-week break is enacted on 24th October, with the rate of decline (−s) determined                                       120
by the maximal level of NPI over the full epidemic to date (as estimated in the posterior parameter                                    121
distribution); hence introducing far more variability into the process. We again looked at the temporal                                122
reset (TR ) defined as the time difference between the end of the break and the previous time when a                                   123
similar level of infection occurred.                                                                                                   124
The results of these replicates that include natural parameter and control uncertainty show remarkable                                 125
agreement with the simple analysis (depicted by the red line, Figure 3a). The exception is for the                                     126
very highest levels of considered growth rates (r > 0.07); allowing this level of increase since early                                 127
September leads to depletion of the susceptible population, which brings a greater temporal reset than                                 128
expected. However, allowing a growth rate of r > 0.07 (a doubling time of less than 10 days) for a                                     129
long period is not a viable public health option. We find a similar pattern when examining the relative                                130
reduction in deaths; in keeping with simple theory there is a rise in the reduction that can be obtained                               131
as the growth rate increases, but this again suffers from the non-linear effects of susceptible depletion                              132
above r = 0.07.                                                                                                                        133

captured the time gained by the break; the red line is the theoretical result from the simple theoretical model
based on the average rate of decline during the break across all replicates. (b) shows the relative reduction in

5     Discussion                                                                                                                       134
The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, and the number of severe cases of COVID-19 worldwide, has necessi-                                         135
tated the adoption of a range of control measures in different countries. In the absence of a vaccine or                               136
other medical approaches, control has had to rely on very disruptive non-pharmaceutical interventions.                                 137
In the UK, the implementation of such NPIs during the lockdown period (23rd March - 13th May)                                          138
reversed the nationally increasing hospitalisations and deaths (r ≈ 0.2) and led to a steady decline                                   139
(r ≈ −0.05) [4, 5]. The gradual relaxing of NPIs has generated a slowly increasing growth rate, which                                  140
we estimate became positive again (leading to exponential growth) in mid-August [7]. Against this                                      141
backdrop of rising cases, we have investigated the benefits of a planned 2-week precautionary break                                    142
(or ’circuit-break’), where strict rules are reapplied in an attempt to drive down cases before their                                  143

imposition becomes necessary to prevent health system overload. Such breaks are not in themselves                                      144
long-term solutions, but may allow other methods that work best with low numbers of cases (such as                                     145
test-trace-and-isolate) to reassert control and they may be more sustainable than other NPI imposition                                 146
approaches.                                                                                                                            147
Both simple analytical approaches and an age-structured model fit to a range of UK data show that                                      148
planned precautionary break could be highly effective short-term control measures. Compared to an                                      149
absence of such controls, precautionary breaks generate a reduction in infection, hospitalisations and                                 150
deaths, which is most pronounced when the growth rate is moderately high (doubling time of more                                        151
than 10 days). This reduction in infection can be interpreted as a temporal reset, taking the level                                    152
of infection back (in time) to a lower value, allowing greater opportunity for additional public health                                153
measures to be enacted or take effect.                                                                                                 154
Unsurprisingly, breaks that generate the most stringent application of NPIs are associated with the                                    155
greatest immediate rates of declines and, as a consequence, the greatest public health benefits. There-                                156
fore, the success of any action is highly contingent on the adherence of the populous to the recommen-                                 157
dations and rules; a break is only effective if there is an average increase in level of social distancing                             158
across the country. We also consistently find that the optimal time for a break is always now; there                                   159
are no good epidemiological reasons to delay the break as this will simply push back any benefits                                      160
until later, leaving more time for additional cases to accumulate. We have focused on combining the                                    161
break with the school half-term holiday in October, but the same logic would apply to the Christmas                                    162
holidays (perhaps extending them for a week into 2021) or to the spring half-term.                                                     163
Ultimately, such short-term precautionary breaks will only be effective if (i) their planned nature helps                              164
to minimise the associated societal harms and economic losses, (ii) there is good compliance with the                                  165
measures across all regions and sections of society, and (iii) the reduction in cases is used to regain                                166
control and bring the growth rate back below zero.                                                                                     167
