              The Revelation of Novel Mutations in Human Luteinizing Hormone Beta Subunit
                           Related to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome among Sudanese Women
              Nidal Essa, Suliman Osman, Salah Jemaah, Mohamed A. Hassan, Rashid Eltayeb.
         Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (POCS) is a mystery disorder with mysterious
         multiple players characterized by their mystic effects on disease pathophysiology
         resulting in various phenotypic pictures among the PCOS population. The Luteinizing
         hormone beta subunit (LH-B) (protein ID P01229) is a gonadotropin hormone secreted
         from the anterior pituitary belongs to the glycoprotein family, mapped on (chr19p13.3)
         and consists of three exons. It has a central role in promoting ovulation via stimulation of
         ovarian steroidogenesis.
         Objectives: This is a prospective laboratory- based cross-sectional study to determine
         genetic mutations associate with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) among (30)
         Sudanese families ((cases n=35 families, 90 females and (controls n= 11 families, 30
         females) in Khartoum State, Sudan.
         Methods: Quantitative Enzyme- Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA), enzymatic
         methods and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) used to analyze both the biochemical
         parameters and polymorphism detection followed by Sanger sequencing for genotyping
         in addition to bioinformatics software for protein structure and function.
         Results: All the biochemical parameters levels of (FBG, LH, Testosterone, Insulin and
         lipid profile) elevated from the control group were statistically significant except for the
         serum FSH (cases=5.4±4.6, controls=5.3±2.8) and PRL ((cases=12.4±8.2,
         controls=8.0±6.1)) which were statistically insignificant p=0.94 and p=0.06. After Sanger
         sequencing; (5) single nucleotide polymorphisms ((rs5030775, A18T), rs746167425,
         R22K), (rs1800447, W28R), (rs35270001, H30R) and (rs34349826, I35T)) located on
         (exon 2) of LHβ gene were statistically significant with serum LH, Testosterone and
         insulin levels among PCOS families.
         Conclusion: This is the first molecular identification of a family- based study in Sudan
         exploring the genetic of LHB gene and interrelated its serum level with PCOS
         manifestation. The revelation of these mutations will give a clue to the genetic
         inheritance mode links and might explain the abnormal poor response of controlled
         ovarian stimulation tests in some PCOS women.

         Introduction:
         Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder that associated with abundant ovarian
         cysts combined with hormone imbalance and different metabolic disorders.1,2 We have
         to admit that PCOS is a disease of contradictory even on his name which has been
         proposed to renamed completely to a magical name that reflects its complex
         interchangeable background as an epigenetic as well as metabolic disorder and bring
         the three common diagnostic criteria (1990 National Institutes of Health’s (NIH), the
         Rotterdam criteria and the Androgen Excess Society) to a one diagnostic platform that
         fit and cover all phenotypic features of PCOS which could plays a role in reducing
         the prevalence of PCOS (1.6-18%) among women within the reproductive age.2-4
         Notably, various immuno-assay methods which lack their sensitivity and specificity on
         determine the accurate results of hormone profile increase the complexity of diagnosing
         PCOS, therefore, high-quality techniques such as liquid chromatography tandem mass
         spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) will be preferable to support the accuracy of diagnostic
         biochemical           parameters.          Consequently,        a    better     understanding          of    disease
         pathophysiology with consentient diagnostic criteria will contribute on developing
         intellectual community towards PCOS on different levels; PCOS patients who will be
         more peaceful with disease complications such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM),
         cardiovascular disorders, and even fertility problems. In addition to increase family
         awareness          towards          its  genetic      background       and      perspective        fertility   plans
         which consequently result                   in a      community         with a        low         prevalence        of
         obesity, dyslipidemia, and infertility.5, 6
         In general, binding of GnRH to his GPCR on the gonadotropic cell actives the Gαq/11
         protein which activate phospholipase Cb, followed by subsequent activation of second
         messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP3)                     and diacylglycerol (DAG),               via     cleavage
         of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate. Both IP3 and DAG mobilize intracellular
         calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum stores, which is essential for beta subunit
         expression of both LH and FSH. Regarding the ovarian theca cells, LH binds to
         LHCGR to stimulate androgen synthesis during the follicular phase, stimulate ovulation
         and production of progesterone from corpus luteum. Steroidogenesis begins with the
         movement of mitochondrial cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where

         the cytochrome P450-associated enzyme removes the side chain of cholesterol,
         producing pregnenolone. 7 Thus excessive theca cell androgen secretion lead to vary of
         hormonal and metabolic abnormalities such as hirsutism, anovulation, clinical and/or
         biochemical hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance (IR), and obesity
         which are more common signs among PCOS population.5, 8
         Moreover, the natural origin of PCOS might switch on during fetal life because of
         abnormal           developmental             programming          associated        with       the   presence         of
         excess glucocorticoids and/or androgens from their mothers which results on dynamic
         changes in gene expression, resulting hyperinsulinemia, adipocyte dysfunction
         and childhood visceral obesity, and PCOS.9, 10 Additionally, various familial aggregation
         studies suggested that PCOS is an autosomal dominant syndrome and both sisters
         and brothers of PCOS women might be associated with infertility problems.
         Recent         genome-wide             association        studies    (GWAS)           in Han Chinese ladies with
         PCOS incontestable eleven genetic                     loci    that related     to PCOS that are         accountable

         regulation, internal secretion action and secretion, energy physiological state, chronic
         inflammation, and others.11-16
         The recent study focused on LHB gene to determine the relation between single
         nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the LHB gene and the clinical features of PCOS
         among Sudanese women within the reproductive age.
         2. Methodology:
         This is a prospective laboratory based cross-sectional study carried out in different
         fertility centers as well as different localities (families’ homes) in Khartoum State
         which approved by the Ethical committee - Federal Ministry of Health (3-12-19).
         According to the inclusion Criteria: the target population of this study is families (n=90,
         35 families) whom have one or two sisters diagnosed as PCOS patients within the
         reproductive age (20-40) years (according to 2003 Rotterdam criteria). Matching
         criteria for control group selection was putted in consideration with the special
         circumstances of the study (n=30 11 families). Any Sudanese ladies below the
         reproductive           age,        females       with      family    history       of      adrenal   hyperplasia,

         4. Discussion:
         In this recent study different biochemical parameters were investigated associated with
         LHB gene among (25) Sudanese families who had one or more females with PCOS and
         (11) families as control group. This performed study revealed that the prevalence of
         menstrual irregularity is (46.8%) irregular menstrual cycle with (54.5%) and (42.9%)
         had acne and facial hirsutism respectively. More than (70%) of this present study group
         had increased BMI (30) or higher while (23.4%) were lean and all the biochemical
         parameters were within the normal range but above the control group of the study
         except serum HDL, similar to (Shoaib et al., 2015) and disagree with (Sadeghi et al.,
         2014). Reports from multicenter study with (1466) subjects, of whom (363) had PCOS
         and (79) polycystic ovaries (PCO) without other symptoms of PCOS associated the
         homozygotes with recurrent spontaneous abortions, menstrual irregularities with
         infertility, and PCOS and elevation of testosterone, whereas the Finnish subjects whom
         were homo- or heterozygous for the polymorphic LHB allele were largely healthy. In
         contrast to the first report of this mutation among male population showed a male
         patient with HH and provided clinical and experimental evidence, confirming that this
         novel mutation causes selective LH deficiency whereas other results showed
         significantly higher serum level of LH in V-LH carriers among the young Baltic men
         and Estonian male infertility patients. Also, it is observed that sisters of affected women
         have irregular menstrual cycles which agreed with the Turkish study showed that sisters
         were having menstrual irregularity and larger ovaries with higher serum
         androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels than sisters without PCO,
         suggesting a spectrum of clinical phenotypes in PCO families.24-30
         More than (70%) of this present study population had increased BMI (30) or higher
         with increased level of serum insulin which is responsible for the central adiposity and
         on the other hand the findings of the present study were in agreement with (Patel, 2018)
         31
            .
         This recent up to date performed study highlighted the metabolic relationship between
         the occurrence of genetic mutations on exon 2 of LHB and its association with PCOS,

         moreover, the present results exposed that the presence of (5) single nucleotide
         polymorphisms of LHB gene, that shared between the investigated cases were with
         homozygous (AA) inheritance mode, located on the signal peptide and the homologue
         glycoprotein parts could have significant influence on serum level of the hormone but
         not inactivating or damaging its biological function. The most reported mutations of
         this research findings were (rs1800447 (W28R) and rs34349826 (I35T)) which
         associated with protein glycosylation, controlled ovarian stimulation, male infertility
         and PCOS, while rs5030775 (A18T) associated with more potent in stimulating IP3
         response than wild type LH. 32-34 No literature found regarding to rs746167425 (R22K)
         and rs35270001 (H30R) but in regards to their physiochemical properties; Arginine
         mutated into a Lysine at position 22 which is smaller but not affecting protein stability.
         Whereas Histidine located very close to a residue that makes a cysteine bond and
         supposed to form hydrogen bond with Tryptophan on position 28 mutated to Arginine
         with positive charge and small in size. Interestingly, this newly positive charge is
         already mutated on the present cases to Arginine that created an extra glycosylation on
         the mutated type and might cause loss of hydrophobic interactions with other molecules
         on the surface of the protein 30.
         Signal peptides is a short peptides located in the N-terminal of gene-proteins,
         responsible for protein recognition, secretion, and often cleaved to generate the mature
                      31
         protein         . Therefore, presence of rs5030775 mutation (A18T) within the leader
         sequence that has been reported as potential stimulator of IP3 more than cAMP
         pathway could emphasis that alteration of GnRH pulse due to overstimulation
         of IP3 which in turn increase LHb gene expression and might influence abnormal
         recognition of the prohormone within the endoplasmic reticulum when binding with
         SRP and           thus        affect      its      interaction     with LHCGR in              contrast     to point
         mutation associated                                                  with autosomal recessive familial
         isolated hypoparathyroidism caused due to improper cleavage by signal peptidase at the
         normal position33. Remarkably, this mutation ((historically reported as Thr-3A) A18T)
         was also found in 3 (3/100) Rwanda population with heterogeneous pattern might be a
         sign of evolutionarily background of PCOS origin despite the difference on their
         inheritance mode                        and support the idea that high level of serum LHB associated

         with increased                               pulse frequencies because high GnRH pulse frequencies
         favor LHb gene expression whereas low GnRH pulse frequencies favor FSHb gene
         expression34-36.
         Protein        glycosylation           is    one     of    the   most      frequent        and     relevant    post-
         translational modifications and plays a key role in the modulation of protein properties
         and function mainly on the half- life of the hormone and heterodimer stability
         and in the intrinsic bioactivity. The carbohydrate content of LH is approximately 15%
         (N50), that of FSH 20% (N25, N42), and that of hCG 30% (N33, N50) and the
         circulatory half-lives of the gonadotropins are about (20 mins) for LH,                                 (2 hrs.) for
         FSH, and (12–24 hrs.) for hCG. Molecular alterations of V-LHB, due to rs1800447
         (Trp28Arg) and Ile35Thr (rs34349826) create an extra glycosylation signal (Asn-X-
         Thr) into the LHB chain, which introduces an oligosaccharide side chain into Asn13,
         similar to that present in HCG, which might increase the affinity binding between the
         peptide portion of the hormone and the receptor and also increase the life span of the
         hormone           (Shafaghi           et     al.,    2019).      Findings       on        serum      samples        of
         variant homozygotes showed that V-LH is more active than WT-LH in bioassays in
         vitro, but it has a shorter half-life in circulation. The shorter half-life of V-LH is
         possibly compensated for by about (40%) higher promoter activity of the gene,
         explained         by (8) SNPs in                 the (50-flanking regions) of V-LHB.                     They were
         reported as modulatory effect                   on hyperandrogenemia phenotype                  of PCOS.       More
         recently, Alviggi et al. have confirmed that v-LHβ polymorphism produces a less active
         form of the hormone which is not able to support satisfactorily FSH activity during
         controlled ovarian stimulation, and that the v-LHβ carriers experience a considerable
         decrease of the number of transferred embryos, thereby highlighting the essential role
         of LH/FSH cooperation in the latest stages of follicle maturation.
         In conclusion, giving a patient the diagnosis of PCOS makes the patient aware of
         possible fertility concerns, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and theoretical
         increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Since PCOS could be genetic, it may bring
         awareness to family members and future children. Given that insulin resistance is
         heavily associated with PCOS, these individuals require increased screening and will
         likely have better long-term outcomes with early lifestyle interventions, as well as
