Key points
     •   Currently limited information available on the complex interaction between epidemiology, media
         attention, pandemic control measures, risk perception and compliance with public health measures.
     •   Despite the relatively high risk perception of a possible infection with COVID-19, we observed a steady
         decrease in adherence to public health measures.
     •   Throughout the study, information-seeking behaviour shifted.
     •   We observed a decrease in acceptance among the participants in regards to avoiding physical contact.

Abstract
The COVID-19 monitoring behavioural insights study was conducted from April-May 2020 in Finland.
Respondents reported feeling confident protecting themselves against COVID-19 infection. Worries shifted from
overloading the health system (mean value 5.5 [95% CI: 5.4-5.6]) to mental health concerns (mean value 5.3
[95% CI 5.2-5.4]). Maintaining physical distancing from families and friends decreased by 7% and 6%.
Respondents mostly agreed that if a vaccine would become available, they would get it. The decrease in
acceptance of recommended measures needs further analysis, but current results provide evidence to support the
response.

Introduction
Previous studies have demonstrated that traditional media, social media and public health communication can
influence knowledge, behaviour and perception of public health issues1-2 and influence preparedness and
protective behaviour .3-4Communication strategies should follow best practices for public health and risk
communication and tailor messages accordingly, to address risk perceptions, attitudes toward risk avoidance,
fears, worries and trust in authority5, and provide evidence-informed responses to misinformation, to support
rational, adaptive and protective behaviours6. In April 2020, the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL)
initiated regular monitoring of the Finnish population’s behaviour, knowledge, perception and trust regarding
novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). From April 7, 2020, we monitored these variables bi-weekly and shared
findings with decision makers to help identify appropriate response measures, policies, interventions and
communication strategies.
Methods
We used the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO Standard): Monitoring knowledge, risk perceptions,
preventive behaviours, and public trust in the current coronavirus outbreak - WHO standard protocol7-8 to design
a brief (approximately 10 minutes) online survey. Three iterative randomly-selected panels of approximately
1000 participants, representative of Finnish population in terms of age groups, gender and place of residence
were invited to respond to items assessing risk perceptions, worries, fears, trust and information-seeking
behaviour. We assessed risk perception as the perceived probability of contracting COVID-19, personal
susceptibility and the expected severity of the disease using a 7 point Likert scale, from low to high, for which
we calculated a mean value and 95% confidence intervals. Other question items addressed worries, trust in
authorities, information-seeking and protective behaviours. Physical distancing behaviour was evaluated using
closed questions with three possible responses: already done, planned or not planned at all. We used a 7 point
Likert scale ranging from 1(disagree) to 7 (agree) to assess attitude towards a potential vaccine by asking
participants how likely they would be to get vaccinated if a potential vaccine became available and

recommended by Public Health authorities. We present preliminary findings of the first three rounds of data
collection (Figure), 7-9 April (n= 1009), 24-28 April (n= 1032) and 8-11 May (n=1060).
Results
Risk perception, behaviour and trust
Respondents’ perception of their susceptibility to contracting COVID-19 was highest at the second time point,
with a mean value of 3.8 (95% CI: 3.7- 2.8). In the third round, perceived probability of contracting the disease
and its perceived severity decreased to a mean of 3.4 (95% CI: 3.3-3.5) and 4.3 (95% CI: 4.2- 4.4), respectively.
Overall, respondents in the third round felt confident they could protect themselves against infection (mean value
of 6 [95% CI: 5.92-6.05]).
At the first time point, 86% (864/1009) of participants had reduced their physical contacts with their families
after the announcement of physical distancing recommendation on 12 March 2020. During the last round, 79%
(835/1060) reported following this recommendation. Avoiding unnecessary social contact during the first time-
point was reported by 86% (868/1009) compared to 80% (853/1060), at the third time-point.
Trust was evaluated using a 7 point scale from “very little trust” to “a great deal of trust”. Respondents in the
third round scored a mean value of 4.7 (95% CI: 4.6-4.8) for the Ministry of Health, 4.9 (95% CI: 4.8- 5) for
THL and 4.7 (95% CI: 4.6-4.8) towards the government. Trust levels in different medias remained constant
through the period, identifying television and online/ print news as the most trusted outlets, with mean values at
the last time point of 5.0 (95% CI: 4.9-5.1) and 4.9 (95% CI: 4.8-5), compared to podcasts (mean value: 2.8
[95% CI: 2.7-2.9]) and social media (mean value: 2.7 [95% CI: 2.6-2.8]). A low level of trust in blogs was also
evidenced with a mean value of 2.6 (95% CI: 2.4-2.7) at the last follow up.
Worries
Throughout the whole study period, the coronavirus situation continued to worry and frighten Finnish
respondents, but this appeared to be decreasing. In the first survey round, the leading worries were related to

overloading of the health system (mean value 5.5 [95% CI: 5.4-5.6]), the situation of small companies (mean
value 5.5 [95% CI: 5.4-5.6]) and economic recession (mean value 5.4 [95% CI: 5.3-5.5]), while during the third
round, economic recession was the leading worry (mean value 5.3 [95% CI: 5.2-5.4]), followed by increased
mental health concerns (mean value 5.3 [95% CI 5.2-5.4]) and the situation of small companies (mean value 5.3
[95% CI: 5.1-5.3]). Worries related to oneself (mean value 4 [95% CI: 3.9-4.1]) or of a loved person (mean value
4.7 [95% CI: 4.6- 4.8]) becoming infected were reported throughout the study period, but were not identified as
the most important concerns.
Acquisition of information and attitude towards the media
In the first round, participants reported searching COVID-19 related information often, with 40% (403/1009)
declaring searching information multiple times a day, compared to 20% (214/1060) in the third round. Treatment
progress development remained of interest during the whole study, with an increased interest in vaccine
development during the third survey (mean value: 5.2 [95% CI: 5.1-5.3]) and a majority of respondents reporting
willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 when opportunity arises (mean value 5.4 [95% CI: 5.3- 5.5]).
Gender differences
We assessed differences between male and female respondents, in terms of risk perception, worries, trust and
information seeking patterns. Throughout the whole study period, women responded perceiving themselves to be
more susceptible to contracting the infection, more confident in being able to protect themselves from infection,
and more likely to avoid unnecessary physical contact (Supplementary material). A difference was observed in
the leading worries, with males reporting lower levels of worry about overloading the health system, increasing
mental health concerns, or infection of a person close to them during the whole time period. Measures of trust in
different institutions over the two month period revealed that women were more trusting of the Ministry of
Social Affairs and Health and the government.
Attitude towards a potential vaccine remained stable at all rounds. On a scale from 1(disagree) to 7(agree), mean
value of how likely participants would get immunisation increased from 5.3 [95% CI: 5.2-5.4] to 5.4 [95% CI:

5.3-5.5] between the first and third survey round. Overall, most participants were in favor of receiving
immunisation (69%, n=2141), 26% (n=809) mildly disagreed or had no opinion while 5% (n=151) strongly
disagreed with benefiting from immunisation. There was no statistical difference regarding likelihood of
receiving the vaccine between genders, however, age significantly influenced likelihood of receiving
immunisation: the older respondents were, the most likely they were to get immunisation provided a vaccine
would be available. This difference was evidenced at all time points. During the third wave, mean likelihood of
getting immunisation ranged from 4.7[95% CI: 4.7-5.0] among 18-29 years old respondents to 6.1 [5.9-6.2] in
respondents aged 65 years old or more.
Discussion
This study provides evidence for decision makers and communication activities by assessing risk perceptions,
worries, fears, trust in authority and information-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 epidemic, and
describing changing attitudes over time, as the public health crisis develops. Currently, there is limited
information available on the complex interaction between epidemiology, media attention, pandemic control
measures, risk perception and compliance with public health measures.9-10Despite the relatively high risk
perception of a possible infection with COVID-19, a steady decrease in adherence to public health measures was
reported. Most respondents believed they are not highly susceptible to COVID-19, and if contracted, the disease
would not be severe. Trust remained stable over the study period with worries expressed in different areas.
Surprisingly, own infection or infection of a loved one did not seem to be the greatest concern; rather, fears and
worries were consistently related to economic recession, increase in mental health concerns and the situation of
small businesses. Across the whole study, information-seeking behaviour shifted from searching information
multiple times a day to several times a week. Measures such as avoiding physical contact with friends and
family seem to be losing acceptance among the participants, indicating that such measures are becoming more
difficult to sustain.
Overall attitude towards a potential vaccine was favorable, with older respondents more inclined to receive
immunisation when it would become available.

As the COVID-19 epidemic evolves, it is important to understand the dynamics of risk perceptions, fears,
misinformation and protective behaviours, identify which protective measures are employed, and what
information is lacking. Based on continuing data collection and analysis, this tool makes it possible for
authorities to react quickly to emerging misinformation or sudden increases in risk perceptions that could foment
panic.
