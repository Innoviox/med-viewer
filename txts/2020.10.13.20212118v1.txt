  Abstract
  Introduction: COVID-19 outbreak has imposed an eight-week confinement in France. During
  this period, children and their families were exposed to a full-time home life. The aim of this
  study was to assess the emotional experience and tolerance of children with autism spectrum
  disorder (ASD) in this particular context.
  Method: A clinical survey was proposed to parents and rated by professionals once a week
  during the quarantine period in France. 95 autistic children followed by the child and
  adolescent psychiatry department of Tours university hospital were assessed from the 18th of
  March to the 8th of May. The following clinical points were investigated: child anxiety,
  family anxiety, behavior problems, impact on sleep, impact on appetite, impact on school
  work, family tension, confinement intolerance, difficulties to follow a schedule, isolation
  behavior.
  Results: Despite minor changes in family anxiety and school work, no difference was
  highlighted between clinical scores collected at the beginning and at the end of this period.
  ASD children with or without intellectual disability had non-significant clinical changes
  during quarantine. This evolution was also independent of the accommodation type (house or
  apartment) and the parental status (relationship, separated or isolated).
  Conclusion: The sameness dimension in autism and parents’ adaptation may be involved in
  this clinical stability during COVID confinement. Moreover, specialized tools and support
  provided by professionals could have participated to these outcomes and must be regularly
  promoted in order to help families in this still difficult period.

  Introduction
  COVID-19 outbreak began in China at the end of 2019 and quickly spread to Europe. In
  France, the confinement of the population began on the 17th of March and schools closed the
  day before. This new situation, which lasted officially until the 11 th of May, exposed children
  and parents to a full-time home life. We know that this lifestyle can be difficult for families,
  especially for children suffering from mental diseases [1]. The psychological impact of
  quarantine is heterogeneous and can be long lasting, including anxiety, depression symptoms
  and feelings of anger and fear. To limit these consequences, it is recommended to reduce
  boredom and improve communication [2]. In order to help parents at home, some advice was
  published to manage children suffering from autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [3].
  Furthermore, health professionals regularly contacted families to get news and to provide
  some personal advice. Considering these clinical resources, we investigated how well the
  COVID-19 quarantine was tolerated by autistic children who benefit from regular rehab
  programs in the child and adolescent psychiatry department of Tours university hospital.
  Material and methods
  A telephone survey was proposed to families, once a week, during French lockdown. The
  following clinical points were investigated by health professionals (doctors, nurses and
  psychologists): child anxiety, family anxiety, behavior problems, impact on sleep, impact on
  appetite, impact on school work, family tension, confinement intolerance, difficulties to
  follow a schedule, isolation behavior. Each of these ten clinical items was rated on a 5-point
  scale in reference to the basal clinical state of the child: 1/not at all, 2/a little, 3/moderately,
  4/a lot or 5/enormously. The mean of the completed clinical items, labelled emotional score,
  was computed. Two time points were considered: the 3 first weeks (T1) and the 3 last weeks
                                                                                                                                3

  of the recruitment period (T2). Furthermore, the accommodation type (apartment or house)
  and the parental status were also collected.
  Additionally, parents were regularly contacted by professionals and many supporting
  materials were sent to families (sensorimotor activities, timetables, simplified COVID
  explanations) during this period.
  SphinxOnline v 4.16 was used for data collection. Student t-test and linear mixed-effect
  models with repeated measures (patients as random effect; time and ID, accommodation type
  or parental status as fixed effects) were carried out to study the effect of the quarantine
  between T1 and T2 time points.
  Approval of Tours hospital ethical committee has been granted to conduct this project.
  Results
  95 children with ASD, aged from 2 to 16 years old, were recruited from the 18th of March to
  the 8th of May in the child and adolescent psychiatry department of Tours university hospital

  Eight clinical items (child anxiety, behavior problems, impact on sleep, impact on appetite,
  family tension, confinement intolerance, difficulties to follow a schedule, isolation behavior)
  had an average score of less than 2 and two items (family anxiety and impact on school work)
  were greater than 2 at both T1 and T2 time points (Fig.1).
  The emotional score (N=95) was 1.82 (SD: 0.59) at T1 and 1.78 (SD: 0.59) at T2, no
  statistical difference was observed (t(188)=0.44, p=0.66)). Moreover there was no DI effect
  (DI effect: p=0.54, interaction DI * time: p=0.83), no accommodation type effect
  (accommodation type effect: p=0.12, interaction accommodation type * time: p=0.61), and no
  parental status effect (parental status effect: p=0.88, interaction parental status * time:
  p=0.93).
  Discussion
  No difference was highlighted between clinical scores collected at the beginning and at the
  end of French COVID confinement in our sample. Despite minor changes in family anxiety
  and impact on school work, the emotional score was unchanged. This evolution was not found
  by Colizzi et al. (2020), who highlight more frequent and intense behavior problems during
  confinement [4]. However, unlike Colizzi’s study, our investigation was a prospective survey
  and included children followed by professionals. The latter regularly contacted families and
  offered adapted and personalized tools during quarantine. Indeed, we argue that the materials
  sent and regular support provided by professionals prevented an increase of anxiety and
  behavioral disturbances. Our outcomes may also be linked to autism’s sameness dimension
  [5], associated to the tendency to seek immutability and to be afraid of changes [6].
  Furthermore, the decrease of social interactions and sensory exterior inputs during the
  confinement could have helped to maintain environmental stability.

  Another result of our survey was the minor changes in family anxiety and school work.
  During quarantine, parents had to ensure their children’s schooling in addition to their work.
  This double task was complicated, especially since the education of autistic children presents
  several particularities and needs specific materials [7]. Moreover, Lei et al. (2020) described
  an increased prevalence of anxiety and depression in adults affected by quarantine [8], which
  could have participated to our parents’ distress.
  Furthermore, we found that the accommodation type and parental status did not influence the
  emotional experience and tolerance of children to quarantine. These independent factors can
  highlight the significance of routine and environmental stability. On the other hand, autistic
  children were allowed to go out longer (> 1 hour per day) than other children from the 2nd of
  April (from the mid-time of quarantine); this political decision could have impacted the effect
  of these variables.
  Finally, our survey has some limits. Firstly, clinical points were evaluated by parents and
  rated by professionals who know the children: this method does not ensure the uniformity of
  measurements. Secondly, our study was based on children followed by a single center with
  specific procedures which limits generalization to other situations.
  Conclusion
  This prospective study underlines the unchanged emotional experience and behavior in ASD
  children during quarantine in France. ASD particularities and parents’ adjustments to the
  situation probably contributed to this clinical stability; moreover, professionals’ support and
  specialized tools likely participated to these results as well and must be promoted in order to
  help families in this still difficult period. Finally, going back to school and the resumption of
                                                                                                                                6
