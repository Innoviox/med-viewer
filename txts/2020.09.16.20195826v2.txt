2 DISEASE MODEL
A common way of modeling the spread of infectious diseases is
using the SIR (susceptible-infectious-recovered) model [49], which
is a compartmental model that divides the entire population into
three classes. The susceptible state consists of individuals who may
become infected; the infectious individuals are those currently af-
flicted with the disease; and recovered individuals are ones who
have overcome the disease.
    An extension of this is the SEIR model [49] that also allows for      Figure 1: Modified SEIR model for COVID-19, with multiple
an exposed state where an individual has received a load of the           infectious states.
pathogen, but is not yet infectious or symptomatic. In the SEIR
model it is generally assumed that recovered individuals have life-
long immunity.
    Both the SIR and SEIR models are generally based on differential      2.2 State Transitions
equations, and allow for various types of qualitative analyses [14,       The state transitions between different states for an individual are
46].                                                                      also as indicated in Figure 1.These are as follows.

3 AGENT MODEL
In this section, we describe our agent model and its workings.
In Section 3.1, we first encapsulate the difference between black-
box and glass-box views of the spread of COVID-19, which is so
important to understanding why this pandemic has proven so hard
to tackle. Section 3.2 describes the primary characteristics of the
agents as well as the system in which they are placed. Section 3.3
describes the state transitions of agents.
                                                                                   (a) Black-box view.                    (b) Glass-box view.

In terms of modeling the occurrence of COVID-19 or any similar
disease in a population, we find it useful to bring in the distinction
between black-box and glass-box views of the epidemic.
