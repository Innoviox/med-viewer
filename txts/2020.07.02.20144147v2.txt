15    Abstract
16    Background: Patients treated in hand surgery (HS) belong to different demographic groups and
17    have varying impairments related to different pathologies. HS outcomes are measured to assess
18    treatment results, complication risks and intervention reliability. A one-dimensional and linear
19    measure would allow for unbiased comparisons of manual ability between patients and different
20    treatment effects.
21    Objective: To adapt the ABILHAND questionnaire through Rasch analysis for specific use in HS
22    patients and to examine its validity.
23    Methods: A preliminary 90-item questionnaire was presented to 216 patients representing the
24    diagnoses most frequently encountered in HS, including distal radius fracture (n=74), basal thumb
25    arthritis (n=66), carpal tunnel syndrome (n=53), and heavy wrist surgery (n=23). Patients were
26    assessed during the early recovery and in the late follow-up period (0-3 months, 3-6 months and
27    >6 months), leading to a total of 305 assessments. They rated their perceived difficulty with
28    queried activities as impossible, difficult, or easy. Responses were analyzed using the RUMM2030
29    software. Items were refined based on item-patient targeting, fit statistics, differential item
30    functioning, local independence and item redundancy. Patients also completed the QuickDASH,
31    12-item Short Form Survey (SF-12) and a numerical pain scale.
32    Results: The rating scale Rasch model was used to select 23 mostly bimanual items on a 3-level
33    scale, which constitute a unidimensional, linear measure of manual ability with good reliability
34    across all included diagnostic groups (Person-Separation Index = 0.90). The resulting scale was
35    found to be invariant across demographic and clinical subgroups and over time. ABILHAND-HS

39    Conclusion: ABILHAND-HS is a robust person-centered measure of manual ability in HS patients.

40    Introduction
41    In hand surgery (HS), as in other medical specialties, outcome evaluations are needed to assess
42    the effectiveness and reliability of the intervention, as well as to reinforce patient education
43    regarding the risks and outcomes of the procedure and, potentially, to justify therapeutic
44    practices to payers [1]. Physician-documented reports of HS outcomes based on clinical
45    examination and imaging should be complemented with patient reported outcomes assessed by
46    questionnaires designed to capture patients’ perspectives with respect to the impact of their
47    conditions and interventions on their daily lives [2–4].
48    Current views of health and disability have been shaped by the World Health Organization's
49    International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health [5], which parses disease
50    consequences into three domains: impairment of anatomical structures (e.g. bones, muscles,
51    ligaments) or body functions (e.g. motor skills, sensitivity), activity limitations (e.g. manual
52    activities), and participation restrictions (e.g. in hobbies and work). The impact of a pathology or
53    a surgical intervention in these three domains is also conditioned by personal factors (motivation,
54    capacity to develop compensatory strategies) and environmental factors (social or professional
55    context). Although impairment measurements such as imaging can provide clues regarding
56    functional prognosis, it does not provide good information about performance in everyday life,
57    especially of the hands, which are important for a great variety of activities [6–8]. For example,
58    demonstration of a bone fracture union is insufficient to determine whether a patient is capable
59    of resuming their usual activities or returning to work [9–12].
60    The patient-reported questionnaires that have been most commonly used in HS [13] are the
61    Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH) [14], the Patient Rated Wrist
                                                                                                                                          4

62    Evaluation (PRWE) [15], and the Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (CTQ) [16]. Each of these
63    questionnaires has been reported to have good psychometric properties, but each has a
64    particular focus on its own area(s) of disablement. The DASH assesses body functions, activities,
65    and participation [17] and can be divided into 3 subscales based on dimensionality [18].
66    Meanwhile, the PRWE is specific to the wrist joint and the CTQ is specific to carpal tunnel
67    syndrome (CTS). The Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) [19] is a multidimensional
68    hand-specific outcomes instrument consisting of six subscales, measuring overall hand function,
69    activities of daily living, pain, work performance, aesthetics, and satisfaction. It measures
70    impairment by hand (left and right separately), rather than overall disability. Interpretation of
71    total scores on multi-dimensional instruments can be less than straightforward given that
72    patients can show simultaneous improvement in one domain with deterioration in another
73    [20,21]. Assessment of functional recovery on a unidimensional [22] and linear [21] scale would
74    allow for quantitative comparisons of ability among different patients and treatments. Such a
75    scale can be developed with state-of-the-art psychometric methods, such as the Rasch model
76    [23,24].
77    The ABILHAND questionnaire is a Rasch-model built measure of manual ability [25] that provides
78    an invariant linear scale and allows for quantitative comparisons of manual ability between
79    patients and over time. The scale has been validated in populations with rheumatoid arthritis
80    [26], chronic stroke [8], pediatric cerebral palsy [27], systemic sclerosis [28] and neuromuscular
81    diseases [29]. These previous validations have shown that the difficulty of most manual activities
82    was diagnosis-dependent [30]. Therefore, the objective of this work was to adapt the ABILHAND
83    scale to the most frequent diagnoses treated in HS.
                                                                                                                                          5

 84    Methods
 85    Questionnaire adaptation to HS patients
 86    The ABILHAND is a measure of manual ability that assesses one’s ability to manage daily activities
 87    requiring upper limb use, regardless of strategy [25]. The necessary permissions were obtained
 88    from the developer of the original questionnaire to modify it. To develop a HS-adapted
 89    ABILHAND, a preliminary item list was compiled from previous versions of the ABILHAND
 90    questionnaire, the DASH, PRWE, CTQ, and MHQ items together with some new items. This pool
 91    of items was submitted to nine HS experts (hand surgeons, physical medicine and rehabilitation
 92    physicians, physical therapists, and occupational therapists), who were asked to assess each
 93    item’s relevance to hand surgery patients on a yes/no basis and propose additional items that
 94    might be affected by the relevant pathologies (e.g. sensation for CTS and wrist loading for distal
 95    radius fractures (DRF)). A final list of 90 items constituted the experimental ABILHAND-HS
 96    questionnaire (S4 Appendix).
 97    Patients
 98    A convenience sample of 216 patients was recruited from February 2018 to February 2019 at the
 99    HS consultation center at Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Belgium representing the following
100    four diagnostic categories: CTS, DRF, basal thumb arthritis (BTA), and heavy wrist surgery (HWS,
101    including 1st row carpectomy and partial or total wrist arthrodesis). The inclusion criteria for
102    patients were being >18 years old and being able to read and understand French. The exclusion
103    criteria included comorbidities that may impede manual ability substantially (i.e. tremor, paralysis
104    and active rheumatologic disease) and any mental or cognitive dysfunction (i.e. dementia and
                                                                                                                                           6

111    Procedures
112    The French-language experimental ABILHAND-HS items were presented in five random orders to
113    avoid a systematic item sequence bias. Patients were asked to indicate their perceived difficulty
114    associated with completing the activities without technical or human assistance, independent of
115    the hand used to perform the activity on a three-level scale: impossible (0), difficult (1), or easy
116    (2) [8]. Activities not attempted during the last week were treated as missing responses. Patients
117    also completed the QuickDASH [31], 12-item Short Form Survey (SF-12) questionnaire [32] and a
118    10-level numerical pain scale, for external validation purposes.
119    Patients were first assessed as soon as they presented to their hand surgery consultation
120    appointments and had experienced manual activities in their own environment: after hand
121    surgery and cast removal for DRF, BTA and HWS and at the first consultation for non-operated
122    CTS and BTA. For the first assessment, patients were interviewed by the principal investigator in
123    order to ensure clarity, obtain feedback from participants, and make sure instructions are
124    properly followed. Patients were also asked to suggest additional items they felt the
125    questionnaire was missing. However, these were either gender related (e.g. fastening a bra) or
126    very specific and were thus not retained. Follow-up assessments were completed in our
127    consulting office or returned by mail, leading to a total of 305 completed assessments, which
128    provides sufficient power to support the planned Rasch analysis [33].
129    Rasch analysis
130    The 90-item experimental ABILHAND-HS questionnaire responses were analyzed using the Rasch
131    model in RUMM2030 software (RUMM Laboratory Pty Ltd., Perth, Australia). The Rasch model
                                                                                                                                           9

132    [24], a prescriptive model, requires that specified response probabilities depend on only item
133    difficulty and patient ability. Polytomous datasets with thresholds between successive response
134    categories can be analyzed with either a rating scale model that constrains all threshold locations
135    to be equal across items [34] or a partial credit model that allows threshold locations to vary
136    across items [35]. Patient abilities and item difficulties are located along a common linear,
137    unidimensional continuum that defines the latent variable of interest (i.e. manual ability). The
138    locations are expressed in logits, calculated as the logarithm of the pass/fail probability ratio of
139    an item or threshold. The logit locations were converted into centiles to facilitate clinical
140    interpretation on a linear scale ranging from 0% (smallest ability) to 100% (largest ability) [36].
141    Expected responses, determined based on the patient and item locations, were compared to the
142    responses actually reported to compute residual and fit statistics, which were then used to assess
143    the scale’s unidimensionality [37]. A good fit of the data with the model affirms invariant locations
144    along the continuum and indicates that the measure can be used to compare manual ability
145    across patients and diagnoses.
146    Item selection
147    From the experimental version of the questionnaire, the ABILHAND-HS was refined through
148    successive analyses of 305 assessments with the goal of selecting items that define a
149    unidimensional and clinically relevant scale of manual ability. P values < 0.05 were considered
150    significant for each of the following analysis steps:
                                                                                                                                          10

151    1) Item-patient targeting. Based on examination of patient distributions and item locations,
152         items that showed a floor effect (too easy) or did not target the patients sample ability were
153         removed.
154    2) Rating scale. Items with disordered thresholds and items with thresholds that were too
155         narrow (<1.4 logits) or too wide (>5 logits) were removed before applying the rating scale
156         model [38].
157    3) Unidimensionality. Only items that delineated a common manual ability construct according
158         to the following four criteria were retained: (1) standardized residuals obtained over three
159         class intervals had to be within ±2.5 with a non-significant χ2 [37]; (2) no observable major
160         differential item functioning (DIF) [39], uniform or non-uniform, shown by a 2-way analysis of
161         variance of the residuals with Bonferroni correction [40], according to gender (male vs.
162         female), age (above vs. below the median age of 63 years), pathology (CTS vs. DRF vs. BTA vs.
163         HWS), involved hand (dominant vs. non-dominant), level of education (basic vs. superior), and
164         follow-up (0-3 months vs. 3–6 months vs. >6 months); (3) overall fit of the response set based
165         on a non-significant item-trait interaction χ2 [37]; and (4) statistically similar patient locations,
166         according to paired t-tests, calculated with items that loaded either positively or negatively
167         on the first residuals principal component [41–43].
168    4) Local independence. When items were found to be querying redundant content [44],
169         demonstrated by a residual correlation > 0.3, the item with the poorer fit statistic was deleted
170         [45].
171    5) Item redundancy. To shorten the scale, when two or more items had similar locations on the
172         continuum, the one with the best fit was retained.
                                                                                                                                          11

173    Scale reliability
174    The Person-Separation Index (PSI), i.e. the proportion of total variance (including error) that is
175    attributed to patient location variance, was used to determine the ABILHAND-HS scale’s reliability
176    and its degree of precision with the dataset, and thus how many statistically different ability strata
177    can be distinguished along the scale [46].
178    Construct validity
179    The construct validity of the ABILHAND-HS was examined with a comparison of means for
180    associations with gender, involved hand, and diagnosis. The relationships of the ABILHAND-HS
181    with age, the QuickDASH scale, the numerical pain scale, the SF-12 Physical Component Summary
182    (PCS), and the SF-12 Mental Component Summary (MCS) were assessed with a correlation
183    analysis.
184    Patient perceptions were compared between ABILHAND-HS and QuickDASH items by adding the
185    six QuickDASH activity items to the anchored data matrix. The locations of similar items were then
186    compared between the scales.
187    Statistical analyses
188    Statistical analyses were completed in IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 25 (IBM Corp.,
189    Armonk, N.Y., USA). Data normality was verified for statistical tests using the Shapiro-Wilk test
190    and Q-Q plots. Parametric tests were used for normal data and continuous variables, non-
191    parametric tests for non-normal data and ordinal variables. A Mann-Whitney u-test (two-tailed)
192    was used for gender differences, an independent-samples t-test (two-tailed) for association with
                                                                                                                                          12

193    the involved hand, and an analysis of variance for diagnosis. Pearson correlation coefficient was
194    calculated for association with age, while relationships with the QuickDASH scale, the numerical
195    pain scale, the SF-12 Physical Component Summary (PCS), and the SF-12 Mental Component
196    Summary (MCS) were assessed with Spearman correlation coefficients. P values < 0.05 were
197    considered significant. Mean values are reported with standard deviations (SD). Chi-square and t
198    values are reported with degrees of freedom (df).
199    Results
200    Item selection for the ABILHAND-HS scale
201    Successive analyses led to the selection of 23 items defining a unidimensional manual ability scale
202    in HS. Of the 90 experimental items, 34 were removed because they were too easy (e.g. ‘Drinking
203    a glass of water’), 3 items had too-narrow thresholds (e.g. ‘Using a touch screen’), 4 items were
204    misfitting (e.g. ‘Carrying a shopping bag’), and 26 items had a location redundant with another
205    better fitting item (e.g. ‘Peeling onions’ was deleted in favor of ‘Peeling potatoes with a knife’).
206    Metric properties
207    The calibration obtained for the 23 mostly bimanual activities retained for ABILHAND-HS is
208    reported in Table 2 in descending difficulty order. The standardized residuals obtained matched
209    the expected standard normal distribution for items [mean (SD), -0.30 (0.99)] and for patients
210    [0.31 (0.97)], indicating that the ABILHAND-HS scale is globally unidimensional. An invariant item
211    location was obtained for more- and less- able patients as shown by a nonsignificant item-trait
212    interaction (χ² = 57.76, 46 df, p = 0.11). An invariant patient ability was obtained with items with
                                                                                                                                          13

217    Analysis of DIF of the ABILHAND-HS with six criteria yielded only four instances of uniform DIF
218    among the 23 items (Table 3). A small magnitude DIF was revealed among diagnoses (Fig 1) with
219    no substantial impact on scale invariance, as evidenced by a good overall fit. Note that items
220    were not specifically calibrated to the HWS group because of a limited sample size (n=23) [47].
221    No DIF was observed between the first and last assessments, showing satisfactory invariance to
222    support the scale follow-up stability. Likewise, an intraclass correlation coefficient across the first

238    Scale description
239    The ABILHAND-HS structure and targeting of HS patients are illustrated in Fig 2, showing an
240    average patients’ manual ability of 1.17 logits (SD = 1.85 logits; i.e. 58 (15) centiles). Twenty-four
241    patients (7.9%) were able to perform all 23 activities easily, and were thus identified as extreme
242    patients. Extreme patients tended to be younger men evaluated more than 6 months after
243    treatment, and were more likely to have a CTS rather than a HWS. The three response categories
244    were well distinguished in HS patients, with an inter-threshold distance of 2.93 logits (24 centiles),
245    indicating that, regardless of patient ability, rating an item as ‘easy’ is about 20 (i.e. e 2.93=18.7)
246    times more difficult than rating it as ‘impossible’. Although the threshold distribution (range, -
247    4.15 to 5 logits) was well targeted to the range of patient abilities, the patients’ ability levels
248    skewed high, indicating that the scale could measure patients that are more severely disabled
249    than in this sample.

251    whole sample expressed in logits (log of the pass/fail probability ratio) and centiles (fraction of

253    easily, and were thus identified as extreme patients. None of the participants reported that they
254    could not perform any of the 23 activities. Middle: most probable patient response to each item

257    (bottom) difficult. The distance between thresholds (middle bar) is constant for all items (2.93
258    logits or 24 centiles). A patient with a manual ability measure of 0 logits would be expected to
259    perform the first 3 activities easily, to have some difficulty with the following 17 activities, and
260    to be unable to perform the 3 most difficult activities. A patient with a measure of 2.1 logits
261    should be able to perform all activities easily or with some difficulty. Bottom: conversion of
262    ordinal raw scores into a linear continuum of manual ability for complete response sets. The raw
263    scores ranged from 0 to 46 (sum of scores of 0–2 for 23 items). This curve is linear in its central
264    (30th~70th percentile) range, with sigmoid flattening outside the central range, highlighting a
265    non-linear relationship, especially at the extremities of the score range.
266    Construct validity
267    ABILHAND-HS measures were normally distributed across the whole sample and subgroups,
268    except for men (W = 0.97; 100 df; p = 0.038). An effect of gender on ABILHAND-HS manual ability
269    measures was observed, with men [1.88 (2.39) logits; median 1.74 logits] reporting a significantly
270    higher mean manual ability than women [1.32 (1.93) logits; median 1.4 logits; U = 8642; p =
271    0.026]. Manual ability was not found to be significantly associated with age (R = -0.04; p = 0.47),
272    the hand involved (t = 0.96; 303 df; p = 0.37), or the patient’s diagnosis (F = 1.92; 3 df; p = 0.12).
273    Although variance across diagnosis groups was not significant, we did observe a broad spectrum
274    of manual ability. Patients with CTS reported the highest manual ability [1.9 (2.0) logits], followed
275    by patients with BTA [1.5 (2.3) logits], DRF [1.4 (2.1) logits], and HWS [0.9 (1.8) logits].
276    The relationships between ABILHAND-HS measures and scores obtained with other instruments
277    are shown in Fig 3. Briefly, ABILHAND-HS correlated strongly with QuickDASH scores, moderately
                                                                                                                                          18

287    Discussion
288    Here, we report the adaptation and validation of an ABILHAND-HS questionnaire for use with HS
289    patients. Impairments present in our study cohort included weakness (e.g. following DRF), loss of
290    sensation (e.g. in CTS), and stiffness (e.g. in BTA), with some patients presenting with a
291    combination of these impairments. The ABILHAND-HS was constructed to measure manual ability
292    on a common, linear, and unidimensional scale wherein the 23 activities retained delineate an
293    invariant item difficulty hierarchy independent of patient diagnosis. All ABILHAND-HS activities
294    with the exception of one involve both hands and, consistent with our clinical experience, the
295    most difficult ones require high levels of force (e.g. ‘doing push-ups’ loads the wrist in extension).
296    Of the experimental 90 items, those that could be interpreted in different ways, for instance using
297    the injured or uninjured hand, were misfitting and thus omitted (e.g. ‘carrying a shopping bag’).
298    The sample size was adequate for the statistical interpretation of fit statistics [33], and was within
                                                                                                                                          19

299    the same range of studies dealing with the development of outcome measures [14,15,19,31]. The
300    fit statistics for the 23 retained items support the item hierarchy invariance across the latent trait
301    [49]. A few instances of minor DIF were retained to maintain the scale’s construct validity [50].
302    The resulting scale is well targeted to the studied HS population, despite a small persistent ceiling
303    effect, most likely due to missing responses for the most difficult activities. This observation of
304    apparent ceiling effect involves 7.9% (24/305) of the records, which is well below the maximum
305    recommended allowance of 15% [51].
306    Although reliability indices should be compared with caution across potentially different study
307    conditions, it is noteworthy that the PSI obtained for the ABILHAND-HS (0.90) was higher than
308    prior values obtained for the activities subscales of the PRWE [52] (0.78 and 0.81 for the usual
309    and specific activities subscales, respectively, in DRF patients), for the Patient-Rated Wrist and
310    Hand Evaluation [53] (0.83 in HS patients), for the QuickDASH scale [54] (0.84 in patients with
311    various upper limb dysfunctions) and for the Manual Ability Measure [55] (MAM-16; 0.83 for HS
312    patients), while being equal to that for the DASH manual functioning subscale [18]. PSI values
313    reflect sensitivity to clinical evolution over time, with greater values indicating a greater number
314    of distinguishable ability strata. We obtained person separation among patients using three
315    response levels (impossible, difficult, and easy), consistent with previous studies showing patients
316    unable to discriminate more than three levels of difficulty (ABILHAND [8], DASH activity items
317    [18] and QuickDASH activity items [54]).
318    Accurate communication of scale administration instructions is critical for targeting patient
319    manual ability as defined by the ABILHAND-HS. Generally, patients focus on their ability to
320    perform the queried activities with their injured hand; likewise, the PRWE explores use of the
                                                                                                                                          20

321    affected hand explicitly [15]. The ABILHAND-HS, like the QuickDASH, is oriented towards real daily
322    life behaviors and is intended to be independent of the limb(s) or strategy used and unbiased by
323    activities that are never performed with the affected hand or avoided during recovery [8]. Our
324    findings of stable item calibrations and lack of DIF across the assessments indicate that the
325    ABILHAND-HS can be used confidently to assess the patient recovery at different time points
326    during follow-up. Moreover, the stability of items hierarchy between the first and last evaluation
327    indicate that the results were not influenced by the method of administration (interview with the
328    investigator versus self-reported).
329    ABILHAND-HS construct validation results fit well with our clinical observations. The patients with
330    the highest manual ability scores on the ABILHAND-HS also had the highest SF-12 PCS and SF-12
331    MCS scores as well as the lowest QuickDASH and numerical pain scale scores, which was also
332    observed in other validation studies [15,19]. Correlations of ABILHAND-HS with other
333    instruments, including the QuickDASH, SF-12 and a pain scale are also consistent with prior
334    findings suggesting that generic instruments are less sensitive than specific ones [56]. The present
335    ABILHAND-HS manual ability scores were not related significantly to age, consistent with other
336    versions of the ABILHAND [8,26,29]. Our findings of a small, but significant gender effect, with
337    men tending to report a higher manual ability than women (mean difference, 0.56 logits), varied
338    across HS diagnoses but, generally, were consistent with previous reports in patients with DRFs
339    and wrist arthrodesis [57–59]. A possible explanation is that manual ability is related to grip
340    strength, which is more important in men compared to women [8,60]. The construct validity of
341    the ABILHAND-HS was further supported by our confirmation of a similar item difficulty hierarchy
342    for QuickDASH items in our patients sample. Notably, those ABILHAND-HS activities that require
                                                                                                                                          21

343    a great amount of force (e.g. ‘Opening a screw-topped jar’) have been reported to likewise be
344    among the most difficult items in the DASH and QuickDASH [18,54] and in the MAM-16 [55].
345    The ABILHAND-HS, developed using Rasch methodology, has several advantages over
346    questionnaires developed using classical test theory. These are summarized in Table 4. Firstly, the
347    ABILHAND-HS can tolerate missing responses, which enables it to remain valid even in patients
348    who scarcely perform some of the queried activities. Secondly, the ability to analyze response
349    patterns can identify those patients whose responses do not fit the model due to random or
350    careless answers, a particular injury or comorbidities. Finally, the high precision of the ABILHAND-
351    HS items minimizes the need for interpretation, thereby allowing more reliable comparisons
352    between patients (e.g. recreational activities involving force or impact are broken down into the
353    items ‘doing push-ups’, ‘practicing a racket sport’).

357    Limitations of this research include a sample of patients with hand and wrist disabilities from one

360    DRF and CTS [15,16,31] and the DIF analysis allowed us to select items where the diagnosis and
361    gender effects were absent. Future studies with a larger sample size should confirm or refine our

362    findings. Furthermore, the way participants responded to the 90 items in the questionnaire may
363    not be the same as responses to the final 23-item instrument. One limitation to the availability of
364    Rasch model-based questionnaires is that they have a complex statistical background and require
365    the use of dedicated computer programs that are not easy to learn and implement. To facilitate
366    and spread the use of the ABILHAND-HS, a website (www.rehab-scales.org) developed by
367    Université catholique de Louvain and Arsalis, a spin-off of the ABILHAND authors’ laboratory, can
368    be used to convert the questionnaire raw scores into manual ability measures. The web service is
369    free-to-use for daily practice in clinical and research applications although a license is required
370    for commercial applications and for clinical trials.
371    Conclusion
372    ABILHAND-HS was demonstrated to be a successful adaptation for application in HS patients. The
373    resulting scale was shown to be a valid, patient-oriented, clinically meaningful and precise
374    instrument. It targets commonly performed manual activities and allows stable and linear
375    measurement of manual ability over multiple time points in patients treated for DRF, BTA, CTS,
376    or HWS. The scale reveals unexpected responses that may provide clues regarding the patient’s
377    clinical state, as summarized at www.rehab-scales.org. The questionnaire is available online, and
378    the web service is free-to-use for daily practice in clinical and research applications although a
379    license is required for commercial applications and for clinical trials. Future research should
380    include more patients with HWS, as well as other diagnoses such as tendinopathies, ligamentous
381    injuries and complex hand injuries, and an assessment of scale responsiveness.
                                                                                                                                          24
