Abstract
Background: Omega-3 or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are widely studied for health benefits based on
potential anti-inflammatory effects. However, the factors involved in mediating the anti-inflammatory responses to n-3
PUFAs are not fully understood; furthermore, many effects from n-3 PUFA treatment are not well characterized in
humans. Of interest is the role of DNA methylation (DNAm) in mediating the effects of n-3 PUFAs on inflammation.
Objective: We aimed to characterize the effects of n-3 PUFA treatment on DNAm in inflammation-related signaling
pathways in PBMCs of women at high risk of breast cancer
Methods: PBMCs of women at high risk of breast cancer were obtained at 0 and 6 months of n-3 PUFA treatment
in a previously reported dose finding trial (n=10 matched pairs in the 5 g/day EPA+DHA dose arm).[53] DNA
methylation of PBMCs were assayed using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to obtain genome-wide
methylation profiles on a single nucleotide level. Analyses were performed to investigate the effects of n-3 PUFA
treatment on DNAm both genome-wide and within a set of candidate genes.
Results: A large number of differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) in gene promoters (24,842 DMCs in 5507 genes)
showed significant enrichment for hypermethylation in both the candidate gene and genome-wide analyses. Using
these DNAm changes, pathway analysis identified significantly hypermethylated signaling networks after n-3 PUFA
treatment, such as the Toll-like Receptor pathway. Based on analyses of data per individual, DNAm changes from n-3
PUFA treatment appear highly variable between study participants.
Conclusions: Dietary n-3 PUFA supplementation for six months is associated with DNAm changes in PBMCs with
potential for anti-inflammatory effects. PBMC DNAm profiles may offer a novel means of assessing individual
response to n-3 PUFAs. This observation warrants further investigation in future n-3 PUFA intervention studies.
Introduction                                                                                                                                       1
Dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have health benefits for a wide range of diseases in both preclinical                              2

supplementation by assessing responses of PBMCs. Previous studies involving healthy volunteers showed that fish oil                            11
supplement reduced the production of cytokines including interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and tumor                                 12
necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) by mononuclear cells.[13, 14, 17] Gene expression studies of PBMCs from healthy                                   13
subjects taking fish oil (775 mg/d EPA) and borage oil (831 mg/d gamma linolenic acid) supplements for four weeks                              14
demonstrated decreased expression of PI3Kα and PI3Kγ, key mediators of pro-inflammatory signal transduction, and                               15
cytokines (IL-1, IL-10, IL-23) via quantitative RT-PCR.[51] In a study of older adults, treatment with 1.8 g/day                               16
EPA+DHA for six months resulted in PBMCs with decreased pro-inflammatory gene expression involving the                                         17
interleukin, MAP kinase, NF-κB, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways.[8] DHA-rich n-3 PUFA supplements (1.7                               18

lipopolysaccharide (LPS), without decreases in TNFα, IL-10.[49] Corresponding analyses of PBMC gene expression                                 21
showed changes consistent with an anti-inflammatory effect, although without correlation to the cytokines and                                  22
growth factors induced by LPS.[50] The specific cytokines affected may relate to the dose, duration, and composition                           23
of n-3 PUFA supplements in addition to patient-related factors.                                                                                24
    Epigenetic regulation of gene expression may mediate, at least in part, the anti-inflammatory effects of dietary n-3                       25
PUFAs. DNAm is one mechanism by which pro-inflammatory genes are silenced, as shown in prior reports of                                        26
epigenetic regulation of inflammation in a wide range of cell types including PBMCs,[6, 44] CD4+ lymphocytes,[35]                              27
and breast cancer cell lines.[8, 19] Regarding the role of dietary n-3 PUFAs in modulating the epigenome, a                                    28

long chain marine n-3 PUFA intake showed potential impact of DNAm on anti-inflammatory pathway genes.[5]                                       30
Modulating effects of n-3 PUFAs on DNAm that affect inflammatory and metabolic signaling pathways are also                                     31
evident in short term intervention trials of n-3 PUFAs.[12, 21, 47]                                                                            32
    To further elucidate the effects of dietary n-3 PUFAs on epigenetic regulation of inflammation-related signal                              33
transduction, we examined DNAm changes in PBMCs of women at high risk of breast cancer following six months of                                 34
n-3 PUFA supplementation. We utilized reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to analyze DNAm on a                                  35
genome-wide level with single base-pair resolution and coverage of many more sites than array-based methods.                                   36

PBMCs were isolated via ficoll-hypaque separation from peripheral blood collected in acid citrate dextrose (ACD)                               39
blood tubes as part of a study of n-3 PUFAs in women at high risk of breast cancer; the main results of the trial were                         40
previously reported.[53] In brief, 48 women at high risk of breast cancer were randomly assigned to one of four daily                          41
doses of n-3 PUFAs (0.84, 2.52, 5.04, or 7.56 g/d of EPA+DHA) for 6 months of treatment. The study was                                         42
conducted with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of The Ohio State University and in accordance with                              43
ethical standards of the 1975 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. PBMCs were processed within 4 hours                               44
of collection and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until analysis. In the present study, we utilized PBMCs obtained at                         45
0 and 6 months of 5.04 g/d EPA+DHA from the 10 of 12 sample sets with highest increase in DHA/EPA at 6                                         46
months. This dose is utilized in an ongoing phase II trial (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT02295059).                                                47
DNAm Data Generation, Processing, and Quantification                                                                                           48
DNAm data was generated for all samples using the RRBS method.[31] Prior to library generation, DNA was                                        49
extracted using QIAamp DNA mini kit from QIAGEN. Sequencing libraries were created using the NEXTflex                                          50
Bisulfite Library Prep Kit for Illumina Sequencing from BIOO following the manufacturer’s protocol. All samples                                51
were sequenced using 100bp paired-end technology. Sequenced reads were first trimmed for both adapter sequences                                52

and low quality using TrimGalore v0.4.0 (a wrapper for Cutadapt) which removed any detected Illumina adapters or                               53
bases with Phred quality scores below 20 from the 3’ end of each read.[33] Next, reads were aligned using Bismark                              54
v0.17.0 to the human genome (version GRCh38).[40] Bismark alignment was performed using Bowtie 2 and the                                       55
minimum alignment scoring function set to “L,-0.6,-0.6”. Quality was assessed using FastQC v0.10.1, trimming                                   56
reports, and alignment reports to ensure low adapter, low quality trimming rates, low incomplete conversion, and                               57
acceptable unique alignment rates for each sample. Additional reads were sequenced until each sample had 30 million                            58
reads that passed the quality filter. After passing our quality assessment, DNAm was quantified as the percent of                              59
CpG sites that are methylated in the sample using Bismark’s “bismark methylation extractor” function. Additional                               60
processing of DNAm quantification (i.e. filtering CpGs based on read depth, extracting coverage, generating coverage                           61
plots, etc.) was performed by custom scripts written in R v3.3.2 and Python v2.7.8.                                                            62
Power analysis and Sample Size Determination                                                                                                   63
To determine how many samples should be included in this study, we performed a power analysis based on detecting                               64
average DNAm differences at CpG loci of 5% in PBMCs. The variance for PBMC DNAm was determined using                                           65
publicly available data. Control PBMC samples assayed for DNAm using the Illumina Infinium 450k array were used                                66
to determine the standard deviation (SD) in DNAm at CpGs as a function of DNAm (GEO series GSE57107). A fit                                    67
of the SD values produced a maximum value at 50% DNAm (max of fit SD values = 0.30; data not shown). For the                                   68
power analysis, a more conservative SD of 0.65 which corresponds to the 95th percentile of all CpGs was used. The                              69
power analysis was conducted using an FDR corrected alpha = 0.05 to account for multiple testing of the CpGs in                                70
the promoter region of our candidate genes. We found that 20 total samples (10 baseline and 10 after treatment)                                71
produced sufficient statistical power for detecting a 5% difference in average DNAm of 96%. Based on this analysis,                            72
we selected 10 paired samples (10 baseline and 10 after six months n-3 PUFA treatment) with the most consistent                                73
increase in EPA and DHA of the 12 participants in the 6 capsule/day dosing arm of the n-3 PUFA phase I clinical                                74
trial.[53] The variation in our DNAm data, which was assayed using the RRBS method, was lower than in the public                               75
data used for the power analysis (Supplemental Figure 4).                                                                                      76
Summarizing DNAm Genome-wide                                                                                                                   77
Global DNAm levels were determined using the total number of unconverted (methylated) cytosines at CpG sites                                   78
divided by the total coverage at CpG sites genome wide. Only CpGs with at least 5 reads coverage in at least 3                                 79
samples in both treatment groups were included in the global DNAm average. The treatment group averages for all                                80
CpGs that achieved the coverage and sample threshold were plotted to create experiment wide DNAm scatter plots.                                81
All plotted CpGs were fitted using orthogonal regression (ODR function from the SciPy library in Python) with the                              82
standard deviation used as the error for each CpG (SciPy.org). We selected orthogonal regression, as opposed to the                            83
more traditional linear regression, as it provides the most accurate estimation of the error in the case of our null                           84
hypothesis of no DNAm change from n-3 PUFA treatment (illustrated by the y=x line). Linear regression assumes                                  85
that only one variable produces the observed error for each measurement whereas orthogonal regression assumes that                             86
both variables contribute to the observed error.                                                                                               87
Genomic Feature Summaries                                                                                                                      88
DNAm for annotated genomic features were summarized differently. First, all CpGs within a region that had at least                             89
five reads coverage were averaged to produce an average DNAm for each region. Next, the averages for all regions                               90
that comprise a genomic feature were again averaged into one DNAm value that was used to represent the DNAm for                                91
that genomic feature. Feature summaries were performed on the genomic features where DNAm has been implicated                                  92
as playing a role in regulating gene expression. Therefore, CpG islands, two definitions of the promoter region, CpG                           93
islands located in the distal promoter, gene bodies, and the 1st coding exon of each gene were interrogated for DNAm                           94
changes. The two promoter regions were defined to create a long-range and a short-range promoter (10kb upstream,                               95
1kb downstream and 1kb upstream, 1kb downstream, respectively, of the transcriptional start site [TSS]).                                       96
                                                                                                                                        3/17

Candidate Gene List Development                                                                                                                 97
All GDAC Firehose analysis results and data were downloaded to access their 8,586 gene DNAm table (Broad                                        98
Institute TCGA Genome Data Analysis Center [GDAC] 2012). The DNAm table provided data in the format of 450k                                     99
Infinium array beta-values for each of the 8,586 most varying probes which were associated with gene symbols.                                  100
Pathway membership for each gene was obtained by querying against Gene Ontology, KEGG, and Reactome using                                      101
each site’s API.[26, 27, 39] Genes involved in inflammation related pathways were kept resulting in 89 inflammation                            102
related genes that are highly variable in breast cancer. An additional 63 genes were identified by performing                                  103
literature searches in June of 2015 and again in May of 2016 using combinations of the main keywords in both                                   104
PubMed and Google Scholar: n-3 PUFA, fatty acids, n-3 PUFA, inflammation, DNA methylation, PBMC, cancer,                                       105
breast cancer, prevention, biomarker. These 63 genes and their references are provided in Supplemental Table 2. The                            106
genes that resulted from the literature search were all reported to play a role in or have been affected (DNAm or                              107
expression levels) by fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid related inflammation, or breast cancer inflammation. The                               108
resulting 152 genes (Supplemental Table 2) are the candidate genes.                                                                            109
     Unsupervised clustering was performed using the same non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method used in                               110
the original GDAC analysis, but was implemented in R using the NMF package (v0.20.6) for analysis convenience[29]                              111
(Supplemental Figure 1A). Analysis in R was successful in reproducing sample membership of clusters reported by                                112
GDAC. To perform NMF on candidate genes, the full 450k Infinium Array data was downloaded from TCGA for the                                    113
entire breast cancer cohort so that DNAm beta values could be obtained. Metadata (sample and experiment numbers                                114
as well as clinical classification) were downloaded so that sample IDs could be converted and matched. Using only the                          115
samples included in the original GDAC analysis and selecting the most varying probe for each candidate gene, the                               116
152 candidate gene beta-value table was constructed. NMF was performed and quality measures calculated for 2-10                                117
clusters. As in the GDAC analysis, the quality measures cophenetic similarity, dispersion, and silhouette coefficients                         118
all indicated that six clusters resulted in the best separation (Supplemental Figure 1C). Molecular markers ER, PR,                            119
and HER2, Triple Negative status, and PAM50 subtype, were all used to determine if the six resultant sample                                    120
clusters corresponded to clinically relevant classifications. Both the original 8,586 GDAC clusters and the candidate                          121
gene clusters were annotated with clinical classification to observe associations. However, as with the original                               122
clustering, clustering did not stratify samples based on any single or combination of molecular markers included in                            123
the metadata. Although clustering could not be explained by molecular markers, we did observe that both the                                    124
original GDAC cluster and our clustering showed a general separation between luminal and basal-like breast cancers.                            125
For both the GDAC gene list and our candidate gene list, the majority of the basal-like samples were present in a                              126
single cluster (Supplemental Figure 1 B&D). The stratification of these subtypes supports the observed differential                            127
expression in breast cancer marker genes that was also reported in the original GDAC analysis. Additionally, the fact                          128
that our candidate gene list performs similarly implies that our greatly reduced gene list is also able to discern                             129
differences in the genes responsible for resulting in different breast cancer subtypes.                                                        130
DMC Analysis and Association with Gene Promoters                                                                                               131
DMCs were determined between treatment groups using MethylKit v1.2.0.20 All CpGs with 10 reads coverage in at                                  132
least 16 samples were input into MethylKit resulting in a total of 962,093 CpGs being tested (Figure 2A). A DMC                                133
had a SLIM multiple test corrected p-value less than 0.05 and at least a 5% average DNAm change between treatment                              134
groups. DMCs in candidate genes were found by intersecting all DMCs with the promoters and promoter associated                                 135
CpG islands of the candidate genes. Promoter DMCs were identified as any DMC that was in a region 10k base-pair                                136
(bp) upstream and 1k bp downstream of transcriptional start sites of RefSeq genes (hg38). To ensure that DMCs were                             137
associated with n-3 PUFA treatment effect and not explained by any confounders, we performed linear regression and                             138
correlation analysis for each DMC. Using linear regression, DNAm at DMCs of all samples were compared to both                                  139
the fatty acid levels and estimated cell type composition as determined by methylCC [20]; DMCs where the resulting                             140
fit had an FDR p-value ≤ 0.1 with any confounding variable were removed. The maximum R2 of the DMCs that                                       141
passed this filtering process and were used in subsequent analyses was 0.58. Additionally, we used a paired t-test to                          142
test for changes in the estimated fraction after n-3 PUFA treatment for each cell type present (i.e. granulocyte,                              143
CD4+, CD8+, B cells, monocytes, natural killer cells); no significant changes were detected (data not shown).                                  144
                                                                                                                                        4/17

DMC Pathway Analysis and Directional Enrichment                                                                                                145
Genome wide promoter DMCs were analyzed for enrichment of inflammation related pathways to show the                                            146
involvement of inflammation in PUFA treatment. DMCs were input into IPA[34] and the Enrichr[1] web tool to                                     147
obtain results from Biocarta, KEGG, NCI-Nature, Panther, Reactome, and WikiPathways.[28, 36, 38, 39, 42, 42, 45] All                           148
significantly enriched pathways (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05) were extracted. Inflammation related pathways were                                   149
identified based on processes previously reported to be involved in inflammation.[1, 28, 38, 42, 45, 45, 48]                                   150
Enrichment of Pathways for Directional DNAm Change                                                                                             151
Candidate gene promoter DMCs were used to determine which inflammation-related WikiPathways were enriched in                                   152
n-3 PUFA treatment DNAm changes.[42, 45] Directional enrichment was determined using the genome-wide promoter                                  153
associated DMCs instead of the candidate gene promoter DMCs that were used for general enrichment.[32] The                                     154
DNAm change from n-3 PUFA treatment was determined for each gene in each pathway using all DMCs in the                                         155
promoter region. We tested for an over-representation of either hyper- or hypomethylated DMCs in each identified                               156
pathway that included at least 8 DMCs. Only genes that had a DMC in the promoter region were used to determine                                 157
directional DNAm enrichment. Because the genome-wide DMCs had a strong trend toward hypermethylation (7,129                                    158
hyper- vs 3,174 hypomethylated DMCs), the hypergeometric test was used to determine if the ratio of hyper- to                                  159
hypomethylated DMCs in each pathway was significant given the genome-wide DMC background. Pathways were                                        160
considered to be significantly enriched if the hypergeometric test produced a q-value ≤ 0.05 (FDR corrected p-value).                          161
Correlating DNAm with Fatty Acids, Serum Biomarkers, and Biometric Data                                                                        162
For each DNAm measure and each patient data type (i.e. total fatty acid, serum biomarkers, etc.), DNAm was                                     163
correlated with the patient data using linear regression. The resulting linear model was assessed by producing an R2                           164
value and multiple test corrected (FDR) p-value to control for testing multiple DNAm measures and the multiple                                 165
parameters included in the data type. Using the total fatty acids data type as an example, all total fatty acid                                166
measures (n-3 PUFA, n-6 PUFA, monounsaturated, saturated) were compared to DNAm of all six genomic features                                    167
and the resulting p-values were corrected for 24 comparisons. These correlations were performed for the baseline                               168
values, the change after n-3 PUFA treatment and the baseline vs n-3 PUFA change. This analysis used DNAm                                       169
measures of global DNAm, genomic feature summaries, and candidate gene promoter DMCs. Each DNAm measure                                        170
was compared to the patient data for total fatty acids, individual fatty acids, serum inflammation markers                                     171
(Adiponectin, Leptin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6, and TNFα ), and biometric data (age, weight, BMI,                             172
waist, waist hip circumference).                                                                                                               173
Results                                                                                                                                        174
n-3 PUFA treatment does not alter average genome-wide DNA methylation patterns                                                                 175
We previously reported the effects of four different doses of n-3 PUFAs on fatty acid profiles of women at high risk of                        176
breast cancer following six months of treatment.[53] For this PBMC DNAm substudy of 10 of 12 participants from                                 177
the 6 capsule/day arm, analysis of serum and breast adipose fatty acids yielded similar results to those previously                            178
reported.[53] The 10 women had an average age of 51 ± 6.8 years, weight of 164.5 ± 25.8 lbs., BMI of 27.1 ± 5.0,                               179
waist of 84.7 ± 9.3 cm, and waist hip circumference ratio of 0.80 ± 0.06 (mean ± SD). Averaged pre- and                                        180
post-treatment serum fatty acid profiles showed changes in the overall distribution of fatty acids, with significant                           181
increases in total n-3 PUFAs and decreases in total monounsaturated fatty acids and n-6 PUFAs after 6 months of                                182
study treatment (Figure 1A; Supplemental Table 1). Fatty acid profiles in adipose tissue also showed significantly                             183
higher n-3 PUFA content at six months compared to baseline (Figure 1A).                                                                        184
    To assess whether n-3 PUFA treatment leading to increased serum and adipose EPA, DHA resulted in a global                                  185
remodeling of DNAm patterns, we calculated the effect on average DNAm before and after treatment (n=10 matched                                 186
pairs). For a genome-wide view of DNAm, the average DNAm values of all pass-filter CpGs (≥5 reads coverage in at                               187
least 80% of samples) were plotted and the line of best fit was used to determine whether n-3 PUFAs caused a global                            188
change in DNAm (see Methods). The resulting fit, with an R2 of 0.999, indicates that DNAm averaged before and                                  189
                                                                                                                                        5/17

after treatment is unchanged at most CpG sites (Figure 1B). The average DNAm change genome-wide was only 0.7%                                  190
(50.5% pre- and 51.2% post-treatment, t-test p=not significant). We also determined the effect of dietary n-3 PUFAs                            191
on DNAm of specific regions of the genome by evaluating the change in DNAm in six annotated genomic features                                   192
that are associated with gene regulation (e.g. gene promoters and CpG Islands). In these selected genomic features,                            193
average DNAm did not change after n-3 PUFA treatment (Figure 1C).                                                                              194
n-3 PUFAs resulted in promoter hypermethylation as assessed by genome-wide and                                                                 195
candidate gene CpG-level analyses                                                                                                              196
To determine how n-3 PUFA effects on DNAm could potentially regulate gene expression, we investigated the average                              197
DNAm effects at CpG loci. A genome-wide differentially methylated CpG (DMC) analysis was conducted with                                        198
MethylKit to compare the DNAm between 0 and 6 months.[2] All CpGs in the genome with sufficient read coverage                                  199
were tested for changes in the average DNAm (see Methods). To limit the detected DNAm changes to only those                                    200
caused by the n-3 PUFA treatment, DMCs with DNAm changes significantly correlated with estimated cell type were                                201
removed (180 DMCs removed; see Methods).[20] This analysis at CpG loci identified a total of 30,793 DMCs                                       202
following n-3 PUFA treatment (DNAm change ≥ 5% and multiple test corrected p-value≤0.05; Figure 2A). To reduce                                 203
the number of DMCs and focus on those more likely to regulate gene expression [7, 24], the DMCs in the promoter                                204
region (10kb up- and 1kb down-stream from the TSS) were examined. However, this filtering still resulted in 10,261                             205
DMCs located in 5,491 gene promoters.                                                                                                          206
     Instead of performing a genome-wide analysis to investigate all DNAm-mediate effects from n-3 PUFA treatment,                             207
we focused the analysis based on our hypothesis that n-3 PUFA treatment affects inflammation and breast cancer                                 208
pathways. Before conducting experiments, we developed a set of candidate genes based on two criteria: 1) genes                                 209
involved in inflammation that showed high levels of variation and stratified the breast cancer subtypes in the Cancer                          210
Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer data set (89 genes; GDAC Analysis 2012; see Methods for more details) and 2)                                 211
genes associated with breast cancer (36 genes) and fatty acid induced effects (33 genes) (Figure 2B; Supplemental                              212
Table 2). Using the resulting candidate genes (Supplemental Table 2), we demonstrated a similar stratification of the                          213
TCGA data when comparing the original 8,562 genes to our reduced set of 152 candidate genes (Supplemental Figure                               214
1). From the genome-wide promoter DMCs, candidate gene DMCs were identified by selecting only those DMCs                                       215
located in a candidate gene promoter region (Figure 2A). This approach both focused the analysis to our hypothesis                             216
and used a more stringent genome-wide multiple test correction to reduce false positives. The full genome-wide                                 217
promoter DMCs were used later in our analysis to predict the effects of n-3 PUFA treatment.                                                    218
     From the 152 candidate genes, we identified 49 candidate genes that contained at least one DMC (compared to                               219
5,491 genome-wide gene promoters). Comparing the proportion of candidate gene DMCs to genome-wide DMCs, the                                    220
candidate genes were significantly enriched in n-3 PUFA associated DMCs (hypergeometric test qval = 0.026; Figure                              221
2C-D). Both the genome-wide and candidate gene promoters were significantly enriched in hypermethylation after n-3                             222
PUFA treatment, with 68% hypermethylated genome-wide promoters and 65% hypermethylated candidate gene                                          223
promoters compared to 52% hypermethylation in all gene promoters (Figure 2D).                                                                  224
Pathway analysis identifies potential epigenetic mechanisms of n-3 PUFAs                                                                       225
To focus on those pathways of interest for n-3 PUFA effects, we then used the candidate gene promoter DMCs to                                  226
perform pathway analysis. We identified 31 pathways enriched for candidate gene promoter DMCs (adjusted p-value                                227
≤ 0.05; Supplemental Table 4). To determine which pathways were more likely to be up- or down-regulated by the                                 228
n-3 PUFA-induced DNAm changes, we utilized the genome-wide promoter DMCs. The DNAm change in each gene                                         229
promoter DMC was used to identify the pathways where n-3 PUFA treatment caused concerted treatment effects (all                                230
DMCs showing either hyper- or hypomethylation). Enrichment in directional DNAm was determined using the                                        231
hypergeometric test in all pathways with at least 8 genome-wide promoter DMCs (minimum number of DMCs to                                       232
achieve hypergeometric p-value ≤ 0.05).[43] This test yielded three pathways significantly enriched in n-3 PUFA                                233
associated DNA hypermethylation: the Focal Adhesion, Toll-like Receptor (TLR), and Leptin signaling pathways                                   234
(Figure 3A). Of these pathways, the Focal Adhesion and TLR pathways had both enrichment for DNA                                                235
hypermethylation and biologically relevant localization of DMCs (Supplemental Figures 2-3). By comparing the                                   236
DMCs detected in these pathways (Figure 3B) and the genes that comprise each pathway (Figure 3C), we noted only                                237
two shared DMCs and two shared signal transduction pathways. The localization of DMCs within each pathway has                                  238
                                                                                                                                        6/17

potential biological relevance because of the canonical relationship between increased DNAm in gene promoters and                              239
gene silencing. Notably, the hypermethylated DMCs in the Focal Adhesion pathway are located downstream of                                      240
cytokine, chemokine, and hormone signaling (Supplemental Figure 2). The TLR pathway has hypermethylated                                        241
DMCs downstream of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptors and upstream of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Supplemental                                 242
Figure 3). Taken together, these pathways represent two distinct mechanisms by which n-3 PUFAs may modulate                                    243
inflammation through DNAm changes.                                                                                                             244
Exploratory analyses of variability in PBMC DNAm after n-3 PUFA Treatment                                                                      245
Although average DNAm did not change following n-3 PUFA treatment in any of the six genomic regions analyzed                                   246
(Figure 1C), we observed highly variable DNAm patterns when comparing DNAm change in the genomic features for                                  247
each sample pair from 0 to 6 months (Figure 4A). Similarly, n-3 PUFAs did not affect average global DNAm (Figure                               248
1B), but the change per individual was highly variable (Figure 4B; mean = 0.7%; minimum= -10.5%; maximum =                                     249
12.1%). The individual fatty acid profiles did not show a similar variability between the participants (Figure 4C).                            250
    To investigate the basis for the observed individual vs average differences in DNAm in the 10 participants, we                             251
tested for correlations of DNAm with possible confounders such as BMI, age, waist, serum biomarkers (i.e.                                      252
adiponectin, leptin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6, and TNFα), fatty acid profiles (EPA, DHA, n-3 and n-6                          253
PUFA, poly- and mono-unsaturated fatty acids), and estimated cell type composition (natural killer, monocytes,                                 254
B-cells, CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells, granulocytes) using both baseline values and change from treatment. The                                   255
analyses did not reveal significant correlations between potential confounders and DNAm (global or genomic features;                           256
see Methods for further details; data not shown).                                                                                              257
    Given the observed variability in global DNAm between participants, we assessed whether the Focal Adhesion and                             258
TLR pathways, as identified by pathway analysis of statistically significant differences in average DNAm, also had                             259
variable DNAm change between participants at the CpG level. Some women showed PBMC DNAm changes in the                                         260
opposite direction when compared to the average. To illustrate this variability, we counted the number of hypo- vs                             261
hyper-methylated CpGs for each study participant for all DMCs in each of the pathways; this showed that some                                   262
participants had more hypomethylated CpGs (Figure 4D-E; CpGs with DNAm change ≥ 5%).                                                           263
Discussion                                                                                                                                     264
In this work, we demonstrate that n-3 PUFA supplementation elicits a strong, locus-specific effect on DNAm of                                  265
PBMCs in a study cohort of women at high risk of breast cancer. While average genome-wide CpG methylation was                                  266
essentially unchanged in PBMCs after six months of n-3 PUFA supplementation, analysis of DNAm changes at CpGs                                  267
(DMCs) revealed marked enrichment of hypermethylation in the promoter regions of candidate genes selected for                                  268
potential for epigenetic regulation in inflammation and breast cancer. Using the DNAm changes in gene promoters of                             269
the candidate genes, pathway analysis identified at least two pathways that might in part mediate n-3 PUFA                                     270
anti-inflammatory effects.                                                                                                                     271
    Our DNAm data also indicate a highly variable individual response to n-3 PUFA treatment in matched pairs of                                272
DNAm data at 0 and 6 months. Exploration of the genome-wide DNAm changes of each sample pair revealed                                          273
differing and even opposing DNAm effects from n-3 PUFA treatment at every scale in the genome: global DNAm                                     274
(Figure 4B), gene associated genomic features (Figure 4A), and individual CpGs (Figure 4D-E). Using linear                                     275
regression methods, variability in DNAm patterns did not correlate with demographic or anthropometric features                                 276
with known effects on DNAm such as age, menopausal status, and central obesity.[3, 11] Prior studies have noted                                277
individual variability in response to dietary n-3 PUFAs that relates to baseline parameters (e.g. fatty acid levels,                           278
BMI)[53] or genotype (e.g. variants in COX1, IL-6, FADS1, and FADS2),[30, 41, 47, 48] with potential for differential                          279
treatment effects. With the lack of consensus regarding clinical use of n-3 PUFAs, as for depression, cardiovascular                           280
disease, and cancer,[15, 22, 23, 52] PBMC DNAm profile might provide another measure of individual response to n-3                             281
PUFAs. However, as our initial sample size estimates were based on the analysis of averaged DNAm, these                                        282
observations of variability in individual DNAm response fall outside the purview of the current study.                                         283
    Our findings on n-3 PUFA effects on averaged DNAm in PBMCs are largely consistent with prior reports of                                    284
average gene expression changes after n-3 PUFA treatment. We observed both direct methylation of                                               285
pro-inflammatory genes and hypermethylation of multiple mediators in pro-inflammatory pathways that have                                       286
                                                                                                                                        7/17

previously been reported to show changes in gene expression. The pro-inflammatory genes IRAK1, CXCL16, ALOX5,                                  287
MAN2A1, HSD17B11 were hypermethylated in our study cohort, which corroborates decreases reported in previous                                   288
n-3 PUFA studies.[8, 49] We also observed hypermethylation upstream of the pro-inflammatory genes TNF, IL1B,                                   289
IL6, IL12A which corroborate the findings of others.[8, 18, 19, 37] reported significant downregulation of the TLR and                         290
the MAP kinase signaling pathways, which we also identified as significantly enriched in hypermethylated DMCs.[8]                              291
In one of the most comprehensive reports of n-3 PUFA’s effects on DNAm, Tremblay et al. used the 450k Infinium                                 292
array to demonstrate that 6 weeks of n-3 PUFA supplementation led to hypermethylated CpGs and changes in                                       293
pathways that included the inflammation-related related TLR and PI3K pathways.[47] Thus, the results of our                                    294
analyses of averaged DNAm changes are concordant with prior reports of both averaged DNAm and gene expression.                                 295
    For this study, we took the novel approach of whole genome analysis followed by a targeted strategy using a set of                         296
candidate genes developed from prior reports of n-3 PUFAs, inflammation, and breast cancer effects to test for                                 297
inflammation-related DNAm changes. The RRBS experiment uses bisulfite conversion which is the gold standard for                                298
DNAm assays. Our focused anlaysis on a hypothesis-derived set of candidate genes was conducted with a                                          299
genome-wide statistical cutoff which minimizes false positives while still focusing on inflammation. As the first                              300
opportunity to test the capability of our candidate genes to detect n-3 PUFA treatment effects, this study showed                              301
that the candidate genes were enriched in DNAm differences after n-3 PUFA treatment. To the best of our                                        302
knowledge, the six-month n-3 PUFA treatment of 5 g/day EPA+DHA resulted in detection of more gene associated                                   303
DMCs than any other reported n-3 PUFA intervention to date. In order to understand how the large number of                                     304
observed n-3 PUFA specific DNAm changes involved inflammation signaling, we focused on pathways that involved                                  305
our candidate genes and featured directionally concordant DNAm changes.[32] This approach identified at least two                              306
hypermethylated pathways involved in regulating inflammation with biologically relevant localization of DMCs with                              307
hypermethylation observed after n-3 PUFA treatment consistent with decreased inflammation or inflammatory                                      308
potential: Focal Adhesion and TLR pathways. The TLR pathway is interesting both for effects on immune response                                 309
and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines; additionally, prior reports have demonstrated modulation of TLR                                  310
signaling by n-3 PUFAs.[4, 18, 25, 37] Likewise, previous research has shown n-3 PUFA modulation of gene expression                            311
in the focal adhesion pathway[8] and of DNAm in the PI3K signaling component of the focal adhesion pathway.[47].                               312
Such concordance lends support to the findings of our study and analytic approach.                                                             313
    The limitations of this study relate primarily to the small sample size. Although 10 paired samples are sufficient                         314
for detection of average DNAm changes due to dietary n-3 PUFAs, a larger study population is needed to explore the                             315
variability of DNAm changes with n-3 PUFA treatment as well as the interplay between DNAm and biological                                       316
parameters. Despite the potential inaccuracy of estimating cell composition of PBMC specimens via indirect method                              317
of Hicks et al, we used the estimated cell populations to control for the possibility that the observed DNAm changes                           318
were caused by cell type changes. However, analysis of different cell populations for each patient specimen was                                319
outside the purview of this study. Analysis of DNAm of PBMCs from another dose group, such as 0.84 g/d n-3                                     320
PUFAs, would have also provided a useful comparison group; however, our previous dose finding study could not                                  321
statistically differentiate between 3-7 g per day arms.[53] Therefore, these results will inform future n-3 PUFA studies                       322
with interventions that achieve similar DHA, EPA levels1 Additionally, we acknowledge the potential limitations of                             323
focusing on a predetermined set of candidate genes, combined with directional enrichment of DNAm in selection of                               324
pathways; however, this analytic approach enabled identification of two inflammation-related signaling networks that                           325
have also been reported by others as responsive to n-3 PUFAs. Finally, changes in DNAm may not indicate                                        326
functional regulation of gene expression even when occurring in the promoter region.[16] We chose a broad definition                           327
of the promoter region and looked for concerted DNAm changes in pathways to increase the probability of identifying                            328
pathways under epigenetic regulation. Future studies will address the functional relationship between DNAm and                                 329
gene expression and biologic response of n-3 PUFA treatment.                                                                                   330
    Taken together, our study results demonstrate the impact of a six-month, high dose regimen of n-3 PUFAs in                                 331
women at high risk of breast cancer by assaying DNAm genome-wide in PBMCs. While changes in average global                                     332
DNAm were not apparent, our analyses of DMCs indicated hypermethylation of key pro-inflammatory signal                                         333
transduction pathways that include PI3K and TLR signaling. Further research is warranted to evaluate the potential                             334
for individual responses in PBMC DNAm and the implications for monitoring and tailoring n-3 PUFA intake.                                       335

Figure 2: Differential DNAm in a set of Candidate Genes after n-3 PUFA Treatment A) The flow chart
depicts the processing involved in identifying differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs). All CpGs with at least 5 reads
coverage in 80% of the samples (16/20 samples) were included in the analysis (962,093 CpGs). DMC analysis was
performed using MethylKit. CpGs that had a multiple test corrected p-value (q-value) less than 0.05 and a change
in DNAm (∆DNAm) ≥ 5% were considered DMCs. Candidate gene promoter DMCs were identified as those that
overlap the genomic coordinates of the candidate gene promoters (defined as 10kb up-, 1kb downstream of the TSS).
B) A flow chart for the development of the candidate gene list. The 152 candidate genes were based on either 1)
genes with highly variable DNAm in the TCGA breast cancer cohort that involve inflammation or 2) literature
review for inflammation related DNAm processes, DNAm and fatty acids or breast cancer development. C) The
candidate genes (left bar) were enriched in DMCs when compared to all genes (right bar; hypergeometric test p-value
= 0.026). D) Genome-wide promoters and candidate gene promoters were enriched in hypermethylation after n-3
PUFA treatment. The hypergeometric test was used to compare the ratio of hyper- to hypo-methylated genes in all
tested gene promoters (left bar) to both the genome-wide promoter DMCs (** middle bar; p-value ≤ 0.001) and the
candidate gene promoters (* right bar; p-value = 0.018).

Figure 3: Directional Enrichment of DNAm Changes in Candidate Gene Associated Pathways
Inflammation-related pathways were determined using DMCs located in candidate gene promoter regions. A)
The hypergeometric test was used to compare the number of hyper- or hypomethylated DMCs observed in each
pathway to the distribution of DMCs in promoter regions genome-wide (7,129 hyper- and 3,174 hypomethylated
DMCs). Asterisks indicate hypergeometric FDR p-value ≤ 0.05. Daggers indicate that hypermethylated DMCs are
localized in biologically relevant region(s) of each pathway. Of the four pathways that were tested for directional
enrichment, three had significant overrepresentation of hypermethylated DMCs (FDR p-value ≤ 0.05; indicated by
stars). Two pathways were both enriched in DMCs and biologically relevant localization of DMCs. B) Comparison of
the promoter DMCs used to determine enrichment in the Focal Adhesion and TLR pathways shows the shared genes.
C) Comparison of all genes included in the Focal Adhesion and TLR pathways shows an overlap of 21 genes. The
shared genes represent two shared signaling cascades in both pathways.

Figure 4: n-3 PUFA Treatment Effects show High Variability Between Samples A) n-3 PUFA treatment
produces highly variable effects on genome-wide DNAm between participants in gene associated features. Participants
are labeled 1 through 10. The DNAm was averaged for each of the genomic features for each participant at 0 and 6
months of n-3 PUFA treatment. The change in DNAm from n-3 PUFA treatment (treated minus untreated) per
individual is shown. B) The change in global DNAm also showed variable treatment effects between women. The
average DNAm values from all CpGs with at least 5 reads coverage were used to determine global DNAm for each
participant at 0 and 6 months. C) Following n-3 PUFA treatment, the serum fatty acid profiles of all participants
showed increases in n-3 PUFAs and decreases in monounsaturated fatty acids. Following n-3 PUFA treatment,
participants differed in directional change of saturated fatty acids and n-6 PUFAs. For each fatty acid measure,
the change after n-3 PUFA treatment is shown (treated minus untreated) for each sample pair. D-E) Variable n-3
PUFA treatment effects at the CpG level were assessed in the Focal Adhesion and TLR pathways. For each study
participant, the number of hyper- and hypo-methylated CpGs were counted for each of the DMCs detected in the
two pathways. CpGs were counted only when the magnitude of the DNAm change was greater than 5% so that the
variability was not overrepresented by small changes. Based on the average effects, more hypermethylated CpGs
would be expected; however, several participants had PBMCs with a higher number of hypomethylated CpGs. In four
participants, PBMCs showed relatively more CpG hypomethylation than hypermethylation in at least one pathway at
6 months of n-3 PUFAs; for participants 2 and 3, there was greater CpG hypomethylation in both pathways.
