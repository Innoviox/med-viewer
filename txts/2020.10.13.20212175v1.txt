    Abstract
    Analysing infection and mortality data for COVID-19 as a function of days for 54 countries across
    all continents, we show that there is a simple scaling behaviour connecting these two quantities
    for any given nation when the data is segmented over few ranges of dates covering the most rapid
    spread of the pandemic and the recovery, wherever achieved. This scaling is described by two
    parameters, one representing a shift along the time axis and the other is a normalisation factor,
    providing a reliable definition of the mortality rate for each country in a given period. The number
    of segments for any country required in our analyses turns out to be surprisingly few with as many
    as 16 out of 54 countries being described by a single segment and no country requiring more than
    three segments. Estimates of the shift and mortality for these 54 countries in different periods
    show large spreads ranging over 0-16 days and 0.45-19.96%, respectively. Shift and mortality are
    found to be inversely correlated. Analyses of number of tests carried out for detecting COVID-19
    and the number of infections detected due to such tests suggest that an effective way to increase
    the shift, and therefore, decrease mortality, is to increase number of tests per infection detected.
    This points to the need of a dynamic management of testing that should accelerate with the rise
    of the pandemic; it also suggests a basis for adjusting variations in the testing patterns in different
    geographical locations within a given country.

           OVID-19 does not need an introduction; the pandemic has made that superfluous. Unar-
    C        guably, there is no other scientific term that has ever been more widely known to the world
    population. Naturally, this has led to an immense effort within the global scientific community
    to understand its possible nature, trajectory, consequences, remediation and treatments, leaving
    aside more contentious aspects like its probable origin, relative merits, based on their efficacies,
    of various national efforts, and the balancing acts between the management of the pandemic and
    the financial health. These efforts, as a consequence of the sense of urgency involved, have led to
    a proliferation of various analyses, speculations, hypothesis, and claims appearing in every form
    of communication available to us. With this background, we need to justify why we bring out
    this report when we seem to have a glut of information already swamping our sensitivities and
    sensibilities.
           It is believed that the number of people infected with COVID-19 is much larger than the
    number of affected people with a large proportion of infected ones remaining asymptomatic. Even
    among the group affected with perceptible symptoms, it is only a small fraction that develops
    serious health complications, including mortality in extreme cases. The presently known crisis
    faced by the humanity arises from this small fraction with the total number of infected or the
    number with milder symptoms being essentially ignored. It has even been said that the number
    of infected being large is in fact desirable in terms of attaining herd immunity quickly, as long as
    the mortality rate can be kept low. In absence of any viable treatment at present, the only way to
    control the mortality rate is through early detection and proper medical care and support, giving
    the body the best chance and the longest time to tackle the virus. While medical sciences grapple
    with the all-important issues of understanding various aspects pertaining to the interaction of the
    SARS-CoV-2 with the human system and drug and vaccine candidates at the biological levels, it is
    instructive to see if the vast amount of information available on the mortality rates from different
    countries provide us any generalisation despite the extreme diversity in national mortality rates. In
    fact, one may turn around this observation and ask the question that has often been asked about
    the origin of this tremendous spread of mortality rates between different nations. Understandably,
                                                                       2

    this is a complex question that is necessarily dependent on many factors, some possibly even
    unknown to us at present. So, we reduce the question to a more manageable one by asking if we
    can identify some of the factors that may have an influence on the mortality rate specifically and
    on the trajectory of this pandemic in general.
           The data that are readily available for analyses from most countries are the cumulative and
    daily numbers of infections detected and deaths registered related to this pandemic. However, there
    are considerable disparities and uncertainties related to the definitions applied by each nation to
    build up these databases. One specific and easily identifiable example of such uncertainties can
    be seen in terms of a sudden spike in the infection or death count that is evidently far beyond any
    statistical fluctuations, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a) for the daily death counts reported by India 1 with
    red dots. This arises from an attempt to correct daily death counts due to missing reports over a
                                                                                   2
    period by accounting for all such cases in a single day,                          giving rise to such an unreal spike in
    the death count for that single day. This naturally leads to a discontinuity in the cumulative death
    count on that particular day, as shown in Fig. 1(b) with red dots. In order to deal with this specific
    type of inaccurate data from vitiating the analysis, we distribute the excess count of deaths (or
    infections, as the case may be) on that particular day over each day of the preceding period in a
    way proportional to the already reported death (or infection) count of that day; this amounts to
    assuming that a fixed percentage of deaths (or infections) was uniformly missed each day leading
    to the total number of missed counts being corrected. We illustrate this procedure by applying it to
    data in Fig. 1(a) and (b) where the original data with the spike in the count appear as red dots and
    the derived data, with the count in the spike distributed over all preceding days proportionately, as
    open blue circles. Clearly, the two data sets for daily death counts are almost identical everywhere
    except for the unreal spike on the single day being absent in the resulting data set. Likewise, the
    two data sets for the cumulative number of deaths are essentially identical except in the vicinity of
    the anomalous day with the corrected data presenting a smooth interpolation of the discontinuous
    change in the original data set. Such corrections are required only for a limited number of cases,
    namely for China, South Africa, Chile, Portugal, Hungary, India, and USA.

    95 (16 Jun) and 131 (22 Jul) shown with red dots. The derived data after distributing the excess
    counts of these two days over the preceding periods, as discussed in the text, are shown with open

    corresponding to the spikes in the daily counts are shown together with the derived cumulative

                        While the above procedure appears reasonable for such recognisable anomalies in the death
    count, there are many other uncertainties in data reporting that are impossible to account for. Thus,
    any conclusion based on analyses of such uncertain databases must be robust against such diversi-
    ties of definitions and accounting of the numbers of infected and deaths. The hope is that analyses
    of extensive data from many nations will make the conclusions statistically useful in showing us
    underlying trends, if any exist. If the mortality would depend only on the virulence of the virus
    vis-á-vis the immunity level of the population of a nation, in absence of any well-established med-
    ical intervention, the mortality rate is fixed for the nation, independent of any national policy and
    measures to contain the infection, such efforts only influencing the spread and consequently, the
    number of infections and deaths, but not the ratio of the two that is defined as the mortality. An
    estimate of the mortality for any nation is easily obtained by taking the ratio of the total cumulative
    numbers of deaths and infections on any given date. This ratio is readily seen as the lower bound

    of the mortality, since on the date of the evaluation, there are a certain number of active infections
    with an inherent mortality rate that will increase the total number of deaths with time even if there
    is no other fresh infection detected.
           Since the detection of the infection generally precedes the event of a death in a patient, there
    is often a lag between the infection and the mortality in any given case of mortality that we call
    the shift, measuring simply the number of days between the detection and the death. While the
    mortality rate may not be affected by various national measures, as argued above, clearly this shift
    depends critically on such measures, for example a widespread testing program, leading to an early
    detection and enhancing the shift. While this shift is precisely definable for each case of mortality,
    a-priori, it is not obvious that there will be any recognisable measure of this shift for a nation, since
    in reality there are distributions of every relevant aspects controlling the infection/death correlation
    within any given nation, such as the stage of the detection, strategies of testing, virulence of the
    infection in individuals, definition and recording of the deaths due to COVID-19, immunity level
    of individuals, availability of the health-care system and other presently imponderable factors.
    Different geographical locations within a country may also have very different distributions of
    these aspects that are expected to have an impact on any statistical measure of the shift between
    the detection of the infection and the death. Even more important is to acknowledge that some of
    these factors even within any single nation may change with time as the society responds to the
    surging pandemic with various social, political, and medical interventions. Analysing the infection
    and mortality data from 54 countries seriously impacted by this pandemic across all continents, we
    surprisingly find that it is indeed possible to have well-defined values of Shifts (S) for every nation
    despite these variabilities. A consequence of this ability to estimate S reliably is that it allows us
    a more reliable estimate of the mortality rate (M ) with the identification of the relevant date of
    the infection to be related to the mortality on a certain date, with these two dates being separated
    by S in the national statistics. Not only we find large spreads in the obtained S and M across
    the countries analysed, there is clearly an inverse correlation between the two, despite our naı̈ve
    arguments earlier to suggest that M should not depend on any national measures. We note that the
                                                                       5

    knowledge of these two scaling parameters for a given country allows it to anticipate the demand
    on the health-care system from the measured number of infections on any given day, a longer shift
    giving the nation more time to respond and a lower mortality rate, of course, placing less demand
    on the system. Finally, we analyse the detection/test data of all these countries to show how S can
    be influenced for an effective management strategy.
           We illustrate the methodology of our analysis with the example of Switzerland, whose pro-
    gressive cumulative infection number is plotted using the left axis in Fig. 2(a) with red open circles
    against the Day Number with the Day Number = 1 being March 12, 2020; we have also marked
    the beginning and the middle of every month in the plot to give a better idea of the transition of
    calendar dates through the plot-period. In the same plot we have also shown the progressive cumu-
    lative number of deaths (black open circles) using the right axis over the same period. The relative
    scales of the left and the right y-axes have been adjusted to make the two plots appear normalised
    at the end point to make obvious the shift between the two plots along the time axis. Denoting
    the dependencies of the number of cumulative infections (Ni ) and cumulative deaths or mortality
    (Nm ) on the day number (nd ) as Ni (nd ) and Nm (nd ), we obtain values of two parameters, Factor
    (F ) and Shift (S), such that the scaled function,
                                                     Nf it (nd ) = F ∗ Nm (nd + S)                                                  (1)
    provides the best description of Ni (nd ) in the least-squared-error sense, making
                                               Ni (nd ) ∼ Nf it (nd ) = F ∗ Nm (nd + S)                                             (2)
    In other words, we find the shift, S, in the number of days and the corresponding multiplicative
    factor, F , that when applied to the cumulative mortality numbers give the best approximation to the
    observed cumulative number of infections. Since percentage mortality is defined as the number of
    deaths for every 100 infections, the factor, F , directly provides the mortality rate as 100/F and we
    report throughout this paper the number for the percentage mortality rate estimated via this method.
    In the specific case of Switzerland, this least-squared-error approach provides us with a shift and
    mortality rate of 11 days and 6.01% and the resulting scaled cumulative function, Nf it (nd ), is
                                                                       6

    for Switzerland as a function of the day with day 1 = March 12, 2020. The cumulative number of
    deaths shifted by 11 days and multiplied by the factor (16.64) is shown with blue dots to illustrate
    the scaling behaviour. (b) The number of daily infections and deaths over the same period as in

    multiplying by 16.64, as determined from the scaling of the cumulative numbers of infections and
    deaths in panel (a) leads to a good correspondence for the daily counts of these two quantities as
    well.
    shown with blue dots in Fig. 2(a); the comparison of the measured infection data, Ni (nd ), plotted
    with red open circles and the fitted or scaled data, Nf it (nd ), plotted with blue dots using the same
    common left axis makes it evident that this scaling works well for Switzerland with just a single
    value of Shift describing the entire period March 12-May 17, 2020 spanning more than two months
    that we analysed.
                                 We note that the incidence of infections and deaths in Switzerland beyond this period dropped
    to relatively small numbers, making it statistically insignificant. This is illustrated in Fig. 2(b)
    where we plot daily infections and deaths, in contrast to the corresponding cumulative numbers
    plotted in Fig. 2(a). In Fig. 2(b), the red open circles, referred to the left axis and representing
    the number of daily infections reported, do not appear to be in any obvious relationship with the
    black open circles, referred to the right axis and representing the number of daily deaths reported,

    in the main panel. However, when we use the same scaling factor and shift on the number of daily
    deaths, shown in blue dots in the inset to Fig. 2(b), and compare with the reported daily infections
    (in red), the correspondence becomes obvious, establishing the scaling behaviour extracted from
    the analysis of the cumulative numbers and illustrating our methodology of deriving the Shift (S)
    and the Factor (F ) for each country.
           We found that the above described approach works very well for 16 of the 54 countries that
    we analysed. For the remaining 38 countries, it proved impossible to find such a single scaling set
    to map the number of deaths on to the number of infections in the cumulative or the daily counts
    over the entire period under consideration. We illustrate this difficulty in Fig. 3(a) with the example
    of data available for Japan over the period March 5-May 30, 2020. The single segment analysis,
    successful for Switzerland (Fig. 2), was applied to the case of Japan and the least-squared-error
    procedure yielded Shift = 15 and Factor = 19.37. When the cumulative death number (black open
    circles) were scaled with this set of scaling parameters, it results in plot shown with blue dots as
    the best single-segment fit to the cumulative infections reported (red open circles), illustrating the
    failure of the single-segment analysis.
           This prompted us to carry out multi-segment analysis, increasing the number of segments
    systematically to provide a good description of the reported cumulative infection by the scaled
    cumulative death with the least number of segments. We found that the case of Japan required a
    minimum of three segments with each segment independently scaled via the least squared-error
    approach, to arrive at a good agreement between the reported data and the scaled plot, as shown in
    Fig. 3(b), where we have also marked the three segments with vertical dashed lines and indicated
    the Shift and the Factor for each segment. The consistency of the derived shifts and factors from
    this 3-segment analysis with the data of daily infections and deaths is illustrated in Fig. 3(c),
    where the main frame shows the plots of the daily infections (red open circles) and daily death
    counts (black open circles) with no evident similarities between the two. In the inset we show the
    scaled daily death counts (blue dots) in the three separate segments with the corresponding shifts
    and factors, as shown in Fig. 3(b), in comparison with the daily count of infections (red open

    Figure 3: (a) Cumulative number of infections (red open circles) and deaths (black open circles)
    for Japan as a function of the day with day 1 = March 5, 2020. The blue dots represent the
    single segment scaling (see text) with the optimal Shift = 15 and Factor = 19.37, providing a poor
    description of the measured cumulative infections (red open circles). (b) Same as in panel (a),
    but the scaling analysis is carried out in three segments as marked with independently determined
    optimal Shift and Factor for each segment. The three-segment scaled plot is shown with blue dots,
    exhibiting a good description of the measured cumulative infections (red open circles). (c) The
    number of daily infections and deaths over the same period as in panels (a) and (b). The inset
    shows the result (∆) of scaling the number of daily deaths (blue dots) in each of the three segments
    marked in panel (b) by optimal shifts and multiplying by optimal factors, as determined from the
    three-segment scaling of the cumulative numbers of infections and deaths in panel (b), leading to
    a good correspondence for the daily counts of the reported number of infections (red open circles)
    and the scaled daily deaths.

             Out of the 38 countries requiring such multi-segment analyses, 14 required 2-segment anal-
    yses and 24 required 3-segment analyses. We have summarised all necessary information against
    each of the 54 countries analysed by us in Table 1. This table also illustrates that even in such
    multi-segment analysis, it is possible to identify one specific segment as the dominant one with
    the maximum number of infections reported during that period. For example, in the case of Japan
    shown in Fig. 3, the three segments, defined by the date periods of March 5-March 30 (Seg-
    ment 1), April 1-April 25 (Segment 2), and May 5-May 30 (Segment 3), had 1622, 11053, and
    1726, respectively, reported cases of infections (see Table 1), clearly establishing Segment 2 as the
    dominant segment. We use this definition of a dominant segment for each country that requires a
    multi-segment analysis, the remaining segment(s) being termed as minor.
             As already mentioned, the calculated parameter, Factor (F ), is related to the mortality rate
    (M ), as M = 100/F ; these estimates of the mortality rates for all countries and different segments
    are shown in Table 1 in addition to the values of the Shift, S, and F . We note that another definition
    of the mortality rate for any given country can be the total number of deaths divided by the total
    number of infections on the last date included in our analysis; we already pointed out that this
    defines a lower bound of the mortality. We explore how the estimate of the mortality rate as 100/F
    relates to this lower bound of the mortality rate for various countries by plotting one against the
    other in Fig. 4. The diagonal dashed line is the 45o line, indicating the trajectory of data points if
    the presently defined %mortality (= 100/F ) is equal to the lower bound. Thus, one expects that
    all data points to be either on this dashed line or above it since there cannot be any %mortality
    lower than the bound. The red dots are for countries with single-segment analysis, showing a very
    good correlation with the lower %mortality bound. While the %mortality is found to be spread
        1
          It is to be noted that in all our analyses, each segment is treated independently with the assumption that the first
    date of the segment is the beginning of the infection; this is easily achieved by subtracting from the cumulative number
    of infections and deaths within the specific period under analysis the number of infections and deaths already reported
    prior to this period, but adding this number back for the purpose of plotting all segments together.
                                                                       10

    Figure 4: Plot of %Mortality estimated from the scaling analysis vs. the lower bound of %mortality
    estimated from the total numbers of mortality and infections for each country.
    over a wide range, from 1.86% for Thailand to 19.96% for France, all the red dots appear close
    to the dashed line, either being virtually on it or approaching it from above. Since, in the long
    run, %mortality must be equal to the lower bound, a sizable gap between the two for the period of
    analysis suggests that these countries are still far from reaching the end of the pandemic on the last
    date included in our analysis. Countries which have flattened the curve, as it is called, reaching the
    low incidence of infection and mortality by the end date of our analysis show that the %mortality
    estimated by the scaling is almost equal to the lower bound with the red dots of these countries
    appearing on the dashed line.

           We have also plotted M of the dominant segment for each country requiring a multi-segment
    analysis in Fig. 4 with a blue open circle. It should be noted that in this case, M is not limited
    by the lower bound, in contrast to the single segment analyses, since the lower bound refers to
    the data collected over, not only the dominant, but all segments. Thus, it is not surprising to find
    some of the %Mortality of the dominant segment being lower than the lower bound for a few of the
    countries; it suggests that the country did relatively well in keeping the mortality rate low during
    the incidence of the majority of the infections or alternately, had a high rate of %Mortality during
    the minority segment(s). The primary examples of this behaviour are UK, Iran, South Korea, USA,
    and Japan (see Fig. 4 and Table 1). The reverse case is found to be true for Sweden and Mexico
    with a high M for the dominant segment. In any case, a clear correlation between M and the lower
    bound of the mortality from the total deaths and infections is established by Fig. 4, suggesting the
    relevance of the parameter M obtained from our scaling analysis as a definition of the mortality
    rate for each country over the specified time interval (Table 1).
           The other parameter, Shift (S), measures the typical number of days between the detection
    of the infection and the occurrence of the mortality for a country during the time segment defined
    in Table 1. Interestingly, this scaling parameter also shows a huge variation between countries with
    its value ranging from 0 to 16. While different countries may have different protocols of register-
    ing the mortality date, making comparisons between countries somewhat difficult, it is clear that
    given any protocol for a country, larger the S is more time is available for the person to receive
    medical support and critical care, increasing the chances of survival. Therefore, it is reasonable
    to anticipate an inverse correlation between the shift (S) and the %mortality (M ) if other factors
    remain invariant. With this in mind, we have plotted the %Mortality (red dots and blue open cir-
    cles) vs. the Shift for every country in Fig. 5 using the results of the dominant segments (shown
    with blue open circles) for countries with multi-segment analysis. In a few cases, minor segments
    have comparable number of infections as in the dominant segment, making the identification of the
    dominant segment somewhat arbitrary for such countries. Specifically, we find that each of UK,
    USA, Russia, Senegal, and South Africa have a segment with the number of infections within 80%

    of that in the dominant segment of that country. We include results of analysis of such segments,
    referred to as significant-segments, shown with stars in Fig. 5. Evidently, Fig. 5 shows some
    interesting trends, being restricted to only certain regions (highlighted by the light green shade) of
    the Shift-%Mortality phase space. The highlighted region shows two distinct parts of the phase
    space being populated, one for the low %Mortality (6 3.0) region with a small slope suggesting
    relative insensitivity of the %Mortality on the Shift. Intriguingly, all developing countries, with
    the exception of Egypt, Romania and Mexico, appear in this part of the phase space. It is also in-
    teresting to find that almost all countries, except Egypt, with hot/warm weather with temperatures
    reaching beyond 30 C during the period under consideration appear in this group of low mor-
    talities and varying shifts. However, this group with low mortalities also includes Russia, South
    Africa, South Korea, Australia, and Austria with relatively colder climates during period being
    analysed here, suggesting that along with many other factors, the temperature may also be playing
    a significant role in controlling the mortality rate in a given nation. While the negligible inclina-
    tion of this shaded region encompassing the group with a low mortality rate ( 6 3%) suggesting
    %Mortality is not influenced significantly by the Shift, the highlighted region with a prominent
    inclination encompassing the remaining countries with %Mortality varying between ∼1 and 20
    and Shift varying between 3 and 15 defines a clear correlation between these two parameters with
    a rapidly decreasing mortality rate with an increasing shift.
           We note that for Denmark to belong together with all other European countries with its
    estimated mortality rate of ∼ 5%, its S parameter should be > 5 instead of being 0, as indicated
    by the dashed arrow in Fig. 5. While Denmark remains a distinct exception, discussed also later
    in the text, the remaining countries, including all other developed countries appearing in this range
    marked by the inclined region, lend credence to the hypothesis that a larger shift provides a distinct
    advantage in keeping down the mortality rate in any given scenario. Of course, the substantial
    variation in the mortality rate for any given shift, as obvious in Fig. 5, also indicates that the
    mortality rate is not only controlled by the single parameter, S, and that there must be several other
    factors that control the mortality rate. There are huge differences between different countries in
                                                                       13

    dots and blue open circles represent the countries with single-segment analysis and the dominant

    terms of the investment in the per capita health care system, there are also differences in defining
    what constitutes a COVID-19 related death between different countries, the accuracy of reporting is
    also not expected to be uniform across all nations. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that there
    is indeed dispersion in the mortality rate for a given value of the S parameter, but our analysis
    spanning 54 countries suggests that the Shift does have a strong influence on M , indicating that

    national efforts should be aimed at early detections of the infection, thereby giving a chance to
    control the mortality. A large value of the Shift will also help the nation to respond better to the
    anticipated demand on the health care facilities and equipment, as it gives more time to consolidate
    resources to any anticipated surges in demand for critical care equipment.
           The early detection of infection can only be achieved by increasing the number of tests
    being carried out in any country along with other social aspects of awareness and reporting habits
    of the general population. However, increasing the number of tests has many implications in
    terms of the financial burden, the effort of organising large-scale testing, and availability of testing
    infrastructures. Given the rapid surge of the pandemic, every country must optimise its testing
    protocol and the number of tests to be carried out. How does a country decide what number of
    tests is a reasonable number? In general, every country carries out testing of anyone with a certain
    level of symptoms, countries differing from each other in the definition of the eligibility in terms of
    the severity of these symptoms. Certain countries have active policies of contact tracing, covering
    primary and secondary contacts; in some of these countries, the testing may be extended to cover
    such contacts as well. The frequency or the definition of the test eligibility may also change with
    changing policies and strategies within a country based on the stage of the pandemic. At times,
    the number of tests is expressed in terms of number of tests per million of residents of the country.
    Since this number necessarily only grows with time, it cannot directly reflect the course of the
    pandemic. On the other hand, average number of infections confirmed per unit of tests, often
    expressed as a percentage, and termed the %Positive cases, is a useful indicator for marking the
    progress of the pandemic and also for any decision-making process. For example, an increase in the
    number of confirmed infections per 100 tests would indicate an acceleration of the pandemic and
    suggest the need to increase the number of tests further. Based on these considerations, we plot the
    Shifts, obtained from our scaling analysis, for all segments of all countries vs. the corresponding
    %Positive cases for that segment, wherever the test data are available in Fig. 6(a). This plot
    makes it clear that there is an inverse relationship between the Shift and the %Positive cases. This
    correlation suggests that an effective way to build in a large shift between the detection of the
                                                                       15

    infection and the mortality and consequently, reduce mortality itself (see Fig. 5), this being the
    primary concern of any society, is to monitor the number of infected cases per unit of tests carried
    out. Any acceleration of the pandemic will tend to an increase in the %Positive cases; our analysis
    suggests that, under such circumstances, the testing efforts in that group of population will have
    to be correspondingly increased in order to retain the same Shift value. This also allows one to
    rationalise the distribution of tests to be carried out across the nation in terms of local %Positive
    cases within the country as well as aiming at similar Shift and Factor that scale the mortality data
    on to the infection data, helping the available resources to be strategically utilised under optimal
    conditions.
                         Chile appears to have a slightly larger shift (12) than should be expected based on the cor-
    relation in Fig. 6(a). We note that a modest change of the Shift by 2 bringing it to 10, would
    have brought Chile within the shaded region as shown in the figure, suggesting that it may well be
    within the uncertainties discussed before. However, Denmark clearly stands out as an exception to
                                                                             16

    the correlation between Shift and %positive cases. Despite this anomaly, it is interesting to note
    that the lowest Shift that will be compatible with Denmark’s low %Positive cases is 5 as shown in
    Fig. 6(a) with a dashed arrow. This expected shift of at least 5 was also shown to be anticipated
    based on the ∼ 5% mortality rate of Denmark in connection with our discussion of Fig. 5 cor-
    relating Shift and Mortality. In this sense, Denmark shows an underlying compatibility between
    its relatively low mortality rate within European countries connected with its very small %Positive
    cases due to a large testing program despite an anomalously small Shift value, prompting one to
    wonder if the death reporting in Denmark follows a different protocol compared to other countries
    considered here.
           In summary, we have analysed the data pertaining to COVID-19 infections and deaths for
    54 countries over wide periods covering the most rapid spreads of the infection and recoveries,
    wherever achieved. With proper segmenting of the data into different date ranges, we show that
    the cumulative deaths and infections as a function of time can be mapped on to each other for
    any given country with a shift of one with respect to the other and a normalising factor; this is
    achieved with minimum segments for each country, with 16 countries requiring a single segment
    covering the entire time range, while the remaining ones required 2 (for 14 countries) and 3 (for
    24 countries) segments. The normalising factors provide reliable estimates of the mortality within
    the corresponding range of dates. These shifts and mortality rates are found to be spread over
    0-16 days and 0.45-19.96%, respectively, indicating wide variabilities between countries as well
    as across different segments of individual countries requiring multi-segment analysis. Correlation
    of these shifts and mortalities over all segments and countries show an inverse relationship, sug-
    gesting early detection is crucial in controlling the mortality rate. Analysing further the pattern of
    testing of the infection in different countries during different periods, we find that %Positive cases
    detected through such testing correlates inversely with shifts. These results help in anticipating the
    progression of the pandemic and therefore, help in managing the medical and other resources in
    controlling along with ways to influence the mortality rate.
                                                                       17
