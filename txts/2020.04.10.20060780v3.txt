                              BACKGROUND: Mortality rates are known to depend on the seasons
                          and, in temperate climates, rates are highest during winter. The magni-
                          tude of these seasonal fluctuations in mortality has decreased substantially
                          in many countries during the 20th century, but the extent to which this
                          decrease has contributed to the concurrent increase in life expectancy is
                          not known. Here, I describe how the seasonality of all-cause mortality
                          among people ages 60 years or more has changed in Sweden between 1860
                          and 1995, and investigate how this change has contributed to the increase
                          in life expectancy observed during the same time period.
                              METHODS: Yearly sex-specific birth cohorts consisting of all people
                          born in Sweden between 1800 and 1901 who reached at least 59 years of
                          age were obtained from a genealogical database. The mortality rates for
                          each cohort were modeled by an exponential function of age modulated
                          by a sinusoidal function of time of year. The potential impact of seasonal
                          fluctuations on life expectancy was investigated by a novel decomposition
                          of the total mortality rate into a seasonal part and a part independent
                          of the seasons. Cohort life expectancy at age 60 was used to quantify
                          changes in lifespan during the time period.
                              RESULTS: The magnitude of seasonal fluctuations in mortality rates
                          decreased substantially between 1860 and 1995. For cohorts born in 1800,

                          the risk of dying during the winter season was almost twice that of dying
                          during summer. For cohorts born in 1900, the relative increase in winter
                          mortality was 10%. Cohort life expectancy at age 60 increased by 4.3 years
                          for men and 6.8 years for women, and the decrease in seasonal mortality
                          fluctuations accounted for approximately 40% of this increase in average
                          lifespan.
                              CONTRIBUTION: By following a large number of extinct cohorts, it
                          was possible to show how the decrease in seasonal fluctuations in mortality
                          has contributed to an increase in life expectancy. The decomposition of
                          total mortality introduced here might be useful to better understand the
                          processes and mechanisms underlying the marked improvements in life
                          expectancy seen over the last 150 years.
                 1       Introduction
                 Mortality rates in humans depend on the seasons – in countries with temperate
                 climate the rate of dying is typically higher during winter months (e.g., Tabel-
                 lkommissionen, 1857; Rosenwaike, 1966; Healy, 2003; Davie et al., 2007; Rau,
                 2007; Fowler et al., 2015). Such seasonal fluctuations in mortality rates, with a
                 peak during winter, is seen for most major causes of death but the magnitude
                 varies between different causes. For example, mortality from cardiovascular
                 diseases show larger seasonal fluctuations than mortality from cancers (e.g.,
                 Rosenwaike, 1966; Näyhä, 1980; Reichert et al., 2004; Parks et al., 2018; Rau,
                 2018). Other causes of death, such as accidents and suicides, might have very
                 different dependencies on the seasons and have been reported to have higher
                 rates during the summer (e.g., Näyhä, 1980; Parks et al., 2018).
                      In cross-sectional data, the seasonal variation in mortality differs between
                 age groups and the winter peak in mortality is most pronounced among older
                 people (e.g., Näyhä, 1980; van Rossum et al., 2001; Feinstein, 2002; Rau, 2007;
                 Parks et al., 2018; Rau, 2018). For example, Parks and coworkers analyzed
                 all deaths occurring in the United States between 1980 and 2016 and found
                 that all-cause mortality was strongly dependent on the seasons in all age groups
                 above 55 years; in younger age groups, on the other hand, the dependence on
                 the seasons was weak or non-existent (Parks et al., 2018). This age-dependency
                 in the seasonal patterning of mortality is likely a consequence of causes of death
                 being differentially distributed by age. For example, accidents and injuries
                 (external causes) constitute a much larger fraction of deaths among younger
                 people. Indeed, 36% of all deaths in Sweden last year among people under age
                 55 were due to external causes, for deaths above 55 the corresponding fraction
                 was 3.9%.
                      The seasonal variability of mortality rates is likely caused by multiple, and
                 interacting, factors, the most prominent are infectious diseases of the respiratory
                 system and their consequences (e.g., Anderson and Le Riche, 1970; Reichert
                 et al., 2004), and direct and indirect effects of cold temperatures (e.g., Rogot
                 and Padgett, 1976; Kunst et al., 1993; Curriero et al., 2002; Anderson and Bell,
                 2009). The former cause might be harder to protect against (c.f. Simonsen et al.,
                 2007; Osterholm et al., 2012), but major improvements have been made during
                 the last one hundred and fifty years in the ability to safely protect against the
                 impacts of weather.
                      The magnitude and phase of seasonal mortality variations have not been
                                                                   2

                 constant over time (Rau, 2007). Indeed, in many countries there has been a
                 marked decrease in magnitude during the 20th century (Näyhä, 1980; Keatinge
                 et al., 1989; Kunst et al., 1991; Seretakis et al., 1997; Lerchl, 1998; Rau, 2007).
                 During the same time period, life expectancy has increased substantially in
                 most countries, but the extent to which the decrease in magnitude of seasonal
                 fluctuations has contributed to this increase is not known. The increase in life
                 expectancy at birth is a consequence of decreased mortality rates at all ages,
                 and even if infant and child mortality rates have decreased most, in relative
                 terms, the decrease in mortality rates at older ages has also contributed (e.g.,
                 Janssen et al., 2005; Statistics Sweden, 2020, Ch. 4).
                      The main aim of this paper is to investigate changes in seasonal fluctuations
                 in all-cause mortality between 1860 and 1995 among the elderly in Sweden,
                 and furthermore to estimate the impact these changes might have had on life
                 expectancy. The time period analyzed in this work was chosen to cover a period
                 during which mortality rates, and hence life expectancy, changed dramatically
                 in Sweden. The focus on changes in mortality among elderly (aged 60 years
                 or more) is motivated partly by that this group was likely more affected by
                 extraneous conditions such as the weather, and by previous research showing
                 that seasonality in this age group is present for many common causes of death
                 (e.g., Feinstein, 2002; Parks et al., 2018).
                      Seasonality of all-cause mortality is studied by following sex-specific annual
                 birth cohorts consisting of all people born in Sweden from 1800 to 1901 who
                 survived at least until age 59 (c:a 4.7 million people in total). Cohort mortality
                 rates are modeled by an exponentially increasing function of time with a super-
                 imposed one-year periodicity. The model allows the seasonality of each cohort
                 to be described by just two parameters, amplitude and phase, and changes in
                 seasonality are quantified by comparing the estimated amplitudes. The contri-
                 bution of seasonality to life expectancy is estimated by decomposing the total
                 mortality rate into two parts: A lower-bound mortality that increases exponen-
                 tially with age but does not vary with the seasons. This can be thought of
                 as the mortality rates that would prevail under the optimal conditions of late
                 summers. The other part of the decomposition, the seasonal mortality, depends
                 on the seasons but not on age.
                 2       Methods
                 2.1       Data
                 Mortality data for people who were born and died in Sweden were obtained
                 from the “Swedish Book of Deaths” issued by the The Federation of Swedish
                 Genealogical Societies (Sveriges Släktforskarförbund, 2017). This is a database
                 compiled from a range of official sources and contains information on times and
                 places of births and deaths for people that have died in Sweden since 1860.
                 The coverage is almost complete. Since there is no information about causes of
                 deaths in this database this study is based on all-cause mortality.
                      Birth cohorts were formed for all years between 1800 and 1901, for men
                 and women separately. The focus in this work is on all-cause mortality for
                 those who survived until the beginning of the year in which they would have
                 turned 60 years old, i.e., the they all survived at least until their 59th birthday.
                                                                   3

                 Since the database does not contain information about people who died before
                 1860, this age limit was needed in order to include birth cohorts from the entire
                 19th century. However, using a slightly different age limit, and thus a different
                 range of birth years, only led to minor changes in the results (not shown). In
                 total, there were almost 4.7 million people who fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
                 Supplementary table S1 lists the number of people in each cohort.
                 2.2       Follow-up time
                 To investigate how mortality rates vary with the seasons, follow-up should be
                 expressed in terms of calendar time. However, mortality rates also depend
                 (strongly) on age, and it is therefore necessary to first express age (for each
                 individual) in terms of calendar time.
                      Start of follow-up (i.e., time zero) was taken as the 1st of January the year
                 cohort members would have turned 60 years old, and follow-up time was mea-
                 sured in days. Since all members are (by construction of the cohorts) alive at
                 their 59th birthday, we can let the date of the 59th birthday be age zero. Let
                 bi denote the calendar day when cohort member i was born, expressed as the
                 number of days since the beginning of the year. For example, for someone born
                 the 13th of February, bi = 30 + 13 = 43. The age of cohort member i, in days
                 from time zero, ai (t), can then be expressed as a function of calendar time:
                 ai (t) = 365 − bi + t.
                 2.3       Model of mortality rates
                 Mortality rates for persons aged 60 years and above are often modeled by an
                 exponential function of age (e.g., Gompertz, 1825; Olshansky and Carnes, 1997),
                 and an exponential model has previously been shown to provide a good fit to
                 a subset of the data used here (Ledberg, 2020). To investigate how mortality
                 rates depend on the seasons, this exponential model was extended by including
                 a (1-year) periodic component. Thus, with follow-up time t expressed in days,
                 the mortality rates of persons born on day bi and belonging to cohort j, λj (t)
                 say, are assumed to obey:
                                            λj (t|bi ) = µj eβj (t+365−bi ) eαj cos( 365.25 +θj ) ,
                                                                                      2πt
                                                                                                             (1)
                 where µj > 0, βj > 0, αj ≥ 0, and θj are parameters that depend on the cohort
                 (i.e., on sex and birth year). Note that, according to this model, the effects
                 of the seasonal modulations, on a ratio scale, are assumed to be independent
                 of age. This is a useful first approximation suitable for the current study (see
                 Results), however, more complex models can easily be formulated within the
                 framework outlined herein.
                 2.3.1       Parameter estimation
                 To fit the model (Eq. 1) to data, an approximation related to the piecewise
                 exponential model (Laird and Olivier, 1981) was used. Assume that time is
                 measured in units of days, and consequently that t denotes the t-th day after
                 beginning of follow-up. Note that this discretization of time implies that the
                 mortality rate, λ(t), becomes piecewise constant. Let Nt denote the number of
                 persons alive at the beginning of day t and dt the number of persons who died

                 on this day.1 As long as λ(t) << 1, dt is well approximated by Poisson random
                 variable with expected value E(dt ) = λ(t)Nt . Taking logarithms on both sides,
                 using Eq. 1, and a well-known trigonometric identity for the cosine of the sum
                 of two angles gives
                                                                                                     

                 Since dt is approximately distributed as a Poisson random variable, the param-
                 eters of Eq. 2 (and hence of Eq. 1) can be estimated by Poisson regression using
                 existing software routines, for example the glm function in R. Thepamplitude α
                 and phase θ in Eq. 1 are obtained from the following relations α = a21 + a22 and
                 θ = arctan(−a1 /a2 ). In the supporting material it is shown that the parameter
                 estimates obtained using Eq. 2 differ only marginally from those obtained by a
                 direct maximization of the likelihood corresponding to Eq. 1. Estimation using
                 Eq. 2 is preferred because it is faster and can be done using existing software.

                      The model was fit to data for each birth cohort separately, starting from
                 the year where cohort members would have turned 60, and ending by the year
                 they would have turned 95. This upper-age restriction was imposed because
                 estimates of daily mortality rates are highly variable when Nt becomes small,
                 and consequently hard to fit with any model. This restriction led to that less
                 than two percent of all deaths in the database were censored.
                 2.4       Magnitude of seasonality
                 The magnitude of seasonality in a given cohort was quantified by fitting the
                 model to data from the cohort and using the predicted ratio of the highest
                 to lowest mortality rate in a given year. This can be interpreted as a risk
                 ratio, approximating how many times higher the risk is of dying in the winter
                 compared to dying in the summer. Note that according to the model (Eq. 1)
                 this magnitude is constant for a given birth cohort, and consequently, this single
                 number can be used to track how the magnitude of seasonality changed between
                 cohorts. The ratio in cohort j, hj say, is obtained from Eq. 1 as
                                                         hj = e2αj −182.625βj .                                (3)
                 Pointwise approximate confidence intervals for hj were obtained by first sam-
                 pling values of a1j , a2j and βj from a multivariate normal distribution with mean
                 and covariance matrix given by the fit of Eq. 2. These sampled parameters
                 were then transformed according to Eq. 3, and confidence intervals were esti-
                 mated from the empirical distribution so obtained. The normality assumption
                 in this procedure is warranted by the fact that maximum likelihood estimates
                 are asymptotically normal, and that the degrees of freedom in fitting the models
                 were moderately large.
                 2.5       Partitioning the mortality
                 In order to investigate the effect of the seasonal changes in mortality on cohort
                 life expectancy, Eq. 1 is recast in the following form (suppressing the dependency
                     1 Explicit reference to a particular cohort (index j above) is suppressed for clarity, but all
                 expressions are assumed cohort specific.

                                                                  def
                 t is partitioned into a first part, M1 = µ∗ eβ(t+365−bi ) , which is growing expo-
                 nentially with age and represents the lowest achievable mortality for a given
                 cohort. This part will be referred to as lower-bound mortality. The second part,
                       def
                 M2 = eα(1+cos( 365.25 +θ)) , depends on the seasons but not on age, and will be
                                          2πt
                 referred to as the seasonal part of total mortality. Since the cosine function is
                 bounded by ±1 it follows that M2 ≥ 1, and thus acts to increase the mortality
                 rate multiplicatively. Note that a change in mortality (between cohorts) can
                 come about through a change in M1 , M2 , or in both.
                 2.6       Contribution to mean length of life
                 Cohort mortality rates λ(t) and life expectancy are related through well-known
                 expressions, see for example Kalbfleisch & Prentice (Kalbfleisch and Prentice,
                 2002). The probability density of life times, f (t) say, is related to the mortality
                 rate by                                                Rt
                                                       f (t) = λ(t)e− 0 λ(x)dx .                             (5)
                 Note that time zero, in this work, was defined to be the first of January the year
                 when cohort members would have turned 60, so the above expression actually
                 represent a conditional density of life times. Mean life duration, conditional
                 upon reaching first of January of the 60th life-year, is then obtained as the
                 mean value of the corresponding distribution:
                                                                 Z ∞
                                                          e60 =        tf (t)dt.                             (6)
                                                                   0
                 The integrals in Eq. 5 and Eq. 6 do not, in general, have closed form solutions
                 and were therefore evaluated numerically.
                      Using the decomposition of Eq. 4 it is now possible to answer the follow-
                 ing counterfactual question: “what would cohort life expectancy have been if
                 mortality rates would have been given by the lower-bound mortality?” This is
                 accomplished by evaluating Eq. 6 for λ = M1 . The contribution of seasonality
                 can then be obtained by evaluating Eq. 6 with λ = M1 · M2 and taking the
                 difference between these estimates.
                 2.6.1       True average length of life
                 Since the cohorts are all extinct, life expectancy (conditioned on reaching any
                 particular age) is simply given by the average over the cohort members who
                 reached this age.
                 2.7       Visualization
                 To visualize seasonality in Figures 1 and 2, the time series of daily mortality
                 rates were smoothed by a running-line smoother of 60 days width (i.e., each
                 point is replaced by the local mean of the 60 surrounding points).

                  Figure 1 shows mortality rates for 20 of the cohorts. Several points are notice-
                  able: The periodicity of mortality rates is highly synchronized between men and
                  women, and its magnitude decreases substantially between cohorts born 1810
                  and 1900; women have lower mortality rates than men, in particular during
                  summer and early fall (the troughs); The mortality for both men and women
                  decrease between cohorts born in the beginning of the period and those born in
                  the end, and the decrease is more pronounced in the cohorts of women.

                  of men and women who were born and died in Sweden. Numbers in plots show
                  cohort birth years. Mortality rates shown are local averages over two month
                  (see methods). Data shown for ages between 60 and 90 years.
                      The annual peaks of mortality rates occur during winter (supporting Fig. S2)
                  and for cohorts born before 1875 the peak occurred during the second week of
                  February. The mortality peaks for cohorts born 1875-1901 occur somewhat
                  later, extending into March in some cases (supporting Fig S2). Note that this
                  implies, according to the model, that the troughs in mortality occurred during
                  late summer, in the middle to end of August.

                  3.2     A model of seasonality
                  Mortality rates were modeled by an exponentially increasing function of age
                  modulated by a sinusoidal term with constant amplitude and phase (Eq. 1).
                  Separate fits were made for each of the 202 cohorts (101 sex-specific birth co-
                  horts). The coefficients of the sinusoidal terms were highly significant in all
                  cohorts (F-test, all p-values < 0.001), indicating that the model with season-
                  ality better accounted for the data than did a model with just an exponential
                  increase with age.

                  and 1881 in the top panel). The phases of the seasonal fluctuations are almost
                  constant from year to year, but in some cases the mortality increase comes
                  earlier than predicted. For example, in 1919, in the middle panel, the peak
                  in mortality is earlier than in the model; the Spanish flu hit Sweden in early
                  October 1918 causing the peak to shift. Also, for ages above 90 years, mortality
                  rates become more variable, and are in some cases less well fit by the model
                  (e.g., the 1800 cohort).
                      Even if the model does not account for all aspects of the data it does pro-
                  vide a compact description of the main trends and provides a low-dimensional
                  summary that will be used below to track changes over time.
                  3.3     Changes in seasonality over time
                  To illustrate how the magnitude of seasonal variability in mortality has changed
                  over time, the mortality rate ratio (the ratio of the highest to lowest mortality
                  rate in any particular year, Eq. 3) is plotted as a function of cohort birth year
                  in Figure 3. According to the model (Eq. 1) this ratio is constant for a given
                  birth cohort. The magnitude of seasonal variability has decreased substantially
                  over the cohorts, both for men and women. For women born in the first decade
                  of the 19th century, the mortality rate was about two times higher in the winter
                  than in the summer. For women born 90 years later, the ratio had decreased to
                  about 1.1. Also noticeable is that for cohorts born before 1880, the magnitude
                  of seasonality was consistently higher among women than among men.

                 3.4       Contribution of seasonality to mean duration of life
                 To estimate how the decrease in seasonality might have influenced survival,
                 mortality rates were decomposed according to Eq. 4. Figure 4A illustrates this
                 decomposition for the cohort of women born 1800. The lower-bound mortality
                 (M1 in Eq. 4) is seen to provide a good approximation to what the mortality
                 rates would have been if the favorable conditions of late summer would have
                 prevailed throughout the year. Figure 4B,C and Tables S2 and S3 show that
                 the cohort life expectancy (conditional upon reaching 59 years of age) increased
                 substantially over the period: about 4.3 years for men and 6.8 years for women.
                 Note that the model fits almost perfectly predicts the life expectancy for these
                 cohorts. For the cohorts of men, Figure 4B and Table S2 show that the predicted
                 life expectancy corresponding to the lower-bound mortality increased from 76
                 years for the cohort born in 1800 to about 78 years for those born 1825, and
                 remained relatively constant in later-born cohorts, indicating that mortality
                 rates during late summer did not decrease further for these cohorts. Figure S3
                 provides an example of this phenomenon and shows that mortality rates for
                 the 1821 and 1881 cohorts often coincided in the late summers, but differed
                 markedly in winters. Figure 4C shows that the survival corresponding to the
                 lower-bound mortality for the cohorts of women increased only slightly over the
                 first 80 cohorts, but over cohorts born between 1880 and 1901 it increased with
                 almost three years.
                      The difference between the actual life expectancy and that predicted based
                 on the lower-bound mortality provides an estimate of the contribution of sea-
                 sonality and is shown in Figure 4D. The effect of seasonality was substantial
                 for cohorts born in the beginning of the 19th century; for women the seasonal
                 variability reduced life expectancy with about 3.5 years, in men by about 2.5.
                 The effect of seasonality first diminished gradually over cohorts, but remained
                 relatively constant at around −0.75 years for the last 20 cohorts. This patterns
                 reflects the corresponding decrease in the amplitude of seasonality seen in Fig. 3.
                 Of the total increase in mean life duration, 4.3 years in men and 6.8 in women,
                 this decomposition shows that about 40% of the increase is attributable to the
                 decrease of the magnitude of seasonal fluctuations.
                 4       Discussion
                 The magnitude of seasonal variations in all-cause mortality rates among elderly
                 in Sweden was shown to have decreased substantially in the cohorts followed
                 (Fig. 3). This is in line with previous results from other countries (Näyhä, 1980;
                 Lerchl, 1998; Kunst et al., 1991; Seretakis et al., 1997; Rau, 2007). Most of these
                 previous studies have focused on secular trends during the second half of the
                 20th century. The data used here made it possible to show that the decrease in
                 seasonality in Sweden started already with cohorts born during the first decades
                 of the 19th century.
                      By focusing on cohort data it was possible to quantify the extent to which
                 this reduction of seasonal excess mortality contributed to the increase in cohort
                 life expectancy observed during the time period. Cohort life expectancy at 60
                 increased by 4.3 years for men and 6.8 years for women, and about 40 percent
                 of this increase could be accounted for by the decrease in seasonality of death.

                 Below some possible causes of this decrease in seasonality are considered and
                 some technical aspects of the study are discussed.
                      It should be noted that mortality among younger people, including infants,
                 might also display seasonal variations, sometimes with a different phase com-
                 pared to older adults, e.g., a mortality peak in the summer (e.g., Rosenwaike,
                 1966; Näyhä, 1980; Knodel, 1983). It is likely that the mechanisms that drive
                 the seasonal fluctuations in younger people are different from those responsi-
                 ble for the fluctuations among older adults (c.f., Rau, 2007), and the extent to
                 which changes in the magnitude of seasonal variability in mortality among in-
                 fants and younger people have contributed to changes in life expectancy deserves
                 a separate investigation.
                 4.1       Interpretation of seasonal variation in mortality
                 Seasonal variability in mortality is a population phenomenon and it is of interest
                 to relate this phenomenon to processes at the individual level. In a recent model
                 of aging and death the exponential increase in mortality with age was shown
                 be a consequence of an accumulation of damage in the individuals (Ledberg,
                 2020). The rate of accumulation is controlled (in this model) by a damage rate,
                 modeling the amount of damage impinging on the individual, and the rate of
                 repair, i.e., the ability to fix the occurred damage. According to this model,
                 seasonal variability in mortality rates of the type seen here would result if the
                 rate of damage also varied with the seasons. For example, there are several
                 mechanisms through which a decrease in the ambient temperature can increase
                 physiological stress (e.g., Keatinge, 2002), and this might be conceptualized as
                 an increase in the rate of damage, supporting this interpretation. A more in-
                 depth investigation of the ability of this model of damage accumulation model
                 and death (Ledberg, 2020) to account for the results reported here is left for a
                 future contribution.
                 4.2       What might have caused the decrease in seasonality
                 In terms of calendar time, the main part of the decrease in seasonal variability
                 happened between 1870 and 1970, a time-period during which Sweden, as many
                 other countries, went through dramatic social and economical transformations
                 (e.g., Schön, 2010). In 1870 Sweden was a relatively poor country where most
                 people lived on the country side and where about 70% were working in agri-
                 culture and forestry. There was little or no public support for old and poor
                 people. In 1970 Sweden had become one the richest countries in the world, the
                 majority of the population lived in cities, less than 10% worked in agriculture,
                 and Sweden had a highly developed welfare system (e.g., Lundberg and Åmark,
                 2010; Schön, 2010). It is likely that at least part of the decrease in season-
                 ality was caused by the dramatic improvements in living conditions that were
                 part of this transformation of social and economical circumstances (c.f., Kunst
                 et al., 1991). The relative effect of seasonality was found to be approximately
                 constant within birth cohorts and this is an indication of that improvements
                 in living conditions, measured cross-sectionally, are more reflecting conditions
                 among younger generations than among older ones. However, more research is
                 needed to quantify the extent to which improved living conditions played a role
                 in quenching the seasonal variability in mortality.
                                                                   12

                      Another possible explanation of the decrease in seasonality is that the major
                 causes of death might have changed during the time period (c.f. Omran, 1971).
                 Clearly, a change from causes of death more sensitive to the seasons (e.g., respi-
                 ratory infections) to those less sensitive (e.g., cancers) could lead to a reduction
                 in seasonality similarly to the one observed. However, it is not clear to what
                 extent there has been such a transition in causes of death among older people in
                 Sweden. The system used to classify causes of death has changed multiple times
                 over the time period, and according to official records, less than 10 percent of
                 deaths among people 60 years or older were attributable to infectious diseases
                 already in 1911, a year with substantial seasonal variability. More research is
                 needed to determine to what extent the causes of death among older people in
                 Sweden have changed over this time period.
                 4.3       Differences between men and women
                 Figure 3 shows that for cohorts born during the first half of the 19th century
                 the seasonal variation in mortality was much more pronounced among women
                 than that among men. Close inspection of Fig. 1 shows that mortality rates
                 among cohorts of women were in general lower than among cohorts of men, and
                 that the difference in seasonality between sexes to a large extent is due to the
                 deeper troughs during the summer and early fall in cohorts of women. One
                 possible explanation of this increased difference in mortality rates during the
                 warm months is that men and women died from different causes. For example,
                 men were much more likely to die from drowning and suicide, two causes of
                 death that show a reverse seasonality and has a peak during the warm months.
                 A quantitative estimate of the extent to which differences in causes of deaths can
                 explain the differences in seasonality would require detailed information about
                 causes of death, something that unfortunately is not available at the national
                 level in Sweden before 1911.
                      Another striking difference between men and women concerns the develop-
                 ment of life expectancy at 60 is shown in Fig. 4. Among women, life expectancy
                 at 60 increased by 3.7 years between cohorts born 1875 and 1901 (Tab. S3). The
                 corresponding increase among men was 0.7 years. Note that this difference is
                 independent of seasonality which was of similar magnitude for men and women
                 during this time period (Fig. 3). The reason for why life expectancy did not
                 increase in men to the same extent might be attributed to sex differences in
                 tobacco smoking, as pointed out previously (Ledberg, 2020). Cigarette smoking
                 became widespread in Sweden during the 1940s and was to start with a pre-
                 dominately male behavior (Svenska Gallup Institutet AB, 1955; Socialstyrelsen,
                 1986). According to this explanation, life expectancy of men increased less
                 because primarily men were exposed to the deleterious health consequences of
                 smoking. Note that this explanation is consistent with there being no sex dif-
                 ferences in the magnitude of seasonality over the concerned time period; indeed
                 the main causes of death related to smoking are relatively independent of the
                 seasons. More research is needed to quantify the contribution of smoking and to
                 identify additional sources that can explain why women saw such an improve-
                 ment in life expectancy while men did not.

                 4.4       Cohort vs period effects
                 In this work, seasonal variations in mortality were assessed in a number of
                 extinct birth cohorts. Most previous work on seasonality has been based on
                 period data, and that might seem a more natural choice of data organization.
                 However, given that the magnitude of seasonality was found to be relatively
                 constant within cohorts, the cohort-based analysis provided a very succinct
                 description of the temporal trends (Fig. 3). A major advantage of using cohort
                 data is the possibility to directly compare the magnitude of seasonality to the
                 average life duration.
                      The model of mortality (Eq. 1) assumes a constant amplitude and phase of
                 seasonal variability in a given birth cohort. This model captured the main trends
                 in the data but it is clear that both the amplitude and phase of seasonality may
                 also depend on calendar year. For example, in years with more pronounced
                 outbreaks of influenza, both amplitudes and phases were affected in multiple
                 cohorts. A more comprehensive account of seasonality should include effects
                 of calendar years as well. However, introducing fixed effects of calendar years
                 in the model only had minor effects on the estimated decrease in seasonality
                 (not shown). For some cohorts, a model where the amplitude of the seasonal
                 effects was allowed to increase with time (i.e., an interaction) provided a better
                 fit to the data. However, the interaction effects were never very strong, and
                 it was judged that the model without interaction captured the magnitude of
                 seasonality well enough for the comparison across cohorts.
                      The magnitude of seasonal variations has been shown to increase with age
                 in some previous studies (e.g., Näyhä, 1980; Feinstein, 2002; Parks et al., 2018),
                 in the present study, however, the effects were shown to be relatively constant
                 with age (e.g., Fig. 2), and instead to change between birth cohorts. Given
                 that previous works were based on period data, these findings are in fact not
                 contradictory. Indeed, the cohort-dependent effects reported here would show
                 up as age-dependent effects in a period based analysis (as younger age groups
                 belong to later-born cohorts).
                 4.5       Effect of decreasing seasonality
                 To estimate how much the decrease in seasonality contributed to the increase
                 in average life duration, a comparison was made between the real cohort life ex-
                 pectancy, and the predicted life expectancy based on the lower-bound mortality.
                 This comparison showed that about 40% of the increase in life expectancy at 60
                 could be attributed to the decrease in seasonality. The interpretability of this es-
                 timate depends on that the decomposition of total mortality (Eq. 4) is sensible.
                 Close inspection of Fig 4 shows that the full model almost perfectly predicted
                 cohort life expectancy. Consequently, in terms of life expectancy, the decompo-
                 sition divided the observed data into two parts with very little left unaccounted
                 for. The data also gave support for that the two parts of the decomposition
                 could change independently of each other, further supporting the sensibility of
                 the decomposition. For example, in supporting Fig. S3 the mortality rates of
                 men born in 1821 are compared to rates of men born in 1881. This figure shows
                 that the differences in mortality rates between these two birth cohort are pri-
                 marily due to higher rates during winter seasons in the cohort born 1821. The
                 rates during summer seasons are similar in the two cohorts. In terms of life
                                                                   14

                 expectancy at 60, those born in 1821 on average lived to be 75.6 whereas those
                 born 1881 lived until 77.2 years. This difference is fully explained by the larger
                 seasonal variability in the first cohort. This example thus shows an increase in
                 life expectancy that was caused entirely by the quenching of the excess mortality
                 in winter seasons, providing additional support for the approach taken here.
                      Future work might explore in more detail the conditions that have enabled
                 an increased life expectancy among old people in Sweden. The results presented
                 here suggests that a substantial part of this increase might be due to that living
                 conditions in Sweden have become independent of the seasons. However, it is
                 also clear that the bulk part of the increase in life expectancy at 60 must be
                 attributed to factors that are relatively independent of the seasons.
                 5       Conclusions
                 By following a large number of extinct birth cohorts it was possible to show
                 how the decrease in seasonal fluctuations in mortality has contributed to the
                 increase in average life duration. The simple model of cohort mortality and
                 the decomposition of total mortality introduced here might be useful to better
                 understand the processes and mechanisms underlying the marked improvements
                 in life expectancy seen over the last 150 years.
