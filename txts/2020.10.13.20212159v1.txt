30       Abstract

31       Background: Achieving a stable joint is an important yet challenging part of total knee

32       arthroplasty (TKA). Neither manual manipulation of the knee nor instrumented sensors

33       biomechanically characterize knee laxity or objectively characterize how TKA changes the laxity

34       of an osteoarthritic (OA) knee. Therefore, the purposes of this study were: 1) objectively

35       characterize changes in knee laxity due to TKA, 2) objectively determine whether TKA resulted

36       in equal amounts of varus-valgus motion under a given load (i.e., balance) and 3) determine how

37       TKA knee laxity and balance differ from values seen in non-osteoarthritic knees.

38       Methods:Two surgeons used a custom navigation system and intra-operative device to record

39       varus-valgus motion under quantified loads in a cohort of 31 patients (34 knees ) undergoing

40       primary TKA. Similar data previously were collected from a cohort of 42 native cadaveric knees.

41       Results: Performing a TKA resulted in a “looser knee” on average, but great variability existed

42       within and between surgeons. Under the maximum applied moment, 20 knees were “looser” in the

43       varus-valgus direction, while 14 were “tighter”. Surgeon 1 generally “loosened” knees (OA laxity

44       6.1°±2.3°, TKA laxity 10.1°±3.6°), while Surgeon 2 did not substantially alter knee laxity (OA

45       laxity 8.2°±2.4°, TKA laxity 7.5°±3.3°). TKA resulted in balanced knees, and, while several

46       differences in laxity were observed between OA, TKA, and cadaveric knees, balance was only

47       different under the maximum load between OA and cadaveric knees.

48       Conclusions: Large variability exists within and between surgeons suggests in what is considered

49       acceptable laxity and balance of the TKA knee when it is assessed by only manual manipulation

50       of the leg. Knees were “balanced” yet displayed different amounts of motion under applied load.

51       Clinical Relevance: Our results suggest that current assessments of knee laxity may leave

52       different patients with biomechanically different knees. Objective intra-operative measurements

53       should inform surgical technique to ensure consistency across different patients.

57       Introduction

58                  The success of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) depends on many factors, but surgical

59       technique, including establishing a stable joint, has been identified as particularly critical.[1, 2]

60       Improper intra-operative management of soft tissues can lead to post-operative complications such

61       as instability, early loosening of the components, stiffness, limited range of motion, and excessive

62       polyethylene wear.[3, 4] However, debate exists regarding how much joint laxity is appropriate.

63       Some surgeons aim for a post-operative knee that is not too tight with a little varus-valgus laxity,

64       looser in flexion than in extension, and looser laterally (under varus stress) than medially.[5-7]

65       Similarly, patients have reported they prefer a lax knee compared to an over-tight knee.[8] Even

66       though healthy knees are reported to have asymmetric mediolateral laxity[9], many surgical

67       protocols advocate knees with equal amounts of varus-valgus laxity (i.e., a balanced knee).

68       Ultimately, an objective definition of what constitutes a clinically successful amount of joint laxity

69       does not exist.

70                  Multiple techniques are used to assess joint laxity during TKA, but each has notable

71       shortcomings. Many surgeons have become skilled at developing a “feel” for acceptable knee

72       laxity during manual manipulation of the leg, but this qualitative evaluation lacks objective

73       measurements and has unknown repeatability. Navigation systems have been used to measure

74       varus-valgus range-of-motion and measure tibiofemoral spacing at the time of surgery[10-16], but

75       the clinical benefit of navigation remains heavily debated. [11-14, 17, 18] Instrumented sensors

76       record tibiofemoral contact to determine the balance provided by the collateral ligaments, with

77       some studies suggesting that balanced intra-operative readings lead to improved clinical

78       outcomes[19, 20] and post-operative kinematics [21]. However, these tibiofemoral contact

79       readings are typically only recorded at one varus-valgus angle, and a variety of often conflicting

80       tibiofemoral force targets have been reported. [19, 20, 22-24]

81                  No current intra-operative approach to measuring knee laxity provides its historically

82       proposed biomechanical characterization, specifically                              “continuous recordings of force-

83       displacement and moment-rotation relationships”[25]. Previous studies have characterized knee

84       laxity this way in healthy subjects [26, 27], in intact cadaveric specimens[25, 28], and in cadaveric

85       specimens after TKA [29]. However, such objective measurements of TKA knee laxity have not

86       been conducted intraoperatively and could help determine what magnitudes of knee laxity and

87       balance best lead to improved post-operative function.

88                  We believe the ability to objectively characterize intra-operative knee laxity would

89       represent an improvement over the subjective or incomplete measurements currently made with

90       existing approaches. We previously created a novel device that interfaces with our custom surgical

91       navigation system to allow surgeons to quantify knee laxity [30]. In this study, we used those

92       custom tools to 1) objectively characterize changes in knee laxity due to TKA, 2) objectively

93       determine whether TKA resulted in equal amounts of varus-valgus motion under a given load (i.e.,

94       balance) and 3) determine how TKA knee laxity and balance differ from values seen in non-

95       osteoarthritic knees. As a secondary analysis, we investigated these intra-operative data between

96       two orthopaedic surgeons to assess the variability within and between surgeons.

97       Methods

98                  This study followed a protocol that was approved by the Institutional Review Board at The

99       Ohio State University, and all participants provided written informed consent. Increased surgical

100       time associated with our intra-operative measurements was limited to 20 minutes, and the surgeons

101       (Beal and Granger) could elect to stop testing at any time. In this manuscript, we are reporting on

102       a cohort of 31 participating patients (11 males, 20 females, average age 60.4±8.4 years) including

103       3 bilateral patients (all women) for a total of 34 knees (Beal: n=15, Granger: n=19), all with a pre-

104       operative varus deformity.

105                  We used an intra-operative measurement system comprised of a custom surgical navigation

106       and device to objectively measure knee laxity [30-32]. After exposing the knee with a standard

107       medial parapatellar arthrotomy, the surgeons placed threaded couplers in the tibia and femur to

108       rigidly hold an optical tracker in each bone and then established reference frames by digitizing

109       appropriate landmarks [33]. The laxity device was then placed on the table above the sterile drapes,

110       the modified boot was applied to the patient’s foot using Coban wrap (3M, St. Paul, MN), and the

111       boot was placed in the slider mechanism with the leg in full extension (Figure 1). To record laxity

112       data, the surgeon placed the instrumented handle in the slider (Figure 1B) and restrained the femur

113       by gripping the patient’s distal thigh with the knee in full extension. Without pre-conditioning the

114       knee, the surgeon then applied a varus-valgus load for 3 trials as the navigation system recorded

115       the resultant motion of the tibia, femur, boot, and slider and the instrumented handle measured the

116       input load applied by the surgeon.

117                  The surgeons were blinded to the intra-operative measurements and were entirely in control

118       of the amount of force applied to the patient. This approach, as apposed to prescribing a load that

119       needed to be achieved for all patients, more closely resembled current clinical practice and allowed

120       us to determine the range of laxity that was considered acceptable by our surgeons. Maximum

121       loads varied based upon what the surgeon felt was safe for each patient; the maximum varus

122       moment ranged from 0.3-35.2 N·m, and the maximum valgus moment ranged from 3.6-34.9 N·m.

123                  Following testing on the osteoarthritic knee, surgeons then performed a TKA with a

124       Zimmer NexGen LPS flex knee (Warsaw, IN) with similar surigical techniques. They both sought

125       to approximate a neutral mechanical axis of the leg by making a valgus cut to the distal femur and

126       a perpendicular cut to the proximal tibia. In the sagittal plane, cuts were designed to match the J-

127       curve of the femur and establish a posterior slope on the tibia. The femoral component was

128       rotationally aligned parallel to the transeipcondylar axis, while the tibial component was aligned

129       to the medial third of the tubercle. Minimal soft tissue release was performed following bone cuts,

130       although release of the deep medial collateral ligament off of the edge of the tibia is part of the

131       initial surgical exposure. After the implants were cemented in the knee, the patient’s leg was put

132       in the device, and varus-valgus data were taken again using the same procedure as before.

133                  Intra-operative data were used to characterize knee laxity by plotting the moment applied

134       to the leg versus the displacement ( in degrees) for each pre- and post-implant trial (Figure 2). A

135       third-order polynomial was fit to the raw data for each trial of alternating varus/valgus load. Each

136       patient’s overall varus/valgus laxity was determined from the average of these three trials (Figure

137       3). The neutral position of the leg was established to be the varus/valgus angle of the knee under

138       no load, even if this this angle was not 0°. We defined varus/valgus laxity as the amount of

139       varus/valgus displacement from the neutral position that occurs under a given varus/valgus load .

140       While applied moments of different values have previously been used to assess knee laxity [34-

141       37], we analyzed laxity data at 2 different levels: 1) a 7.5 N·m varus/valgus moment [37, 38]

142       (±7.5N·m laxity) and 2) the maximum varus/valgus moment applied to the limb (max varus/valgus

143       laxity). We also investigated laxity in only one direction under both the 7.5 N·m and maximum

144       applied loads (e.g., varus 7.5 N·m laxity) For the two knees that did not experience at least one

145       trial of a ±7.5 N·m moment, only their maximum moment was calculated.

146                  A dataset of “normal” joint laxity was estaslished from similar measurements in 42

147       cadaveric specimens that were part of ongoing research in our laboratory (20 from female donors,

148       average age 69.0 ± 14.9 years, age range: 27-87 years). These cadaveric knees had observed levels

149       of OA of “none” or “mild” as determined by participating orthopaedic surgeons. While cadavers

150       cannot be considered a perfect representation of “normal” anatomy, the need to drill trackers into

151       the bones with the intra-operative device renders it inappropriate for use in healthy volunteers.

152                  We employed several statistical analyses. In order to characterize the change in knee laxity

153       from the pre-operative osteoarthritic knee to the knee after TKA and to determine whether the

154       individual surgeons affected post-operative laxity, a general linear model ANOVA was used to

155       test for significance of surgeon, OA/TKA knee condition, and the surgeon*OA/TKA interaction

156       effect. Upon seeing a significant interection effect in the ANOVA, we analyzed magnitudes of

157       OA/TKA laxity on each patient for each surgeon using the paired t-test. One-sample t-tests were

158       used to test for differences in mediolateral balance in the postoperative (TKA) knees by comparing

159       the difference in varus and valgus laxity to “0”, which would suggest a “perfectly balanced” knee

160       with equal amounts of varus/valgus laxity. Two sample t-tests were used to test for differences in

161       the magnitudes of laxity and balance between surgeons. Separate two sample t-tests with

162       Bonferroni corrections were used to compare both intraoperative OA and TKA knee laxity data

163       with corresponding data from the cohort of native cadaveric knees.

171       Results

172       Objectively characterize changes in knee laxity due to TKA

173                  Performing a TKA resulted, on average, in a “looser” knee in the varus-valgus direction,

174       (Tables 1-4). However, there was great variability in the results. Seventeen knees were “looser” in

175       the varus-valgus direction after TKA compared to before TKA, while 15 were “tighter” with a

176       ±7.5 N·m applied load. Under the maximum applied moment, twenty knees were “looser”, while

177       14 were “tighter”.

178                  The manner in which TKA laxity was achieved differed by surgeon, as indicated by the

179       significant surgeon x OA/TKA interaction effect (Tables 1-3, Figure 4). For example, under the

180       ±7.5 N·m varus-valgus applied load, Surgeon 1 “tightened” knees by as much as 1.9° and

181       “loosened” knees by as much as 5.8°, while Surgeon 2 “tightened” knees by as much as 6.7° and

182       “loosened” them by as much as 5.4°(Figure 4). Under the maximum applied load, Surgeon 1

183       “tightened” knees by as much as 4.0° and “loosened” knees by as much as 9.5°, while Surgeon 2

184       “tightened” knees by as much as 2.8° and “loosened” knees by as much as 5.0°

185       Objectively determine whether TKA resulted in a balanced knee

186                  The knees recorded in the operating room were balanced post-operatively on average, with

187       no differences seen between varus and valgus laxity at 7.5 N·m (0.16° ± 1.88° varus bias) (p =

188       0.629) or at the maximum applied moment (0.03° ± 3.05° varus bias) (p = 0.941). There were no

189       differences in balance between surgeons at either 7.5 N·m (Table 2) or the maximum applied loads

190       (Table 3)

192       Compare measurements of TKA laxity against values from cadaveric knees.

193                   Several significant differences were seen between the intraoperative measurements and

194       the “control” data from the cadaveric specimens (Table 4, Figure 5). Under a ±7.5 Nm load, varus

195       laxity, valgus laxity, and varus-valgus laxity in both the OA and TKA knees were different from

196       the cadaveric specimens. However, at this load, there was no difference in balance between either

197       the OA knees (0.28° ± 1.27° valgus bias) or TKA knees (0.16° ± 1.88° varus bias) and the

198       cadaveric knees (0.25° ± 0.66° varus bias). Under the maximum applied load, we observed many

199       of the same differences in the laxity parameters between the OA or TKA knees and the cadaveric

200       specimens. Only two comparisons were not statistically different: the maximum varus between the

201       OA and cadaveric knees and the balance between the TKA and cadaveric knees.

202

203       Discussion

204                  We believe this study represents the first objective characterization of intra-operative knee

205       laxity and balance in response to a measured applied load before and after TKA, whereas other

206       approaches can only be used after some bone cuts have been performed. Further, data suggest that

207       even balanced knees can have different amounts of knee laxity.

208                  Our results generally agree with and build upon previous research into knee laxity. We

209       previously demonstrated that TKA results in greater knee laxity in cadavers with PS implants [29]

210       and in patients the operating room in response to an unmeasured load[39]. Our data from the

211       cadavers in the present study are similar to other laxity data in cadavers[25] and human

212       subjects[40] and support the conclusion that knees with osteoarthritis are more lax than healthy

213       controls[41]. However, our finding of a biomechanically balanced knee contrasts other work whic

214       found unbalanced (i.e., asymmetric) knees in full extension measured with stress radiographs [9].

215                  This study raises an interesting question as to how post-operative laxity is established with

216       TKA. Even though, on average, the varus-valgus laxity and balance for the TKA knees were

217       similar between the 2 surgeons and was looser than the OA knees, Surgeon 1 tended to “loosen” a

218       cohort of patients with “tighter” knees, while Surgeon 2 did not appreciably alter varus-valgus

219       laxity. Both surgeons loosened and tightened knees within their respective cohorts, even though

220       they had similar approaches to the operation. Thus, it remains unknown whether our results are

221       due to the desire of both surgeons to leave the knees in a similar state post-operatively or whether

222       our results would be changed if the surgeons were presented with a different cohort of patients and

223       they continued their general approach of either loosening or not altering laxity.

224                  Similar to how navigation systems have been used to document the variability with

225       component alignment [42], our data suggest that large variability exists in what is considered

226       acceptable laxity and balance of the TKA knee when it is assessed by only manual manipulation.

227       The varus/valgus loads applied to some patients were almost 10 times the loads that were applied

228       to others. With post-implant ±7.5 N·m varus-valgus laxity varying from 1.0° to 11.8°, maximum

229       varus-valgus laxity varying from 1.4° to 17.2°, and magnitudes of balance varying by over 11°, it

230       is clear that even though all patients received the same implant, the overall state of their knees

231       were greatly different from each other. It is important to question whether such variability is

232       clinically meaningful. Previous studies have found statistically significant differences in varus-

233       valgus laxity of 1.5° when measured at 20° of knee flexion between OA patients and healthy older

234       control subjects[41] , have used a threshold of 4° as the difference between “tight” and “slack”

235       TKA knees when measured at 30° of knee flexion[43], and have a threshold of 6° to deduct points

236       from the Knee Society Score with the knee is in full extension after TKA [44]. Given this

237       variability in the TKA knees, the initial variability of the pre-operative (OA) knees seen by the

238       surgeons, as well as how different surgeons affected knee laxity, personalized approaches to

239       performing a TKA that involve objective measurements of surgical technique may be warranted

240       to ensure consistent post-operative outcomes.

241                  This study is not without limitations. We only tested 34 knees with similar pre-operative

242       deformities, all of whom underwent TKA by the same two surgeons, and using the same implant

243       tested in full extension. Different surgeons using a different surgical approach (such as the so-

244       called “kinematic alignment” approach[45]), different implants (different manufacturer, cruciate

245       retaining designs or medially stabilized implants [46, 47] ), a different cohort of patients (e.g.,

246       valgus deformity), would demonstrate different results. Additionally, knees in this initial cohort

247       were only tested in full-extension due the learning curve associated with the time recording these

248       measurements; testing at different flexion angles would yield different results. Despite these

249       limitations, we believe that this initial study demonstates a more objective and comprehensive

250       characterization of intra-operative joint laxity than has historically been possible.

251                  In conclusion, we have demonstrated that while knees following TKA had equal amounts

252       of varus-valgus motion under load (i.e., was “balanced”), “normal” joint laxity is not achieved and

253       the OA (pre-operative) laxity conditions of the joint may not be retained. It is unknown if TKA

254       should attempt to restore the pre-operative condition of the joint, should establish “biomechanical

255       balance,” should establish the “normal” non-OA knee laxity conditions, or leave the knee in

256       another condition. Future work should relate objective definitions of the biomechanics of the knee

257       to clinical outcomes in order to improve patient satisfaction and post-operative functionality.
