  43      Abstract (250 words max)
  44      Background: The insulin/insulin-like signalling (IIS) pathways, including Insulin-like Growth Factors
  45      (IGFs), varies with age. However, their association with late-life cognition and neuroimaging
  46      parameters is not well characterised.
  47      Methods: Using data from the British 1946 birth cohort we investigated associations of IGF-I, -II and
  48      IGFBP-3 (measured at 53 and 60-64 years) with cognitive performance (word learning test (WLT)
  49      and visual letter search (VLS) – at 60-64y and 69y) and cognitive state (Addenbrooke’s Cognitive
  50      Exam-III (ACE-III) - at 69-71y), and in a proportion, quantified neuroimaging measures (whole brain
  51      volume (WBV); white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV); hippocampal volume (HV)).
  52      Regression models included adjustments for demographic, lifestyle and health factors.
  53      Results: Higher IGF-I and IGF-II at 53y was associated with higher ACE-III scores (ß 0.07 95%CI
  54      [0.02,0.12]; score ACE-III 89.48 [88.86,90.1], respectively). IGF-II at age 53y was additionally associated
  55      with higher WLT scores (scoreWLT 20 [19.35,20.65]). IGFBP-3 at 60-64y was associated with
  56      favourable VLS score at 60-64y and 69y (ß 0.07 [0.01,0.12]; ß 0.07 [0.02,0.12], respectively), higher
  57      memory and cognitive state at 69y (ß 0.07 [0.01,0.12]; ß 0.07 [0.01,0.13], respectively) and reduced
  58      WMHV (ß -0.1, [-0.21,-0.00]). IGF-I/IGFBP-3 at 60-64y was associated with slower VLS scores at 69y
  59      (ß -0.08, [-0.15,-0.02]).
  60      Conclusions: Increased measure in IIS parameters (IGF-I, -II and IGFBP-3) relate to better cognitive
  61      state in later life. Furthermore, there were apparent associations with specific cognitive domains
  62      (IGF-II relating to memory; IGFBP-3 to memory, processing speed and WMHV; and IGF-I/IGFBP-3
  63      molar ratio with slower processing speed). IGFs and IGFBP-3 are associated with favourable cognitive
  64      function outcomes.

  66      Introduction
  67                The Growth Hormone/Insulin-like Growth Factor signalling pathway is thought to play a key
  68      role in ageing health and the determination of age-related diseases. In humans, this pathway is
  69      regulated through the somatotropic axis, which consists mainly of growth hormone (GH), Insulin-like
  70      Growth Factors (IGF) and their respective binding proteins (1). IGF-I binds to IGF binding proteins
  71      (IGFBP) in high-affinity complexes to prevent degradation and binding to the IGF-I receptor (IGF1R),
  72      thus leaving concentrations of ‘free’ circulating IGF-I relatively low. As such, the ratio of IGF-I to
  73      binding proteins provides an indication of bioavailability (1–3), whilst also mediating its effect via
  74      IGF1R; IGF-II bioavailability is also regulated by the IGF2 receptor (4). IGFBP-3, however, has also
  75      been shown to have IGF-independent associations on phenotypes(5).
  76                            Whereas research supports an important role of Insulin/Insulin-like Signalling (IIS) in
  77      early brain development and neuroplasticity, as evidenced by developmental defects associated
  78      with mutations in the IGF1R gene, its role in the maintenance of brain function is less well
  79      understood (6,7). Observational studies are conflicting, with some reporting protective, detrimental,
  80      ‘U’ shape and null associations (8,9). The relationship between IGF-II and cognition and neurological
  81      health, on the other hand, remains largely uncharacterised, with only one study to date, which
  82      reported raised IGF-II concentrations in association with better cognition, while no association of
  83      IGF-I was observed (10)
  84                The MRC National Survey for Health and Development (NSHD; also known as the 1946
  85      British Birth Cohort), provides an ideal opportunity to study the relationship between measures of
  86      the IIS axis through mid-life, and cognition and brain volume in later life (11). IGF-I and -II collection
  87      at multiple time points may help resolve previous discrepant findings by considering differential
  88      associations of age, and duration of follow-up. Additionally the NSHD has a wealth of data across the
  89      life-course, allowing us to control for potential confounders which have been omitted or based on
                                                                                                                                4

  90      recalled data in past studies, such as early-life cognition and historical affective symptoms. Finally,
  91      neuroimaging data enables associations with brain volume and neurovascular health to be studied in
  92      tandem with cognitive function.
  93                We aimed to examine associations of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and IGF-II measured at ages 53 and 60-
  94      64 with cognitive function at ages 60-64 and 69, and volumetric and cerebrovascular neuroimaging
  95      parameters (total brain, hippocampal and white matter hyperintensity volumes) at age 69-71.

  99      Methods
 100      Study participants
 101                The NSHD recruited 5,362 participants born within one week in March 1946 in England,
 102      Scotland and Wales. The cohort has remained in continuous follow-up from birth to date, with 24
 103      sweeps of investigation (12). Cognitive function at age 69 was our primary outcome. At this age,
 104      2149 participants were interviewed. Loss to follow-up was due to death (19.1%), refusal (20.6%),
 105      emigration or being temporarily abroad (10.8%) or because the participant could not be contacted
 106      or traced (7.8%). Figure 1 outlines the number of participants with information concerning exposure
 107      and outcome variables and the final sample (n=1762) used for analysis.
 108                We additionally examined associations with neuroimaging outcomes in a sub-sample who
 109      had participated in the neuroimaging sub-study, Insight 46(13). Details have previously been
 110      published (13), but in brief this study included 502 individuals who underwent positron emission
 111      tomography–magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI) scanning using a single Biograph mMR 3T PET-
 112      MRI scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen), with simultaneous acquisition of PET/MRI data,
 113      including volumetric (1.1 mm isotropic) T1 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)
 114      sequences(13). Volumetric T1-weighted and FLAIR images underwent visual quality control prior to
 115      processing following an automated pipeline(13). Relevant imaging measures were isolated as
 116      follows: total brain volume (TBV) using Multi-Atlas Propagation and Segmentation(14), mean
 117      hippocampal volume (HV) using Similarity and Truth Estimation for Propagated Segmentations(15),
 118      total intracranial volume (TIV) using SPM12 (Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging) and white
 119      matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) using Bayesian model selection (BaMoS)(16,17). WMHV was
 120      isolated from 3D T1 and FLAIR images followed by visual inspection to generate a global WMHV,
 121      including subcortical gray matter but excluding infratentorial regions(17,18). Eligibility criteria, the
 122      study protocol, and a comparison of those who did and who did not participate in Insight 46 have
                                                                                                                                6

 123      been described in detail elsewhere (13,18). Of the 502 Insight 46 participants, complete
 124      neuroimaging and ACE-III data were available for 378.
 125      Measures
 126      IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3 measurements
 127
 128                Blood samples were collected at age 53 (non-fasting), and age 60-64 (fasting). IGF-I, IGF-II
 129      and IGFBP-3 concentrations were obtained by radioimmunoassay using standard protocols in the
 130      same laboratory. The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) for IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3 were 3.4%,
 131      2.8% and 3.9%, respectively. The inter-assay CV was 13.7%, 7.4% and 11.7% for IGF-I, IGF-II and
 132      IGFBP-3, respectively (19). IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3 values were converted from ng/ml to standard SI
 133      units: nmol/L (20,21). IGF-I/IGFBP-3 values were calculated as molar ratios as an indicator of IGF-I
 134      bioavailability.
 135
 136      Cognitive performance measures
 137
 138                Three separate tests were used to measure cognitive domains. At 60-64 and 69,
 139      standardised versions of a Word Learning Test (WLT) and Visual Letter Search test (VLS) were used
 140      to assess memory and processing speed, respectively. The WLT consists of a 15-word learning task
 141      devised for the NSHD. Each word was shown to the participant for 2 seconds and partcipants were
 142      asked to immediately write down as many words as they could remember. The task was repeated
 143      three times, and the scores were summed (max = 45), which is representative of short-term episodic
 144      memory (22,23). The VLS required participants to scan for the letters ‘P’ and ‘W’ among other letters
 145      and cross out as many of these letters within one minute. Search speed score was based on how far
 146      the participant got in the grid search, with a maximum score of 600 signifying they had completed
 147      the whole grid (22).
                                                                                                                                7

 148                The Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III) is a test for cognitive state
 149      administered at age 69 (24,25). The test assesses five domains, each with different score ranges:
 150      Attention (0-18), memory (0-26), Fluency (0-14), Language (0-26) and Visuospatial (0-16). The test
 151      was administered either online using an iPad (http://www.acemobile.org/) or by paper if the former
 152      was not possible. Paper tests were scored by trained personnel (24,26). Unlike most tests of
 153      cognitive state, the ACE-III total score (max = 100) has a quasi-normal distribution, making it
 154      appropriate for parametric statistical analyses.
 155      Covariates
 156
 157                Covariates were selected a priori, based on previous studies and added into our models
 158      successively. Model 1 had sex, Model 2 included additional adjustments for childhood cognition and
 159      educational attainment, Model 3 added smoking status at the time of exposure and Model 4 added
 160      affective symptoms at the time of outcome (10,27,28). The same models were used when
 161      investigating the relationship between exposures and brain volume with TIV additionally controlled
 162      for in all volumetric outcome models.
 163                 Childhood cognition at age 8 was assessed by four tests administered by trained observers:
 164      reading comprehension, word pronunciation, vocabulary and non-verbal reasoning. Total scores
 165      were standardised to the study population. Lifetime education attainment was based on the highest
 166      educational qualification by the age of 43 years (26) and categorised as 1) no qualification or
 167      vocational qualifications 2) ordinary, advanced secondary and 3) tertiary qualifications. Smoking
 168      status was obtained from questionnaires and classified into current smoker, ex-smoker and never
 169      smoker at age 53 and 60-64 (29). Affective symptoms were self-reported at ages 60-64 and 69 years
 170      using the 28-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) (30). A threshold, set at the
 171      recommended 4 (non case) / 5 (case) cut was imposed on the GHQ-28 total score to determine case-
 172      level symptoms (30,31).
                                                                                                                                8

 174                WMHV was loge-transformed to account for skewness. ANOVA tests were used to examine
 175      exposure and outcome variable differences at different timepoints. Within the selected sample,
 176      missing data ranged from 0.1% to 27.9% for affective case symptoms (age 69) and IGF-I/IGFBP-3
 177      molar ratio (age 60-64) respectively. To minimise data loss, missing data for exposure, WLT, VLS and
 178      covariate variables were imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE).
 179      Imputation models included all model variables, except for volumetric outcomes. Datasets were
 180      imputed 20 times using a Bayesian linear regression model(32).
 181                Linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between exposure and
 182      outcomes. Results are presented as standardised beta values with 95% confidence intervals. To
 183      determine whether the associations of IGFs and IGFBP-3 with cognition and brain volume differed by
 184      sex, which may warrant stratification, an interaction term for sex was tested at the 10% significance
 185      level for all exposures. No interaction was found between sex and exposure variables, so main
 186      models were not stratified by sex. In addition, a quadratic term for the exposure was tested to
 187      explore the possibility of non-linear associations. A quadratic relationship was observed between
 188      IGF-II and general cognitive state and visual memory. Therefore, for associations with cognitive
 189      function, IGF-II measurements were categorised into tertiles.
 190                All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.5.2(33). Multiple imputation was
 191      performed using the ‘mice’ package in R(32). Relevant R script is available upon request.

 197      years, SD: 0.67) included 378 of these 1762 NSHD participants. Of these, 194 (51%) were male and
 198      184 (49%) female (Table 1).
 199                In the entire cohort at age 60-64, pattern shows that IGF-I concentrations were lower, and
 200      IGFBP3 levels substantially lower than at age 53 (Table 1). As a result, bioavailable IGF (IGF1/IGFBP3
 201      ratio) was higher at age 60-64 than 53. IGF-II concentrations were lower at age 60-64 than age 53.
 202      Visual memory (WLT) and processing speed (VLS) were lower with increasing age at investigation, as
 203      previously described (Table 1)(34).
 204       IGF-I
 205                Higher IGF-I measures at age 53 and 60-64 were associated with better cognitive function
 206      for the WLT and ACE-III cognitive measures, but not for the VLS (Figure 2). These associations
 207      reached conventional levels of statistical significance for IGF-I at age 53 and ACE-III at age 69 (ß 0.07,
 208      95% CI 0.02,0.12, p = 0.008). Adjustment for childhood cognition and educational attainment
 209      attenuated this estimate to ß 0.04, 95% CI 0.00,0.09, p = 0.063. Further adjustment for smoking
 210      status and emotional symptoms did not alter the estimate (Figure 2).
 211                In the subjects with imaging available, higher concentrations of IGF-I at age 60-64 were
 212      directionally associated with a 8% lower WMHV at age 71 years (95% CI -19%, 3%, p = 0.142), yet did
 213      not reach conventional levels of significance. Adjustment for the covariates did not affect this trend
 214      (Figure 4).
 215      Bioavailable IGF-I
 216
 217                Bioavailable IGF-I was associated with lower VLS and ACE-III scores (Figure 2). Elevated IGF-
 218      I/IGFBP-3 concentrations at age 60-64 were associated with slower VLS at age 69 (ß -0.08, 95% CI -
 219      0.15,-0.02, p = 0.019) (Figure 2). In contrast to IGF-I models, adjustment for childhood cognition and
 220      education did not attenuate effect sizes. No clear associations with brain volume were observed
 221      (Figure 4).
                                                                                                                              10

 222      IGFBP-3
 223                Higher concentrations of IGFBP-3 at age 60-64 were associated with faster processing speed
 224      at age 60-64 and 69 (ß 0.07, 95% CI 0.01,0.12, p = 0.014 and ß 0.07, 95% CI 0.02,0.12, p = 0.012,
 225      respectively) (Figure 2). The addition of covariates did not affect this association (Figure 2). Higher
 226      concentrations of IGFBP-3 at age 60-64 were additionally associated with higher scores for memory
 227      and cognitive state at age 69 (ß 0.07, 95% CI 0.01,0.12, p = 0.017 and ß 0.07, 95% CI 0.01,0.13, p =
 228      0.033, respectively) (Figure 2). Adjustment for education and childhood cognition attenuated these
 229      estimates to ß 0.05, 95% CI 0:00,0.10, p = 0.034 and ß 0.05, 95% CI 0:00,0.10, p = 0.07, respectively
 230      (Figure 2).
 231                Higher concentrations of IGFBP-3 at age 60-64 were additionally associated with a 10%
 232      lower WMHV at age 71 years (ß -0.1, 95% CI -0.21,0.00, p = 0.059). Adjustment for the covariates did
 233      not affect this association.
 234      IGF-II
 235                Similarly to IGF-I, higher concentrations of IGF-II were associated with better cognitive
 236      function for the WLT and ACE-III cognitive measures, but not with VLS (Figure 3). At age 53, the
 237      lowest tertile of circulating IGF-II concentration was associated with a lower ACE-III score at age 69
 238      (score ACE-III 89.48, 95% CI 88.86,90.1, p = 0.022, tertile 1) (Figure 3). Similarly, lowest tertiles of IGF-II
 239      at age 53 were associated with lower memory at age 69 (scoreWLT 20, 95% CI 19.35,20.65, p = 0.085,
 240      tertile 1). As for bioavailable IGF-I, no associations with brain volume were observed (Figure 4).

 243      Discussion
 244                In this UK population sample, IGF-I and –II concentrations at age 53, and IGF-I
 245      concentrations at age 60-64, were positively associated with cognitive state at age 69, assessed by
 246      the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination (ACE-III) and verbal memory, but not with processing
 247      speed. Higher IGFBP-3 concentrations at age 60-64 were associated with overall higher cognition.
 248      Adjustment for childhood cognition and educational attainment attenuated associations, but did not
 249      wholly account for them. In addition, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 at age 60-64 were associated with lower
 250      white matter hyperintensity burden at age 69-71. Multivariable adjustment did not notably alter
 251      these associations. Surprisingly, there was a trend towards worse cognitive state and processing
 252      speed in those with higher IGF-I/IGFBP-3 ratio levels.
 253                The positive relationship between IGF-I and general cognitive state reflects findings in the
 254      Nurses Health Cohort (NHC), which found an association between IGF-I and verbal memory
 255      attenuated after adjustment for educational attainment (35). NHC participants were of similar age to
                                             nd
 256      NSHD participants at our 2            baseline (60-64) years, and main follow-up point (69 years). Additionally
 257      though, we suggest associations are similar in men and women, and show that cognitive
 258      performance is related to IGF-I sampled earlier in life, at age 53. Our findings conflict with
 259      observation of a an adverse(36), or ‘U’ shaped relation(37), of IGF-I on cognition. The former
 260      analyses were performed cross-sectionally in much older participants (≥95 years), while the latter
 261      spanned ages 48-88 at follow-up. Age dependent pleiotropic effects of IGF-I could potentially
 262      account these conflicting findings; specifically, if IGF-I acts beneficially in middle age and early older
 263      age, but has adverse effects in late older age. A ‘U’ shaped association may therefore be observed if
 264      participants span early and late older age.
 265                           IGF-I plays an essential role in brain development and homeostasis, including
 266      neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation and angiogenesis (8,38). Prospective analyses of the
 267      Framingham Heart Study found that higher concentrations of IGF-I were associated with larger brain
                                                                                                                              12

 268      volumes in healthy participants, potentially suggestive of some protection against
 269      neurodegeneration (39). Association magnitudes were doubled in the parent versus the offspring
 270      cohort   (mean ages 79 years and 61 years, respectively), again highlighting an important age
 271      dependency. Whilst we did not observe an association between IGF-I and TBV, IGF-I was associated
 272      with lower WMHV, an indicator of cerebral small vessel damage. To our knowledge, no previous
 273      study has explored the association between IGF-I and cerebral small vessel disease. A 10-year
 274      prospective study found stroke incidence to be associated with lower circulating IGF-I
 275      concentrations (40). Other studies have shown improved outcomes following ischemic stroke in
 276      participants with higher IGF-I concentrations (41). In hypertensive mice, liver-specific IGF-I-
 277      knockdown treatment was associated with increased and earlier incidence of cerebral
 278      microhaemorrhages, as compared to control mice, likely due to impaired remodelling processes(42).
 279      Mechanisms underlying protective effects of IGF-I on the vasculature include anti-inflammatory
 280      properties, preservation of endothelial function, and a positive association with cardiovascular risk
 281      factors such as obesity and insulin resistance (40). Whilst our findings did not reach conventional
 282      levels of statistical significance, effect sizes, consistency with previous research, and strong biological
 283      plausibility supports further investigation.
 284                Surprisingly, however, associations with bioavailable IGF-I (i.e. IGF-I/IGFBP-3 ratio) were
 285      opposite to those observed for IGF-I alone, with the ratio associated with reduced processing speed
 286      and, to a lesser degree, cognitive state. This can be explained by IGFBP- 3 being positively associated
 287      with cognition independently of IGF-I, and that the age-related decline in IGFBP-3 was markedly
 288      greater than that for IGF-I . IGFBPs have been shown to execute IGF-I independent actions, including
 289      mediation of cell proliferation, apoptosis and survival (43,44). We observed globally improved
 290      cognitive outcomes associated with increased circulating IGFBP-3 concentrations. In line with our
 291      results, higher concentrations of IGFBP-3 were found to be cross-sectionally associated with better
 292      cognitive state in women in the Mayo Clinic Study of Ageing and reduced dementia incidence in
 293      men(45,46). In mice, null mutations in the Igfbp3 gene resulted in impaired neuronal structure and
                                                                                                                              13

 294      signalling and spatial working memory (47). However, findings are not consistent across studies with
 295      higher concentrations of IGFBP-3 related to poorer cognition in males in the Caerphilly Prospective
 296      Study (CaPS) (10).        Our findings highlight the importance of exploring associations with individual
 297      factors that form a biologically meaningful molecular ratios, and understanding age-related changes
 298      in exposures, which, as we show, may not be equivalent across associated measures.
 299                In addition to favourable cognitive outcomes, IGFBP-3 was conjointly associated with a 10%
 300      reduction in WMHV in our study. Several studies have implied the possibility of a beneficial
 301      association between IGFBP-3 and cerebral small vessel disease. High concentrations of circulating
 302      IGFBP-3 are associated with reduced risk of ischaemic stoke and improved functional outcomes
 303      following stroke events(41,48,49). In mice, IGFBP-3 was shown to protect retinal vasculature from
 304      hyperoxia-induced vessel regression and, in vitro, promoted differentiation of endothelial precursor
 305      cells to endothelial cells, indicating a potential pathway by which IGFBP-3 may reduce WMHV (5,50).
 306                Few studies have examined the relationship between IGF-II and cognitive outcomes. IGF-II
 307      has traditionally been seen as relatively unimportant beyond fetal development. However, there is
 308      increasing evidence relating detrimental IGF-II expression to disease after birth (4,51). To our
 309      knowledge, only one other study has investigated the role of IGF-II on later-life cognition. The CaPS
 310      found a reduced occurrence of cognitive impairment without dementia with higher circulating IGF-II
 311      concentrations, but not with cognitive state. In addition, they did not find an association between
 312      IGF-I and cognitive function (10). In our study, we found a time-dependent association between
 313      higher IGF-II at age 53 and better visual memory and cognitive state at age 69, presenting similarities
 314      to the results obtained from the IGF-I models. This suggests a common pathway, likely via signalling
 315      downstream of the IGF-1R. Discrepancies between our findings and those from the CaPS may be
 316      driven by choice of outcome. The CaPS studied CIND, dementia and ‘normal’ cognitive ageing
 317      separately, therefore excluding participants with CIND or dementia from models studying ‘normal’
 318      cognitive ageing. It is possible that ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’ cognitive ageing are driven by separate
                                                                                                                              14

 319      mechanisms and IGF-I and IGF-II might be protective in the context of ‘abnormal’ cognitive ageing
 320      only.
 321                Our study has some important strengths, including a prospective design with long follow-up
 322      (16 years) and important confounders, including childhood cognition. To our knowledge, it is the
 323      only study to use repeat exposure and outcome measures to better understand the temporal
 324      relationship between IGFs and cognition. Age-dependent relationships may reflect separate
 325      underlying biological pathways acting at different points in the life course. In addition, it is the first
 326      study to investigate both cognitive function and structural brain measures. However, it is important
 327      to consider some limitations of the present study. To investigate bioavailable IGF-I, this study used
 328      the ratio of IGF-I to IGFBP-3. However, binding proteins have been shown to have IGF-I independent
 329      actions  (43).   Conflicting results between IGF-I and bioavailable IGF-I in our study were seemingly
 330      explained by IGF-I-independent associations between IGFBP-3 and cognition, thereby supporting
 331      future study of IGFBP-3 independently from IGF-I. However, the use of ‘free’ IGF-I may provide a
 332      more accurate view of the role of unbound circulating IGF-I on brain health(52). Finally, with the
 333      latest follow-up at age 69, participants are still not old enough for severe cognitive decline to be
 334      common, which may have limited statistical power to detect moderate to small associations.
 335                In light of these findings, we would suggest further studies to determine the exact domains
 336      which may be affected by IGF-I, –II and IGFBP-3 concentrations. This could be done by using an array
 337      of cognitive tests that probe distinct cognitive domains. Further studies continuing to use repeat IGF
 338      and IGFBP exposure and cognition measures across the life course may help provide a better
 339      understanding of the complex relationship between the two. Reexamination of the relationships in
 340      the NSHD at an older age would be essential to understand age-dependent effects and potentially
 341      address the current inconsistencies in the field. Furthermore, genetic approaches to study the
 342      association between polygenic risk scores and cognition across the age spectrum may provide an
 343      alternate method to investigate relationships across the life course.

 344                While repeat measures in our study have highlighted the importance of time of exposure,
 345      outcome and follow-up period, further work is required to disentangle the temporal nature of the
 346      IIS-brain health relationship. Regular IGF-I, -II, IGFBP-3 and cognition measures throughout the life
 347      course would help to elucidate this. As autocrine and paracrine IGF-I concentrations vary with age,
 348      narrowing the age range at each sample collection could also prove essential(53,54). The wide age
 349      range in a number of studies may prove responsible for some of the heterogeneity currently
 350      observed in results (37,52,55).
 351                In conclusion, in this UK birth cohort, higher circulating IGF-I and -II levels were prospectively
 352      associated with favourable cognitive state, whilest IGF-I/IGFBP-3 ratio was associated with slower
 353      processing speed. IGF-II was additionally associated with better memory performance. IGFBP-3 was
 354      indepependently associated with cognitive state, memory, processing speed and WMHV. The
 355      present study has not only added to our understanding of the IIS-cognition relationship, but
 356      crucially, it has elucidated the importance of using a breadth of neuroimaging, cognitive function
 357      and state to understand more holistically how IGFs and IGFBPs relate to brain health from mid to
 358      later life.

 577      Figure 3:
 578      Predicted scores and 95% confidence intervals for the effect of IGF-II tertiles at ages 53y and 60-64y
 579      on ACE-III, WLT and VLS predicted score, in sex-adjusted and fully adjusted models (sex, early life
 580      cognition, lifetime education, smoking and depressive symptoms). Tertile 2 presents the reference
 581      category used in the regression. Abbreviations: Insulin-Growth Factor-I (IGF-I), Insulin-Growth Factor
 582      Binding Protein-3 (IGFBP-3), Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Exam-III (ACE-III), Word Learning Test (WLT),

 585      Figure 4:
 586      Beta coefficient and 95% confidence interval for the effect of IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 at
 587      ages 53y and 60-64y on Total Brain Volume (TBV), White Matter Hyperintensity volume (WMHV) and
 588      Mean Hippocampal Volume (MHV) at age 69y in the Insight 46 sub-study. Models were adjusted for
 589      sex and age at scan (base model), sex, early life cognition and lifetime education (+ childhood
 590      cognition and education model), sex, age at scan, early life cognition, lifetime education and smoking
 591      (+ lifestyle factors) and sex, age at scan, early life cognition, lifetime education, smoking and
 592      depressive symptoms (+depressive symptoms).
