47    Abstract
48
49    Studies of adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 include characterisation of lethal,
50    severe and mild cases1-8. Understanding how long immunity lasts in people who
51    have had mild or asymptomatic infection is crucial. Healthcare worker (HCW) cohorts
52    exposed to and infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of the pandemic
53    are an invaluable resource to study this question9-14. The UK COVIDsortium is a
54    longitudinal, London hospital HCW cohort, followed from the time of UK lockdown9,10
55    ; weekly PCR, serology and symptom diaries allowed capture of asymptomatic
56    infection around the time of onset, so duration of immunity could be tracked. Here,
57    we conduct a cross-sectional, case-control, sub-study of 136 HCW at 16-18 weeks
58    after UK lockdown, with 76 having had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 mild or
59    asymptomatic infection. Neutralising antibodies (nAb) were present in 90% of
60    infected HCW sampled after the first wave; titres, likely to correlate with functional
61    protection, were present in 66% at 16-18 weeks. T cell responses tended to be lower
62    in asymptomatic infected HCW than those reporting case-definition symptoms of
63    COVID-19, while nAb titres were maintained irrespective of symptoms. T cell and
64    antibody responses were discordant. HCW lacking nAb also showed undetectable T
65    cells to Spike protein but had T cells of other specificities. Our findings suggest that
66    the majority of HCW with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection carry nAb
67    complemented by multi-specific T cell responses for at least 4 months after mild or
68    asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

 69    The majority of people infected by SARS-CoV-2 have not been hospitalised and lack
 70    PCR confirmation of infection. A key concern is the extent to which immunity in mild
 71    or asymptomatic cases may confer protection from future infection6,15-18. The UK
 72    COVIDsortium recruited a cohort of 731 HCW at three London hospitals early in the
 73    pandemic at the time of UK lockdown (23rd March 2020)9,10. HCW underwent
 74    longitudinal follow-up including weekly nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2
 75    PCR, serum collection for antibody analysis and a self-reporting health
 76    questionnaire. 21.5% had laboratory confirmed infection and all were asymptomatic
 77    or had mild disease. We conducted a cross-sectional case-controlled sub-study
 78    (n=136) to analyse T cell and nAb immunity at 16-18 weeks after UK lockdown
 79    (Extended Data Table 1a). We collected samples from 76 HCW with laboratory-
 80    defined evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 60 HCW matched for age, gender
 81    and ethnicity that were consistently SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative and serology
 82    negative. Here, we set out to investigate whether asymptomatic or mild infection with
 83    SARS-CoV-2 would confer specific nAb and T cell responses lasting beyond 4
 84    months.
 85
 86    SARS-CoV-2 multi-specific T cell response
 87    A number of T cell studies investigating SARS-CoV-2 infection have described the
 88    presence of Th1 immunity7. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 T cell frequencies by IFNγ-
 89    ELISpot using three complementary approaches: whole protein1, mapped epitope
 90    peptide (MEP) pools4, and overlapping peptide (OLP) pools3 (Extended Data Table
 91    2a, b). The use of whole protein allows assessment of CD4 T cell responses to
 92    naturally processed epitopes, whereas the MEP and OLP pools assessed a
 93    combination of CD4 and CD8 T cell responses directed against defined
 94    immunogenic regions and unbiased coverage of key viral proteins, respectively.
 95
 96    Analysing T cell responses to Spike and Nucleoprotein (NP) protein in HCW with
 97    mild or asymptomatic, laboratory confirmed infection, only 49% responded to Spike
 98    whereas significantly more (85%) responded to NP, showing a wide range of
 99    frequencies (Fig. 1a). Using MEP pools containing previously mapped immunogenic
100    regions and offering good coverage for regional HLA genotypes4, responses of >80
101    SFC/106 PBMC were found in 69% to peptide pools for Spike, NP, Membrane (M)

102    and open reading frame (ORF)3a/7a, with the latter being at a significantly lower
103    frequency. Eighty-seven percent of HCW had detectable T cell responses to these
104    MEP pools (Fig. 1b). A third T cell stimulation platform used OLP pools spanning the
105    whole of NP, M, and ORF3a, together with 15mers spanning immunogenic regions
106    of Spike (Extended Data Fig. 1a); using this approach, we assessed multi-specificity
107    and cumulative SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell frequencies. This indicated a wide range
108    of cumulative T cell response frequencies, from zero to >1000 SFC/106 PBMC, with
109    86% showing a detectable T cell response (Fig. 1c). Of note with both the MEP and
110    OLP platforms, responses to ORF3a/7a or ORF3a respectively were significantly
111    lower than other antigens (Fig. 1b; Extended Data Fig. 1a). Although T cell
112    responses to individual regions were relatively weak, their cumulative frequencies
113    across all pools tested were similar in magnitude to that of T cells directed against a
114    pool of well-described CD8 epitopes from influenza, EBV and CMV assessed in
115    parallel in the same donors (Extended Data Fig. 1a), and comparable to frequencies
116    found against SARS-CoV-1 pools following SARS infection19
117
118    Responses to Spike, NP protein and Spike, NP and M MEP were significantly higher
119    frequency in HCW with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection than those in the
120    matched group without laboratory evidence of infection (Fig.1d, Extended Data Fig.
121    1, c-d). For example, 85% and 49% of HCW with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2
122    had T cell responses to NP and Spike protein respectively, compared with 29% and
123    12% of SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative and S1 IgG negative HCW (p<0.0001) (Fig.1d).
124    T cell recognition of these stimuli in HCW without evidence of infection, irrespective
125    of reported COVID-19-like symptoms, was similar to that seen in pre-COVID-19
126    pandemic controls (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 1c, d; Extended Data Table 1a, b).
127    The OLP pools (utilising increased cell numbers) showed detectable T cell
128    responses in the PCR negative, S1 IgG negative HCW group (Extended Data Fig.
129    1b). With every T cell stimulation approach tested, responses were also seen in a
130    proportion of pre-pandemic controls. Epitope mapping studies will be required to
131    investigate possible cross-reactive components of these responses with other
132    human coronaviruses as other studies have highlighted2,3,20 and to assess the
133    impact of any such cross-reactivity on disease outcome, whether positive or
134    negative21,22.

135    In addition to IFNγ SFC, we explored other cytokines indicative of non-Th1 subset
136    polarisation by screening supernatants from Spike and NP protein-stimulated
137    ELISpots; they showed no evidence of IL-4, 5, 13, 17 or 23 (Extended Data Fig. 1e).
138
139    In line with previous observations of SARS-CoV-2 T cells and ageing23, T cell
140    responses in HCW (n=75) with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 correlated with
141    age. There was a correlation with increasing age and T cell responses against Spike
142    MEP2, NP1 OLP and ORF3a/7a MEP (Extended Data Fig. 2a-d). Broken down by
143    age and gender, T cell immunity to Spike increased with age in males (Spike protein;
144    r=0.522, p=0.006) (Extended Data Fig. 2e). We found no differences in T cell
145    responses associated with ethnicity (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). T cell immunity to M
146    MEP, ORF3a/7a MEP and ORF3a OLP was higher in males compared to females
147    (Extended data Fig. 3c,d).
148
149    Neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at 16-18 weeks
150    The majority of HCW in this cohort with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
151    had detectable S1 IgG and/or NP IgG/IgM (97%) during follow-up. Peak antibody
152    level during 16-18 week follow-up (Fig2a) was considered to be a useful marker of
153    humoral immune activation in each HCW. Some studies of nAb responses in severe,
154    mild and asymptomatic disease have highlighted rapid waning of nAb within weeks14-
       16, 24
155           , with others finding a more sustained neutralising response25-27. We analysed
156    the nAb response in HCW at 16-18 weeks after UK lockdown and found that 90%
157    could neutralise pseudotype virus. There was a range of nAb titres detectable, with
158    66% having an IC50 titre of >200 (Fig. 2b-c), a correlate of protection in SARS-CoV-
159    2 based on viral challenge in macaque studies28. Ten percent of HCW with
160    laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated no detectable neutralising
161    response (Fig. 2b-c). Typical nAb profiles in the high (IC50 ≥200), low (IC50 50-199)
162    and none (IC50 ≤49) categories are shown (Extended Data, Fig 4a). The nAb
163    response positively correlated with peak S1 IgG and peak NP IgG/IgM (Fig. 2d).
164    Peak S1 IgG tended to be lower in those reporting non-case defining symptoms and
165    those who were asymptomatic compared to those with case-definition symptoms
166    (Fig. 2e). However, the nAb IC50 titre at 16-18 weeks after lockdown was maintained
167    at a similar level across these three symptom groups (Fig. 2f). Eighty-eight percent

168    of HCW aged ≥50y developed nAb at an IC50 of >200 compared with 59% of
169    younger HCW aged 24-49y; p=0.041 (Fig. 2g). Peak S1 IgG Ab and nAb IC50
170    increased with age in females (Fig 2h). We looked in more detail at comparative
171    features of infected individuals in the HCW cohort who did or did not show a nAb
172    response at 16-18 weeks (Extended Data, Fig. 4b-d); we cannot discount the
173    possibility that these individuals may have shown an earlier response that had
174    waned by 16-18 weeks. These 7 HCW with no nAbs spanned an age-range of 26-
175    53y and tended to be at the lower end of the HCW age-range. Although this sub-
176    study was not powered to investigate stratified demographic differences, we looked
177    at features such as gender, ethnicity, clinical role or location, use of personal
178    protective equipment (PPE) or symptom profile and found no difference between
179    those that made nAb and those that did not, though there was a trend to more male
180    non-neutralisers.
181
182    T cell and nAb responses are sometimes discordant
183    To better understand complementarity between nAb and T cells, we next compared
184    the T cell, S1 IgG and nAb responses in individual HCW. T cell responses to Spike
185    and NP protein correlated with peak S1 IgG titre, but with weak correlation
186    coefficients partly attributable to lack of T cell responses in some HCW with positive
187    antibody titres to Spike and NP (Fig. 3a; blue box in Extended Data Figs. 5a, d).
188    Correlations between peak NP IgG/IgM titre and T cell responses to Spike and NP
189    protein showed similar results (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Just over half HCW were
190    discordant for T cell and S1 IgG responses, making no T cell response to Spike
191    protein and 15% made no T cell response to NP(Extended Data Fig. 5a-f). While we
192    found no differences in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, symptom profile, clinical role
193    or PPE use, there tended to be more non-responders among Black, Asian and
194    minority ethnic (BAME) HCW.
195
196    In Fig. 2b, we showed that 10% of infected HCW lacked detectable nAb at 16-18
197    weeks after UK lockdown. To understand the complementarity between T cell and
198    nAb responses in individual HCW, we analysed responses of all HCW ranked either
199    by nAb IC50 titre or cumulative T cell response. We first arrayed HCW responses
200    ranked by magnitude of nAb response (Fig. 3b). Neutralisation IC50 values for all
201    HCW were plotted in relation to our indicative, protective cut-off value of >200 (dotted

202    horizontal red line in lower panel). HCW lacking detectable nAb are indicated by 7
203    black arrows on the left. Their cumulative T cell response frequencies against viral
204    antigens are shown in the panel above and are relatively low. Relating lack of nAbs
205    to T cell responses to different specific antigens we show that none of the 7 HCW
206    without detectable nAb make a T cell response to Spike protein (Extended data Fig
207    6b). The addition of data from Spike MEP pools (potentially encompassing CD8
208    responses as well) revealed low T cell responses to Spike in 4/7 HCW lacking a nAb
209    response (Extended data Fig 6c). Exploring T cell responses to NP protein and NP,
210    M, and ORF3a/7a MEP pools showed 5/7 HCW without detectable nAb making a T
211    cell response (Extended data Fig 6d). Furthermore, there were OLP T cell responses
212    in 5/7 HCW lacking nAb (Extended data Fig 6e). Thus HCW lacking nAb tend to lack
213    responses to Spike while maintaining low frequency T cells to other specificites.
214
215    Examining the converse, we then arrayed HCW responses ranked by magnitude of
216    cumulative T cell response (Fig 3c). From this plot, HCW with the lowest cumulative
217    T cell response (to the left of the plot) have a range of nAb responses from none to
218    >200 IC50. One young, asymptomatic, female HCW with a good peak S1 IgG titre
219    had no T cell response to any antigens tested but made nAbs with a titre of 143,
220    which may be insufficient for functional protection (Fig 3b,c indicated by +). Another
221    female HCW with a good S1 IgG titre, also had no T cell response to any antigens
222    tested, but made nAbs with a titre of 747 (Fig 3b,c indicated by *). Assessing T cell
223    responses ranked simply on the basis of presence or absence of recognition of
224    proteins and pools (rather than magnitude of response) indicates that those lacking a
225    nAb response (black arrows) showed T cell responses against 2 to 5 antigens
226    (Extended data Fig 6f). Taken together, the data show discordance of nAb and T cell
227    responses in individual HCW.
228
229    Of the 76 HCW studied with mild or asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-
230    2 infection, 64% had one or more case-defining symptoms, 25% had non-case-
231    defining symptoms and 11% were asymptomatic. Looking at T cell immunity and nAb
232    levels across these symptom-stratified groups at 16-18 weeks, T cell responses
233    tended to be higher in infected HCW with case defined symptoms. Responses to M
234    MEP and ORF3a OLP were significantly higher in HCW reporting case definition
235    symptoms than those that were asymptomatic (Extended Data Fig. 7a, b).

236    Importantly, there was no significant fall in nAb titres across case-defining, non-case-
237    defining symptoms and asymptomatic HCW groups (Fig. 2d) with 65%, 68% and
238    63% respectively showing an IC50 >200. Thus, the majority of HCW with laboratory-
239    confirmed infection have a detectable (and likely protective) level of nAbs at 16-18
240    weeks, whilst the 10% who lack detectable nAb have fewer T cells directed against
241    Spike but can show reactivity to other regions of the viral proteome.
242
243    Discussion
244    Much debate has focused on the possibility that the Ab response to SARS-CoV-2
245    may be short-lived, while T cell recognition may be strong, durable, and more
246    common 14,16,17,23,27,29. Mild or asymptomatic infection are very common but are not
247    usually diagnosed contemporaneously, making assessment of the durability of
248    immunity in this common group challenging. Here we describe a cross-sectional
249    study of an exposed HCW cohort at 16-18 weeks after UK lockdown who had mild or
250    asymptomatic infection picked up by repeated PCR and serological testing. This
251    cohort shows variable T cell responses across the viral proteome sampled, with only
252    two HCW with lab-confirmed COVID-19 showing no detectable T cell response
253    across all the platforms tested. In this study, 90% of HCW with asymptomatic or mild
254    COVID-19 had nAb at 16-18 weeks after UK lockdown and 66% had titres >200. In
255    light of some reports of rapid waning of nAbs this result was surprising15-17, 24,29. Here
256    we show a complex pattern of T cell and nAb responses for individual HCW.
257    Analysis of nAbs shows that the majority of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2
258    infected HCW with no symptoms or only mild disease had relatively high nAb IC50 at
259    16-18 weeks after UK lockdown. These IC50s were in the same range as those
260    defined as conferring functional protection in macaque challenge studies28. In terms
261    of neutralisation observations in humans, a study of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility
262    during an outbreak on a fishing vessel indicated a lack of infection in those showing
263    a prior nAb titre (IC50) >1/16030. In infection by SARS-CoV-1, nAbs are often lost by
264    1-2 years after infection19,31, whereas T cell responses can persist for up to 17y after
265    SARS-CoV-13. Longitudinal follow-up of nAb versus T cell kinetics in the
266    COVIDsortium cohort will illuminate T cell and nAb trajectories over time.
267
268    In terms of severe COVID-19 risk, two of the strongest factors identified have been
269    gender and age32. We found a positive correlation between both S1 IgG Ab level and
       	                                                              8

270    nAb IC50 with age in female study participants. Other observations have suggested
271    a higher T cell response to mitogens in females with acute hospitalised COVID-1933 ;
272    we observed higher memory T cell responses to Spike antigen in older males at 16-
273    18 weeks after UK lockdown. Thus, in this asymptomatic/mild cohort of HCW, the
274    nAb response increases significantly with age in females, while it is the T cell
275    response that increases significantly with age in males.
276
277    A cautionary note about the ephemeral nature of adaptive immunity to coronaviruses
278    comes from data for annual reinfections with the four seasonal coronaviruses and
279    emerging data for reinfection by SARS-CoV-234,35. Some studies have raised
280    concern about the durability of serum antibodies and B cell memory, with data
281    pointing towards impaired germinal centre reactions in severe acute COVID-1929.
282    Other studies have focused on the potential for rapid waning of nAb after mild SARS-
283    CoV-2 infection14,15. However we find nAb detectable in the majority of HCW
284    sampled 16-18 weeks after mild/asymptomatic infection. Some T cell data indicates
285    that even asymptomatic people and household contacts develop low-frequency T
286    cell responses, in line with results from the HCW without laboratory confirmed
287    infection using one of our platforms with higher T cell numbers6. We show here that
288    infected HCW can display highly heterogeneous T cell recognition of epitopes from
289    diverse SARS-CoV-2 structural and non-structural proteins, but it is not yet possible
290    to decode the differential impacts of these responses for protection. Analysis of T cell
291    response repertoire in convalescent, hospitalised COVID-19 patients argues that
292    breadth of T cell response is a marker of mild disease36.
293
294    In summary, this study of HCW with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
295    finds that in the majority of these working adults there is immunity at 16-18 weeks
296    comprising nAb (often at a level likely to protect), usually complemented by multi-
297    specific T cell responses. Understanding protective immunity in the population will
298    require simultaneous scrutiny of T cell and antibody responses.

408    Ethics statement
409    The COVIDsortium Healthcare Workers bioresource was approved by the ethical
410    committee of UK National Research Ethics Service (20/SC/0149) and registered on
411    ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04318314). The study conformed to the principles of the
412    Helsinki Declaration, and all subjects gave written informed consent.
413
414    Pre-pandemic healthy donor samples were collected and cryopreserved before
415    October 2019. Pre-pandemic cohort 1 and 2 samples were recruited under ethics
416    numbers 17/LO/0800 and 11/LO/0421 respectively.
417
418    COVIDsortium Healthcare Worker Participants
419    Adult HCW (>18 years old) from a range of clinical settings who self-declared as fit
420    to attend work were invited to participate via local advertisement of the project (see
421    https://covid-consortium.com). Full study details of the bioresource (participant
422    screening, study design, sample collection, and sample processing) have been
423    previously published10.
424
425    A cohort of 400 HCW was initially recruited from St Bartholomew’s Hospital, London,
426    in the week of UK lockdown (23rd-31st March 2020). All participants were
427    asymptomatic and self-declared fit to attend work in hospital. Recruitment was
428    extended (27th April-7th May 2020) to include 331 additional participants from multiple
429    sites: St Bartholomew’s Hospital (n=101 additional), NHS Nightingale Hospital
430    (n=10), and Royal Free NHS Hospital Trust (n=220).
431
432    A prospective, observational, longitudinal cohort design was used and consisted of
433    questionnaires exploring demographic, clinical and exposure risks, and sample
434    collection at baseline and weekly follow-up for 15w from the start of each cohort.
435    Participants were asked to provide details and timing of symptoms in the 3 months
436    prior to baseline, and for those who were unable to attend follow-up visits (due to
437    shift rostering, annual leave or self-isolation), the reason for non-attendance was
438    collected, to ensure capture of information regarding isolation due to participant
439    symptoms or household contacts. On return from self-isolation with symptoms,
       	                                                              13

467    At baseline, information relating to demographics and exposures was collected via a
468    standardised questionnaire. Mean age of the cohort (n=731) was 38±11 years; 33%
469    are male, 31% nurses, 20% doctors, and 19% work in intensive care units. COVID-
470    19-associated risk factors were: 37% Black, Asian or minority ethnicities (BAME);
471    18% smokers; 13% obesity; 11% asthma; 7% hypertension and 2% diabetes
472    mellitus10. At weekly follow-up visits information relating to symptom burden was
473    recorded using a standardised questionnaire. Symptoms were classified as follows:

482    A total of 731 HCW underwent 16 weeks of serial assessment (attending unless ill,
483    self-isolating, on holiday, or redeployed). Across the main study cohort, 48
484    participants had positive RT-PCR results with 157 (21.5%) seropositive participants.
485    Infections were asymptomatic or mild with only two hospital admissions (neither
486    requiring intensive care admission, both discharged well). The cohort therefore
487    represents working age community COVID-19 rather than hospitalised COVID-19.
488
489    The cross-sectional case controlled sub-study (n=136) collected samples at 16-18
490    weeks after UK lockdown (Extended Data Table 1a, Extended Data Fig. 8). The
491    cross-sectional case controlled sub-study included 76 HCW (mean age 41y, 36%
492    male) with laboratory defined evidence of SARS-CoV-2 either by SARS-CoV-2
493    positive PCR and/or positive for spike IgG (Euroimmun ELISA)/ NP IgG/IgM antibody
494    (Roche Elecsys). Fifty-seven percent reported one or more case defining COVID-19
495    symptoms. Twenty-four percent reported non-case defining symptoms and 19%
496    were asymptomatic at baseline, during 16-week follow-up or in the 3 months prior to
497    baseline. A second age, gender, and ethnicity matched subgroup of sixty HCW were
498    recruited (mean age 39y, 37% male) who were SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative and
499    negative for Spike IgG (Euroimmun ELISA) and NP IgG/IgM antibody (Roche
500    Elecsys) tests throughout the 16-week follow-up.                                   However, forty-four percent
501    reported one or more case defining COVID-19 symptoms, 41% non-case defining
502    symptoms and 15% were asymptomatic at baseline, during 16-week follow-up and in
503    the 3 months prior to baseline.

507    Isolation of PBMC
508    Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from heparinized blood
509    samples using Pancoll (Pan Biotech) or Histopaque®-1077 Hybri-MaxTM (Sigma-
510    Aldrich) density gradient centrifugation in SepMate™ tubes (Stemcell) according to
511    the manufacturer specifications. Isolated PBMCs were cryopreserved in fetal calf
512    serum containing 10% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen.
513    Isolation of serum
514    Whole blood samples were collected in SST vacutainers (VACUETTE® #455092)
515    with inert polymer gel for serum separation and clot activator coating. After
516    centrifugation at 1000 X g for 10 minutes at room temperature, serum layer was
517    aliquoted and stored at -80 C for specific SARS-CoV-2 Ab titre detection by ELISA
518    and for SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped virus neutralisation assays.
519    SARS-CoV-2 specific Ab titre
520    Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG ELISA (EUROIMMUN) was performed on a Stratec
521    Biomedical Gemini automated ELISA platform as described. The optical density was
522    detected at 450nm, and a ratio of the reading of each sample to the reading of the
523    calibrator included in the kit was calculated for each sample. An OD ratio of ≥1.1 was
524    interpreted as positive for S1 antibodies by manufacturer’s recommendation.
525    Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid total Ab ELISA (ROCHE) was performed
526    as described. Results are reported as numeric values in the form of a cut-off index
527    (COI; signal sample/cut-off) as well as in the form of qualitative results non-reactive
528    (COI < 1.0; negative) and reactive (COI ≥ 1.0; positive).
529    Recombinant proteins
530    The SARS-CoV-2 S1 Spike antigen and Nucleoprotein was obtained from the Centre
531    for AIDS Reagents (CFAR), National Institute for Biological Standards and Control
532    (NIBSC), UK: SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein and S1 Spike antigen from Dr Peter
533    Cherepanov, Francis Crick Institute, UK.

534    Mapped epitope pools (MEP)
535    Pools of 13-20mer peptides based on the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 S1
536    (Spike), nucleoprotein (NP), membrane (M) and open reading frames 3a and 7a
537    (ORF3a/7a) described previously were synthesized4 (GL Biochem Shanghai Ltd,
538    China). To stimulate PBMC, separate pools of sequences for Spike (18 peptides),
539    NP (10 peptides), M (6 peptides) and ORF3a/7a (7 peptides) were used, see
540    Extended Data Table 2a).                        A second mapped epitope pool of SARS-CoV-2 S1
541    peptides (Spike MEP2) based on alignment of all sequences of published SARS-
542    CoV-1 epitopes (www.iedb.org; search criteria: positive assays only, T cells assays,
543    host: human) with the Spike-SARS-CoV-2 sequence and 15-mer peptides
544    synthesised to cover the homologous sequences. In addition, we synthesised 15-
545    mer peptides covering the predicted SARS-CoV-2 Spike epitopes3 to give a total of
546    55 peptides in this pool (Spike MEP2), see Extended Data Table 2b
547    Overlapping peptide pools (OLP):
548    15-mer peptides overlapping by 10 amino acids spanning the entire protein
549    sequence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP), Membrane (M) and ORF3a were
550    synthesized (GL Biochem Shanghai Ltd; see Extended Data Tables 2b). To
551    stimulate PBMC, the peptides were divided into 4 pools covering NP (NP-1, NP-2 ,
552    41 peptides each), M (43 peptides), and ORF3a (53 peptides).
553    IFNγ-ELISpot Assay
554    Unless otherwise stated, culture medium for human T cells was sterile 0.22µM
555    filtered RPMI medium (GibcoBRL) supplemented with 10% by volume heat
556    inactivated (1h, 64°C) fetal calf serum (FCS; Hyclone, and 1% by volume 100x

558    For experiments involving T cell stimulation with proteins or MEP peptide pools, pre-
559    coated ELISpot plates (Mabtech 3420-2APT) were washed x4 with sterile PBS and
560    were blocked with R10 for 1h at room temperature. 200,000 PBMC were seeded in
561    R10/well and were stimulated for 18-22h at 37°C with 5%CO2 with SARS-CoV-2
562    recombinant proteins (10µg/ml) or MEP pools (10µg/ml/peptide).                                           Internal plate

563    controls were R10 alone (without cells) and anti-CD3 (Mabtech mAb CD3-2). At the
564    end of the stimulation period, cell culture supernatants were collected and stored for
565    later cytokine analysis by Luminex. ELISpot plates were developed with human
566    biotinylated IFNγ detection Ab, directly conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (7-B6-1-
567    ALP, Mabtech; 1µg/ml), diluted in PBS with 0.5% FCS, incubating 50µl/well for 2h at
568    room temperature. This was followed by 50µl/well of sterile filtered BCIP/NBT-plus
569    Phosphatase Substrate (Mabtech) for 5 minutes at room temperature. Plates were
570    washed in ddH20 and left to dry completely before being read on AID-ELISpot plate
571    reader. For experiments involving T cell stimulation with OLP peptide pools and
572    Spike MEP2 pool ELISpot plates (AID classic ELISpot plate reader (Autoimmun
573    Diagnostika GMBH, Germany) were coated with human anti-IFNγ Ab (1-D1K,
574    Mabtech; 10µg/ml) in PBS overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed x6 with sterile PBS
575    and were blocked with R10 for 2h at 37°C with 5% CO2. PBMC were thawed and
576    rested in R10 for 3h at 37 °C with 5%CO2 before being counted. 400,000 PBMC
577    were seeded in R10/well and were stimulated for 16-20h with SARS-CoV-2 OLP
578    pools or Spike MEP2 pool (2µg/ml/peptide). Internal plate controls were R10 alone
579    (without cells) and two DMSO wells (negative controls), concanavalin A (ConA,
580    positive control; Sigma-Aldrich) and FEC (HLAI-restricted peptides from influenza,
581    Epstein-Barr virus, and CMV; 1µg/ml). ELISpot plates were developed with human
582    biotinylated IFN-γ detection antibody (7-B6-1, Mabtech; 1µg/ml) for 3h at room
583    temperature, followed by incubation with goat anti-biotin alkaline phosphatase
584    (Vector Laboratories; 1:1000) for 2h at room temperature, both diluted in PBS with
585    0.5% BSA by volume (Sigma-Aldrich), and finally with 50µl/well of sterile filtered
586    BCIP/NBT Phosphatase Substrate (ThermoFisher) for 7 minutes at room
587    temperature. Plates were washed in ddH20 and left to dry overnight before being
588    read on an AID classic ELISpot plate reader (Autoimmun Diagnostika GMBH,
589    Germany).
590    Analysis of ELISpot data was performed in Microsoft Excel. The average of two R10
591    alone wells or DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) wells was subtracted from all peptide
592    stimulated wells and any response that was lower in magnitude than 2 standard
593    deviations of the sample specific control wells was not considered a peptide specific
594    response. Results were expressed as difference in (delta) spot forming cells per 106
595    PBMC between the negative control and protein/peptide stimulation conditions. We

597    control wells (ConA or anti-CD3) were negative. Results were plotted using Prism v.
598    7.0e and 8.0 for Mac OS (GraphPad).
599    Cytokine measurement
600    Concentrations of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17a and IL-23 were measured by multiplex
601    Luminex® assay (Bio-Techne) on a Bio-Plex 200 instrument (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
602    Ltd). Cytokine levels in cell culture supernatants in response to PBMC stimulation
603    with Spike or NP protein were calculated in Microsoft Excel by subtracting values
604    obtained for media only controls. Standard curves were plotted using Prism 8.0 for
605    Mac OS (GraphPad).
606    Cell Lines
607    HEK-293T and Huh7 (both ATCC) were cultured and maintained in high glucose
608    Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium and supplemented with GlutaMAX, 10% (v/v)
609    heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS, 56°C for 30 minutes), 100IU/ml penicillin
610    and 100µg/ml streptomycin. Cell lines were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2.
611    Production and titration of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviral reporter
612    particles
613    Pseudotype stocks were prepared by linear polyethylenimine 25K (Polysciences) co-
614    transfection of HEK-293T (ATCC) with SARS-CoV-2 spike pcDNA expression
615    plasmid, HIV gag-pol p8.91 plasmid and firefly luciferase expressing plasmid
616    pCSFLW at a 1:1:1.5 ratio37,38. 2.5x104 cells/cm2 were plated 24h prior to transfection
617    in 60cm2 cell culture dishes. 48 and 72h post transfection, pseudotype-containing
618    culture medium was harvested and centrifuged at 500xg for 5 minutes to clear cell
619    debris. Aliquots were stored at -80°C. TCID assays were performed by transduction
620    of Huh7 cells to calculate the viral titre and infectious dose for neutralisation assays.
621    p24 ELISA was also used to determine input concentration.

628    Pseudoviral supernatants were treated with 1% Empigen BB (Merck) for 30 min at
629    56°C and then plated at 1:10 dilution in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) on pre-coated
630    plates and incubated for 3h at room temperature. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
631    mouse anti-HIV-1 p24 monoclonal antibody (Aalto Bio Reagents) in TBS, 20% (v/v)
632    sheep serum, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 was then added and incubated for 1h at room
633    temperature. After 4 washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-0.01% (v/v)
634    Tween 20 and 2 washes with ELISA Light washing buffer (ThermoFisher), CSPD
635    substrate with Sapphire II enhancer (ThermoFisher) was added and incubated for 30
636    minutes at room temperature before chemiluminescence detection using a
637    CLARIOStar Plate Reader (BMG Labtech).
638    Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays
639    SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype neutralisation assays were conducted using pseudotyped
640    lentiviral particles as previously described37-40. Serum was heat-inactivated at 56ºC
641    for 30 minutes to remove complement activity. Serum dilutions in DMEM were
642    performed in duplicate in white, flat-bottom 96-well plates (ThermoFisher, #136101)
643    with a starting dilution of 1 in 20 and 7 consecutive 2-fold dilutions to a final dilution
644    of 1/2,560 in a total volume of 100µl. 1 x105 RLU of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped
645    lentiviral particles were added to each well and incubated at 37ºC for 1h. 8 control
646    wells per plate received pseudotype and cells only (virus control) and another 8 wells
647    received cells only (background control). 4x104 Huh7 cells suspended in 100µl
648    complete media were added per well and incubated for 72h at 37°C and 5% CO2.
649    Firefly luciferase activity (luminescence) was measured using Steady-Glo®
650    Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a CLARIOStar Plate Reader (BMG
651    Labtech). The curves of relative infection rates (in %) versus the serum dilutions
652    (log10 values) against a negative control of pooled sera collected prior to 2016
653    (Sigma) and a positive neutraliser were plotted using Prism 8 (GraphPad). A non-

654    linear regression method was used to determine the dilution fold that neutralised
655    50% (IC50).
656    Statistics and reproducibility
657    Data was assumed to have a non-Gaussian distribution. Non-parametric tests were
658    used throughout. For single paired and unpaired comparisons Wilcoxon matched-
659    pairs signed rank test and a Mann-Whitney t-test were used. For multiple paired and
660    unpaired comparisons Friedman multiple comparisons ANOVA with Dunn's
661    correction or Kruskal-Wallis one-way Anova with Dunn’s correction were used. For
662    correlations, Spearman’s r test was used. A p value <0.05 was considered
663    significant. Prism v. 7.0e and 8.0 for Mac was used for analysis.

Figure. 3. Concordant and discordant T cell and nAb responses in HCW (laboratory-confirmed COVID-19) at 16-18 weeks
after UK lockdown. a) Correlations between the peak S1 IgG Ab titre and T cell responses to Spike protein (left) or NP protein
(right) in HCW with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 75). b) Top panel; Cumulative magnitude of the T cell
response to Spike and NP proteins, mapped epitope peptide (MEP and MEP2) panels and overlapping peptide (OLP) panels (top
panel) ordered by increasing magnitude of nAb response (bottom panel) or c) Magnitude of nAb response (top panel) ordered by
increasing cumulative magnitude of T cell response to Spike and NP proteins, MEP/MEP2 panels and OLP panels (bottom panel)
in HCW with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 70). HCW with no nAb (IC50 titre less than 50) are indicated by
black arrows. + and * denote individuals with no T cell response to any protein or peptide pool. d) Proportion of HCW with a nAb
titre (IC50) or T cell response to Spike and NP proteins within given ranges stratified by symptom group; >1 COVID-19 case
definition symptoms (n = 43 or 48), non-case definition symptoms (n = 19) or asymptomatic (n = 8) a) Spearman’s rank correlation.

Extended Data Figure 1.                             T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in
HCW with and without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 16-18
weeks after UK lockdown:
a) Magnitude of the T cell response to Spike mapped epitope pool 2 (Spike
MEP2), overlapping peptide pools (OLP), the summed total response to OLP
pools + Spike MEP2, and response to positive control FEC peptide pool
(covering CD8 epitopes from flu, EBV, CMV) in HCW with laboratory-confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 71).
b) Magnitude of the T cell response to Spike MEP2 and OLP pools in the
following groups: HCW with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n =
71); HCW with no laboratory-confirmed infection but with >1 COVID-19 case
definition symptoms (n = 15), non-case definition symptoms (n = 15) or
asymptomatic (n = 10); pre-COVID-19 pandemic control cohort 2 (n = 19).
c,d) Magnitude of the T cell response to Spike and NP proteins c) and mapped
epitope pools (MEP) d) in the following groups: HCW with laboratory-confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 75); HCW with no laboratory-confirmed infection but
with >1 COVID-19 case definition symptoms (n = 26), non-case definition
symptoms (n = 24) or asymptomatic (n = 9); pre-COVID-19 pandemic control
cohort 1 (n = 20).
e) Number of HCW with detectable IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17A or IL-23 cytokine
levels in T cell ELISpot supernatants by Luminex assay. Example cytokine
standard curves and the concentration range of each cytokine assay are shown.
a-d) Bars at geomean. a) Friedman multiple comparisons ANOVA with Dunn’s
correction. b-d) Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparisons ANOVA with Dunn’s
correction. Ab, antibody; HCW, health care workers; M, Membrane; ORF, open
reading frame; NP, Nucleoprotein; S1, Spike subunit 1; SFC, spot forming cells

Extended Data Figure 4.                                 Demographic characteristics of HCW with
laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection but no nAb at 16-18 weeks
after UK lockdown
a) Neutralisation (%) curves of serum from selected HCW with laboratory-
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (red line with red triangles), a positive
neutralising control serum (black line with black circles) and a negative non-
neutralising control serum (black squares). Example neutralisation curves of
participants with high (top row), low (middle row) or no neutralising ability (bottom
row) are shown.
b) The nAb titre (IC50) in HCW with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
(n = 70). HCW with no neutralising antibody (n = 7) are within the lower blue
box.
c) The age in years of HCW for whom nAb were detected (top) or were not
(bottom).
d) Proportion of HCW with nAb (top row), or no nAb (bottom row) stratified by the
demographic characteristics of gender, ethnicity, clinical role, clinical location,
PPE or symptom profile.

Extended Data Figure 5.                                 Demographic characteristics of health care
workers with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection but no T cell
response to Spike or NP protein at 16-18 weeks after UK lockdown:
a) Correlation between peak S1 IgG Ab titre and T cell response to Spike protein
in HCW with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, coloured by symptom
group: HCW who had > 1 COVID-19 case definition symptoms (Red), non-case
definition symptoms (Blue) or were asymptomatic (Grey). HCW with no T cell
response to Spike protein are within the blue box.
b) The age in years of HCW for whom a T cell response to Spike protein was
detected (top) or was not (bottom).
c) Proportion of HCW with a T cell response to Spike protein (top row), or no T cell
response          to      Spike           protein        (bottom        row)     stratified         by   the     demographic
characteristics of gender, ethnicity, clinical role, clinical location, PPE or symptom
profile.
d) Correlation between peak S1 IgG Ab titre and T cell response to NP protein in
HCW with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, coloured by symptom
group as above. HCW with no T cell response to NP protein are within the blue
box.
e) The age in years of HCW for whom a T cell response to NP protein was
detected (top) or was not (bottom).
f) Proportion of HCW with a T cell response to NP protein (top row), or no T cell
response to NP protein (bottom row) stratified by the demographic characteristics
of gender, ethnicity, clinical role, clinical location, PPE or symptom profile.

Extended Data Figure 6. Correlations between antibody and T cell
responses in HCW with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
a) Correlations between the peak NP IgG/IgM antibody titre and T cell
responses to NP protein (left) and Spike protein (right) in HCW with laboratory-
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=75)
b-e) Top panels; Magnitude of the T cell response to Spike protein (n = 75) b)
Cumulative magnitude of T cell responses to Spike protein and Spike mapped
epitope peptide (MEP and MEP2) pools (n = 70) c) NP protein and NP, M and
ORF3a/7a MEP pools (n = 75) d) or NP1, NP2, M and ORF3a overlapping
peptide (OLP) pools (n = 70) e) ordered by increasing cumulative magnitude of
T cell responses in HCW with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Bottom panels; nAb titres (IC50) in HCW with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-
2 infection, ordered by corresponding top panel.
f) The number of reactive SARS-CoV-2 proteins or peptide pools (top panel)
and nAb titre (IC50; bottom panel) in HCW with laboratory-confirmed SARS-
CoV-2 infection (n = 70). Top panel ordered by cumulative magnitude; bottom
panel ordered by top panel. HCW with no nAb (IC50 titre less than 50) are
indicated by black arrows. + and * denote two individuals with no T cell
response to any protein or peptide pool. a) Spearman’s rank correlation, least
squares log-log lines shown. HCW, health care workers; M, Membrane; nd, not
done; nAb; neutralising antibody; NP, Nucleoprotein; ORF, open reading frame;
