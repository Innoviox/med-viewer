          Abstract
          Background
          If we were to keep macrolide consumption below a certain threshold, would this
          reduce the probability of macrolide resistance emerging? No study that we are aware
          of has addressed this question.
          Methods
          We assessed at a country level if there was a macrolide consumption threshold for
          the selection of a prevalence of macrolide resistance of over 5% in Streptococcus
          pneumoniae, Treponema pallidum and Mycoplasma genitalium.
          Results
          We found evidence for a macrolide consumption threshold of 1.3 defined daily doses
          per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID) for M. genitalium, 1.8 DID for T. pallidum and 2.3
          DID for S. pneumoniae.
          Conclusions
          Our results provide further motivation for macrolide stewardship campaigns that
          strive to reduce macrolide consumption to levels below at least 2 DID.

          Background
          Whilst it is widely accepted that antimicrobial consumption plays a crucial role in the
          emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), there is little consensus as
          to whether or not this association is linear (1). Certain authors have claimed that
          there is a ‘use it and loose it’ relationship whereby AMR is viewed as the inevitable
          outcome of using antimicrobials (1, 2). In contrast, Levy hypothesized that there
          were thresholds of antimicrobial consumption, below which AMR was unlikely to
          emerge and spread (3). A recent longitudinal study has provided epidemiological
          evidence to back up the existence of such thresholds for a range of bug-drug
          combinations. In this study, minimum antimicrobial consumption thresholds were
          identified for carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii, cephalosporin
          resistance in Escherichia coli, gentamicin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
          and methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (1). This study was, however,
          limited to isolates from inpatients in 5 European countries. It would be useful to know
          if there were also thresholds of antimicrobial consumption in the general population.
          If so, these could be used as targets in antimicrobial stewardship campaigns (4). In
          this paper, we assess if the ecological evidence supports the existence of a
          macrolide consumption threshold for the induction of macrolide resistance in
          Streptococcus pneumoniae, Treponema pallidum and Mycoplasma genitalium.
          Ecological studies are justified and important in this field as the pathway between
          consumption and AMR operates at both individual and population levels. Lipsitch et
          al. outlined four mechanisms by which antibiotic treatment could select for resistance
          at a population-level (5). As an example, treatment with macrolides is likely to
          eradicate susceptible streptococci from an individual leading to the individual both
                                                                                                                                4

          being less likely to transmit susceptible streptococci to others and being at a higher
          risk of colonization by resistant streptococci (5, 6). Both these effects may be easier
          to detect at a population- than an individual-level (5, 6).
          The relative importance of bystander selection to the emergence of AMR varies by
          bacterial species according to factors such as the proportion of the time that the
          bacteria circulate in a population as an asymptomatic colonizer (7). All three
          organisms chosen for the current analysis are asymptomatic for the majority of the
          time they circulate in a population (7-10). In addition, an ecological association has
          been found between population level consumption of macrolides and macrolide
          resistance for each of these organisms. For streptococci, for example, previous
          papers have found strong associations between macrolide consumption and AMR in
          S. pneumoniae (11-13) and group A Streptococcus (12). This association has been
          found to apply at national (12, 14) and sub-national levels (11, 15). Similar results
          have been found for T. pallidum and M. genitalium (8, 16). These analyses all used
          linear regression to assess the association between consumption and resistance and
          did not assess for the existence of a threshold effect. We were unable to find a study
          that evaluated if there was evidence of antimicrobial consumption thresholds in any
          of these species.

          The S. pneumoniae susceptibility data from 2005 to 2018 was taken from the
          European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) Surveillance Atlas
          which reports resistance prevalence estimates from the European Antimicrobial
          Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) - the EU’s main surveillance system
          for AMR in bacteria that cause serious infections. All 28 EU Member States and two
          EEA countries (Iceland and Norway) participate in EARS-Net, but one country
          (Greece) does not report data on S. pneumoniae. Only data from invasive (blood and
          cerebrospinal fluid) isolates are included in EARS-Net. This is done to limit biases
          that may emerge if isolates from all anatomical sites were included. Further details
          can be found in the EARS-Net reporting protocol (17). The system depends on
          national network representatives in each participating country, reporting their locally
          tested susceptibility data to The European Surveillance System on an annual basis.
          The data for macrolide resistance reports the prevalence of resistance (as a percent)
          to erythromycin, clarithromycin or azithromycin. The details of the survey
          methodology                   and          susceptibility          testing          are          available           at
          https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/surveillance-atlas-infectious-diseases.                                 For       each
          country, we calculated the median prevalence of macrolide resistance in the years
          2005 to 2018.
          Antimicrobial consumption data
          Data from the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC) were
          used as a measure of national general population-level antimicrobial drug
          consumption (18, 19). ESAC provides open access to the data collected on
          antimicrobial use in ambulatory care and hospital care in 30 European countries (18,
          19). ESAC reports antimicrobial consumption as the number of defined daily doses
                                                                                                                                6

          (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID) following the World Health Organization
          guidelines (19, 20). One DDD is defined as the average maintenance dose per day
          for a drug used in its main indication for adults (19, 20). We used ATC group J01F
          (macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins), which is how ESAC reports
          macrolide consumption. Data was available from 1998 to 2018.
          Treponema pallidum
          The data for the prevalence of genotypic (A2058G or A2059G, Escherichia coli
          numbering) macrolide resistance in T. pallidum were extracted from a global country-
          level study that used linear regression to assess the association between macrolide
          consumption and resistance in T. pallidum (8). The national prevalence of genotypic
          macrolide resistance was based on a literature review (8). Where more than one
          prevalence estimate was available per country, the peak prevalence of resistance
          was used. The macrolide consumption data, expressed in DID, (for the year prior to
          that which provided the resistance prevalence) was taken from MIDAS Quantum
          database of the marketing research company IQVIA (IQVIA, Danbury, CT). IQVIA
          uses national sample surveys that are performed by pharmaceutical sales
          distribution channels to estimate antimicrobial consumption from the volume of
          antibiotics sold in retail and hospital pharmacies.
          Mycoplasma genitalium
          The data for both AMR and macrolide consumption were taken from a global study
          that compared macrolide consumption and resistance in M. genitalium (16). The
          prevalence of genotypic resistance to macrolides (mutations at positions 2058 or
          2059 in 23S rRNA) used in this study was the country prevalence of macrolide
                                                                                                                                7

          resistance estimated by a systematic review of the prevalence of macrolide and
          fluoroquinolone resistance in M. genitalium (9). The macrolide consumption data
          used in this analysis was taken from the year prior to the resistance prevalence
          estimate (16). The macrolide consumption data, in DID, was obtained from the same
          IQVIA source described above.
          Timing of emergence of macrolide resistance in relation to total macrolide and
          azithromycin consumption
          A number of studies have suggested that the widespread use of the long acting
          macrolide, azithromycin has played an important role in the genesis of macrolide
          resistance in S. pneumoniae and T. pallidum (10, 21, 22). To illustrate the putative
          association between total macrolide/azithromycin consumption and macrolide
          resistance we plotted the emergence of AMR by year in T. pallidum (23, 24), M.
          genitalium (9) and S. pneumoniae (10) in the United States in relation to the increase
          in sales of azithromycin in this population (sales were used as a proxy for
          consumption levels) (10) and total macrolide consumption. The data for azithromycin
          sales were taken from a paper that obtained annual sales from the manufacturer’s
          (Pfizer) annual financial reports (10). Sales data was available till 2005 when the
          azithromycin patent expired in the USA. Total macrolide consumption in DID was
          obtained from the IQVIA database described above. Data was available for the years
          2000 to 2015. The resistance prevalence estimates for T. pallidum were taken from
          two STI clinics (San Francisco and Seattle (22, 23), for M. genitalium from the
          systematic review described above (9) and for S. pneumoniae from a paper that
          compiled resistance prevalence estimates from a literature review of the topic (10).
                                                                                                                                8

          Analyses
          We used an unvalidated but novel and simple method to define a putative macrolide
          consumption threshold for AMR. The US Centers for Disease Control and
          Prevention, the World Health Organization and others have recommended changing
          treatment protocols for Neisseria gonorrhoeae once the prevalence of AMR exceeds
          5% (25, 26). Although somewhat arbitrary, we used >5% as our threshold of high
          prevalence of resistance. For each bacterial species, we then defined the macrolide-
          5% threshold as the highest median level of macrolide consumption of countries with
          a median resistance prevalence                    ൑5% for S. pneumoniae and M. genitalium and the
          peak resistance prevalence ൑5% for T. pallidum.
          We compared differences in macrolide consumption between groups of countries
          using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The statistical analyses were performed in Stata
          16.0. A P-value of <0.05 was regarded as significant.
          Ethics approval
          This analysis involved ecological analyses of public access data, and thus, no Ethics
          approval was necessary.
          Results
          In the countries with available macrolide resistance estimates, the consumption of
          macrolides varied considerably. In the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial
          Consumption dataset, macrolide consumption was relatively stable between 1998
          and 2018 - with the notable exceptions of Bulgaria, Ireland, France and Poland (Fig.
          1). The median country macrolide consumptions varied between 0.8 DID in Sweden,
                                                                                                                                9

          and 4.9 DID in Italy (median 2.9 DID, IQR 2.2-3.4). Likewise, in the global IQVIA
          dataset, macrolide consumption varied considerably (Fig. 2).
          Large variations were also evident in the prevalence of macrolide resistance to M.
          genitalium, T. pallidum and S. pneumoniae (Fig. 2).
          Macrolide-5% threshold in S. pneumoniae
          The prevalence of macrolide resistance was                          ൑5%      in 6 countries - Sweden, the
          Netherlands, Latvia, Norway, Denmark and Estonia (Fig. 2). The highest macrolide
          consumption in these countries was 2.3 DID in Estonia (median 1.6, IQR 1.3-2.2).
          The prevalence of macrolide resistance was lower in countries that consumed less
          versus more macrolides than this threshold – median 5.2% (IQR 4.5-12.7%) and
          median 20.1% (IQR 15.6-26.2%), respectively; P<0.001.
          Macrolide-5% threshold in T. pallidum
          The prevalence of macrolide resistance in T. pallidum was                           ൑5% in 5 countries (Peru,
          Madagascar, South Africa, Taiwan and Russia). Of these countries, macrolide
          consumption was highest in Taiwan (1.8 DID). The prevalence of macrolide
          resistance was considerably lower in countries that consumed less versus those that
          consumed more macrolides than this threshold – median 1.2%, (IQR 0-14.3%) and
          median 84%, (IQR 66.7-100%), respectively; P=0.011.
          Macrolide-5% threshold in M. genitalium
          Macrolide resistance was                    ൑5%     in 2 countries (Kenya and Russia). Macrolide
          consumption data was not available for Kenya and was 1.3 DID in Russia. The
                                                                                                                              10

          prevalence of macrolide resistance was higher in countries above this threshold
          (median 41%, IQR 12.6-61.3%) than Russia (3.7%) but this difference was not
          statistically significant (P=0.137).
          Timing of emergence of macrolide resistance in relation to azithromycin
          consumption
          Azithromycin sales in the United States increased rapidly from close to zero dollars
          in 1991 to over $2 billion in 2005 (Fig. 3). This increase was followed approximately
          three years later by an increase in macrolide resistance in S. pneumoniae from close
          to zero to above 30%. The rapid increases in macrolide resistance in T. pallidum and
          M. genitalium, however, followed approximately 10 and 20 years after the increase in
          azithromycin consumption. Total macrolide consumption was high in 2000 (4.4 DID)
          and, whilst it decreased over time (2.6 DID in 2015), it remained high compared to
          consumption in countries such as Sweden (0.6 DID in 2015).
          Discussion
          The application of our macrolide-5% methodology produced evidence of a macrolide
          consumption threshold of 1.3 DID for M. genitalium, 1.8 DID for T. pallidum and 2.3
          DID for S. pneumoniae.
          There are a number of caveats to this conclusion, not the least of which is that we
          have only investigated the impact of a single variable on the genesis of AMR. The
          emergence and spread of AMR is dependent on multiple factors acting at different
          levels (1, 2, 27, 28). These factors include homologous and heterologous class
          antimicrobial consumption (individual and population level), vaccination, travel and
                                                                                                                              11

          sanitation (1, 2, 8, 27-29). The relative contributions of specific risk factors (such as
          population level macrolide consumption) is also likely to vary between bacterial
          species according to factors such as the mechanisms whereby they acquire
          macrolide resistance as well as their susceptibility to bystander selection (7, 29, 30).
          This is evident if we consider the differences in the timing of the emergence of
          macrolide resistance in the three organisms in the USA. If the effect of population
          level macrolide consumption on AMR was uniform, then we would expect macrolide
          resistance to emerge concurrently. A number of factors may play a role in explaining
          differences in the timing of resistance emerging. The prevalence of S. pneumoniae is
          typically higher than that of T. pallidum and M. genitalium which may have placed it
          under a greater selection pressure from population level consumption of macrolides
          (7). The incidence of T. pallidum in the USA was low in the 1980s and early 1990s
          and only began to increase in the late 1990s which may have meant that T. pallidum
          would only have been placed under a selection pressure from macrolides consumed
          for other purposes in the late 1990s (31). The data from the Seattle cohort supports
          this conclusion. Macrolides were not used to treat syphilis in this center, but a high
          proportion of clients (27%) had received macrolides for other indications in the 12
          months prior to their syphilis diagnosis and self-reported macrolide use was
          associated with macrolide resistance in T. pallidum (22). The delayed increase in
          macrolide resistance in M. genitalium may be explained by changes in treatment
          guidelines for STIs such as the use of azithromycin in combination with ceftriaxone
          as first line treatment for N. gonorrhoeae in 2010 (26). A complementary explanation
          is that increases in screening and treatment of STIs that can be treated with
          azithromycin such as chlamydia and M. genitalium played a role (32, 33).

          A number of other factors may explain the differences in the association between
          macrolide consumption and resistance in the three species. Differences in the fitness
          costs of resistance associated mutations may be important. Variations in the
          biological pathways to macrolide resistance between the three species also likely
          play an important role. S. pneumoniae can take up resistance conferring sections of
          DNA (such as erm-type methylases and mef-type efflux pumps) via transformation
          and conjugation (29, 34). This process has been shown to have played an important
          role in its acquisition of resistance to macrolides (34). M. genitalium and T. pallidum
          do not have this ability and the acquisition of resistance typically results from
          chromosomal mutations in the gene coding for the 23s RNA (8, 9, 22).
          There are also a number of countries with low reported consumption of macrolides
          but a high prevalence of macrolide resistance. The high prevalence of macrolide
          resistance in T. pallidum in China is an example (Fig. 2). These examples could be
          explained by high macrolide consumption in local populations with high prevalence
          of circulating T. pallidum (such as core-groups) or the acquisition of resistant strains
          via travel from high consumption countries (8). The very high prevalence of
          macrolide resistance in other bacterial species, as well as T. pallidum in China could
          also be explained by a false low estimate of macrolide consumption in this
          population (8, 30). It is possible that countries with                        ൑5%      macrolide resistance in
          these bacterial species will still cross this resistance threshold. Evidence along these
          lines is available for the two countries (France and Belgium) with low macrolide
          resistance in M. genitalium (6.5% and 11.3%, respectively) but high macrolide
          consumption (Fig. 2). The resistance prevalence estimates from both countries were
          derived from relatively old studies used in the systematic review (9). More recent
                                                                                                                              13

          studies have found a much higher prevalence of macrolide resistance in both
          countries (74% and 58%, respectively) (35, 36). These limitations mean that the
          results should be viewed with caution and require further validation. The way that
          travel can disseminate AMR may also mean that for certain bacterial species, a
          threshold may only be effective if globally applied (37).
          Despite these limitations, the study may provide guidance to health planners. For
          example, there is considerable debate in the literature as to the net benefits and
          risks of screening men who have sex with men in pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
          cohorts for gonorrhoea and chlamydia (32, 33, 38, 39). PrEP guidelines recommend
          up to 3-monthly screening (38), but this has been shown to result in the consumption
          of approximately 12.1 DID of macrolides (33). In the absence of a rough
          consumption-resistance threshold, it is difficult for planners to know how to interpret
          this 12.1 DID figure. If we use the macrolide-5% thresholds outlined here, then a
          consumption of 12.1 DID macrolides could be seen as being between 5- and 9-fold
          higher than the resistance thresholds for S. pneumoniae, M. genitalium and T.
          pallidum that were found in this study.                         In the absence of any evidence from
          randomized controlled trials showing any benefit from screening (38), planners may
          use this information to reevaluate the need/frequency of chlamydia/gonorrhoea
          screening in this population. They could also use this information to justify cutting
          back screening to the PrEP clients. One option would be to visualize the macrolide
          consumption as a ‘macrolide consumption footprint' which could be compared to the
          threshold footprint (4).

          Whilst our analysis has not evaluated the extent to which macrolide resistance is
          reversible, longitudinal studies in Finland have found that a decline in macrolide
          consumption was followed by a significant decline in the frequency of erythromycin
          resistance in group A streptococcal isolates (17 to 9%) (40). Likewise, studies in
          Scotland have found that reductions in macrolide consumption were temporally
          associated with declines in the incidence of Clostridium difficile (41) and methicillin
          resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections (42). Taken in conjunction with this
          evidence, our study provides further motivation for macrolide/antimicrobial
          stewardship campaigns that strive to reduce macrolide consumption to levels at least
          below 2 DID, but if the burden of infection allows, preferably to under 1 DID as
          achieved in countries such as Sweden.
