    Abstract
    Background: Dengue and Chikungunya viruses can cause large-scale epidemics with attack
    rates exceeding 80%. In Tanzania, there have been repeated outbreaks of dengue fever, the
    most recent one in 2018 and 2019 mostly reported in coastal areas. Despite its importance,
    there is limited knowledge on epidemiology of dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) in
    Tanzania. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of DENV and CHIKV in
    Kilombero district, South-Eastern Tanzania.
    Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Kibaoni Health Center, in Kilombero district,
    in the rainy and dry seasons of 2018. Febrile patients of any age and gender were enrolled.
    Blood samples were taken and screened for DENV and CHIKV viral RNA by real-time RT-PCR
    assays.
    Results: A total of 294 patients were recruited. Most were females (65%), and aged between
    14H25 years (33%). DENV and CHIKV were detected in 29 (9.9%) and 3 (1.0%) patients,
    respectively. DENV was detected across all age groups and during both dry and rainy seasons.
    Although all four DENV serotypes were detected, serotypes 1 and 3 dominated and were
    present in 14 patients (42.4%) each. Additionally, the study showed DENV-1 and DENV-3 co-
    infections.
    Conclusion: This study reveals the co-circulation of all four DENV serotypes and CHIKV in
    Kilombero district. Importantly, we report the first occurrence of DENV-4 in Tanzania. Unlike
    previous DENV outbreaks caused by DENV-2, the 2018 outbreak was dominated by DENV-1 and
    DENV-3. Occurrence of all serotypes suggests the possibility of having severe clinical outcomes
    in future DENV epidemics in Tanzania.

    Introduction
    Dengue (DENV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses pose a significant public health threat with
    increasing geographic range and severity. There have been several acute onset large-scale
    epidemics with attack rates of DENV and CHIKV reaching 90% and 85%, respectively [1-3].
    Annually, DENV causes up to 400 million infections [4] while CHIKV has been reported in nearly
    40 countries around the world with an estimate of 2 million cases [5]. Numerous outbreaks
    have been noted in Africa, including in East-African countries such as Kenya, where outbreaks
    have been reported in 2016, 2019 and 2020 [6, 7]. The clinical manifestations of both diseases
    are similar to malaria; these include fever, rash, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
    and headache. This has led to misdiagnosis and underreporting of such infections in the
    absence of specific laboratory diagnostic testing, which remains as a major prevailing challenge
    for health systems in developing countries [8].
              The vector of transmission for both viruses is the day-biting Aedes aegypti mosquito,
    which is commonly found throughout the tropical and subtropical areas [9, 10]. The diverse
    breeding habitats for Aedes mosquitoes account for DENV and CHIKV epidemics during the dry
    seasons and contribute to urban transmission of the diseases [11-13].
              In Africa, out of the four immunogenically and genetically distinct DENV serotypes
    (DENV 1-4), DENV-2 is the most frequently documented [14-17]. Importantly, exposure to one
    DENV serotype does not confer immunity to other serotypes [18] and secondary infections by
    another serotype or mixed infections increase the risk of developing dengue hemorrhagic fever
    (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), both being potentially lethal manifestations of
    dengue [19]. The three genotypes of CHIKV are Asian, West African and East/Central/South
                                                                       3

    African (ECSA) [20]. Since its discovery in 1952 in Tanzania, there have been several reports
    from studies mostly conducted in Northern and Central Tanzania [15, 21, 22].
              In Tanzania, DENV outbreaks were reported in 2010, 2012-2014 [14, 23-25] and recently
    in 2018 and 2019 [26]. The 2014 outbreak resulted in 1,018 confirmed cases and 4 deaths
    mainly in Dar es Salaam [11], and a few confirmed cases in Kilosa district [15]. However, the
    worst documented dengue outbreak occurred in 2019 in Dar es Salaam and later in Tanga [26]
    with 6,873 cases and 13 deaths [26]. CHIKV infections on the other hand have been
    documented mostly in few districts in Northern and Central Tanzania with a prevalence ranging
    from 4% to 7% [15, 22]. Of these outbreaks, there is little information regarding the prevalence
    of the circulating DENV serotypes and CHIKV. Unfortunately, there is also lack of appropriate
    pathogen diagnosis in febrile diseases and no surveillance programs have been conducted so
    far. Therefore, sporadic cases may have occurred, but may have been undetected or
    misdiagnosed as malaria or other viral diseases because of similar clinical symptoms. The aim of
    this study was to determine the prevalence of DENV and CHIKV, including identification of
    DENV serotypes, in Kilombero district, South-eastern Tanzania.
    Methods
    Study setting
    This study was conducted in Ifakara Town Council (ITC) located in Kilombero district, South-
    eastern Tanzania. The Kilombero district is surrounded by wildlife management areas,
    rainforests and savannahs. The Kilombero River runs through the valley, creating one of the
    largest flood plains in Africa. The area has a dry season lasting from June to November, and two
    rainy seasons with heavy rains in March to May, and short rains in December and January.
    Administratively, ITC has one division subdivided into nine wards and 11 villages. Five wards are
                                                                       4

    in urban areas while four are in rural areas. This study was conducted at Kibaoni Health Center
    (KHC) located within ITC. KHC serves a population of about 106,424 people mainly from ITC and
    other parts of the Kilombero and Ulanga districts.
    Study design and population
    A cross-sectional study of patients presenting to the KHC with fever was conducted from March
    to May 2018 (rainy season) and from June to October 2018 (dry season). Eligible criteria were
    febrile patients of any age and gender with a measured axillary or rectal temperature of ≥
    37.5°C or ≥38°C, respectively. Patients were excluded from the study if they presented with
    severe illnesses that required immediate medical care, and individuals with positive malaria
    results by rapid test were excluded in the subsequent laboratory analysis.
    Sample Size
    The sample size was estimated to be 334 and was calculated with the formula reported in Naing
    et al. (2006), using a prevalence of 29% based from a study conducted in febrile patients in
    Kilosa district, located 180km from the study area [15, 27]. The assumptions for the confidence
    level and margin of error were 95% (1.96) and 5% (0.05) respectively, while contingencies such
    as recording error was 5%.
    Clinical examination and sample collection
    A trained physician at KHC obtained informed consent from eligible febrile patients.
    Information on demographics was collected using a standardized questionnaire. A physical
    examination was performed for each patient. The provisional clinical diagnosis and patient
    management was done by the hospital clinical team according to the local standard of care.
    Venous blood (5 ml from children and adults, or 2-3 ml from infants) was collected aseptically
    into EDTA vacutainer tubes for viral diagnostics. The blood was immediately transported to the
                                                                       5

    Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) laboratory for phase separation. Plasma fractions were obtained
    and stored at -80oC until analyzed.
    Laboratory analysis
    All enrolled patients were initially screened by malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) against
    malaria parasites using SD BIOLINE Malaria Ag Pf/Pan (Standard Diagnostics, Inc.) at KHC.
    Samples whose mRDT results were negative were further analyzed by DENV and CHIKV real
    time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) assays.
    Real time RT-PCRs for detection of DENV and CHIKV
    RNA was extracted from plasma samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden,
    Germany). Real-time RT-PCR kits were used for detection and differentiation of CHIKV and
    DENV 1-4 serotypes (Infectious Diseases Horizontal Technology Centre, A*STAR). The kits
    comprised of (i) Mix 1 which had specific oligonucleotide primers and Taqman probes for
    multiplex detection of DENV-1 and DENV-3, and (ii) Mix 2 with specific oligonucleotide primers
    and probes for detection of DENV-2, DENV-4 and CHIKV, and (iii) internal control (IC) targeting
    β-actin protein in each respective mix and positive controls for all four DENV serotypes and
    CHIKV. The real time RT-PCR for both Mix 1 (DENV1 and DENV3) and Mix 2 (DENV2, DENV4 and
    CHIKV) was carried out in a total reaction volume of 25 µl. For Mix 1, the final primer
    concentration (forward and reverse) for DENV-1 and DENV-3 were 0.5 µM and 0.2 µM
    respectively while probes were at 0.2 µM and 0.1 µM respectively. For Mix 2, the final primer
    concentration (forward and reverse) were 0.5 µM for DENV-2 and CHIKV and 0.2 µM for DENV-
    4 and probe concentration were at 0.2 µM for DENV-2 and CHIKV, and 0.1 µM for DENV-4. For
    the internal controls, we used 0.2 µM for both forward and reverse primers, and 0.15 µM for
    probe. Thermal cycler conditions were used as follows: reverse transcription at 50°C for 20

    95°C for 45 seconds and extension at 60°C for 1 minute 15 seconds. One step real time RT-PCR
    was performed in a Rotor Gene® Q thermocycler (Qiagen).
    Results
    A total of 294 febrile patients were recruited in this study. One third, (33.0%) were aged
    between 14H25 years, and another third (30%) were aged 26H45 years (Table 1). Most
    participants were females (65.0%) and half of them (51.7%) were recruited during the dry
    season. 184 patients (62.6%) presented at KHC with a fever duration of 1-4 days and 101
    (34.4%) had duration of 5-7 days. About half of the participants were subsistence farmers (52%)
    while 12.6% were engaging in business. The rest of the participants were students and children.
    Administratively, the majority of patients (88.1%) who visited KHC were from ITC and very few
    came from Kilombero and Ulanga districts. The main presenting symptoms were headache 136
    (46.3%) followed by coughing 131 (44.6%), malaise 66 (22.4%), diarrhea 42 (14.3%) and
    vomiting 9 (0.3%).

    10 were males (Table 2). DENV was detected in both seasons, i.e. 16 and 13 cases in rainy and
    dry seasons, respectively. DENV viral RNA copies were detected mostly in patients with fever
    duration of 1 – 4 days. In terms of location (by administration), most of the DENV patients came
    from ITC. In this study, all DENV serotypes were detected but DENV-1 and DENV-3 were more
    frequent (14 cases each), as summarized in Table 3. DENV-2 was detected in two patients while
    DENV-4 was observed in one patient. Furthermore, our findings revealed co-infection between
    DENV-1 and DENV-3 in two patients as indicated in Table 3.
              Concerning CHIKV, only 3 patients (1%) out of 294 were CHIKV RT-PCR positive. Among
    the three positives, two were males. The three patients were a 22-year-old student, a 27-year-

    Discussion
    This study reveals the presence of DENV and CHIKV among febrile patients whose blood
    samples were collected in 2018 during a DENV outbreak in the coastal area of the country. Our
    findings have demonstrated the occurrence of all four DENV serotypes as well as a co-infection
    with DENV-1 and DENV-3.
              In the present study, the 9.9% prevalence of DENV was lower than previously reported
    in Dar es Salaam in 2019 where 17 out of 20 [28]. The difference could be due to the study
    population, as the study from Dar es Salaam only involved dengue-suspected cases while the
    current study involved outpatient febrile patients from a a health center. Also, the lower
    prevalence of DENV in our study could be a result of viral RNA detection sensitivity by RT-PCR
    declining with duration of fever, and therefore we might have missed patients with >5 days
    fever duration.
              The 1% prevalence of CHIKV observed in this study is lower than that of Northern and
    Central Tanzania, where previous epidemiological studies reported a prevalence of 4 H 7% [21,
    22]. Furthermore, the low prevalence of CHIKV in Tanzania is in contrast to other countries in
    Africa (including East Africa) where outbreaks of CHIKV have been frequently reported since
    1952 with prevalence up to 53%, n=100/189, [29-32]. Our findings document the persistent
    circulation of CHIKV, supporting seroprevalence studies in other districts of Tanzania where
    anti-CHIKV antibodies (both IgM and IgG) were detected i.e. 4.7% (n=364) and 14% (n=105)
    respectively in the population, thus suggesting the endemicity of the disease [15, 33].
                                                                       10

              Unlike in the previous DENV outbreaks in Tanzania, which were mainly caused by DENV-
    2 [15, 25, 34], findings from the current study have shown that all DENV serotypes were
    circulating, with a predominance of DENV-1 and DENV-3 in the 2018 outbreak. Our results are
    in line with the findings from the study done in Dar es Salaam in 2019, which reported the co-
    circulation of DENV-1 and 3 [28]. Furthermore, DENV-1 was detected in a traveler returning
    from Tanzania to Japan in 2019 [35] and DENV-3 had been reported in Japan from a traveler
    who had visited Tanzania in 2010 [36], hence supporting its existence in the country. During the
    repeated DENV outbreaks in Tanzania, the reported disease severity was low to moderate with
    few deaths, i.e. 4 and 13 deaths in 2014 and 2018-2019 outbreaks, respectively [11]. Out of the
    four deceased cases in 2014, one had presented with DHF, and one with multiple organ failure.
    Unfortunately, no data on the DENV serotype is available from those cases [37]. With the
    increasing number of cases reported recently and the co-existence of all DENV serotypes, more
    severe disease or fatal outcomes might be observed in the future [19, 38].
              The present study was conducted at a healthcare facility serving urban and semi-urban
    communities. Most DENV-positive cases seen in this study (26 samples) were from ITC and
    occurred in both rainy and dry seasons. This is in line with other studies, which have
    demonstrated the occurrence of DENV in urban and semi-urban areas, correlating to the
    distribution of the vector A. aegypti mosquitoes [39, 40]. The surrounding wetlands in our study
    settings provide suitable breeding habitats for mosquitoes, and in addition the presence of
    short rains could further favor breeding of A. aegypti throughout the year. Thus, this increases
    the rate of CHIKV and DENV transmission.
                                                                       11

    Strengths and Limitations of the Study
    To the best of our understanding, this study is the first to show the occurrence of DENV and
    CHIKV in South-Western Tanzania. The study was conducted at a primary healthcare facility
    where most patients seek treatment and thus gives a good representation of the general
    population. However, we tested the samples by real time RT-PCR only, which might lead to
    under detection of cases with a symptom duration of more than five days. Our findings could
    be complemented by employing serological tests coupled with acute and convalescent serum,
    and isolating RNA from whole blood and urine as viral RNA persist longer in the urine.
    Conclusion
    This study has demonstrated the occurrence of all four DENV serotypes and CHIKV in Kilombero
    district, with DENV-4 being reported for the first time in Tanzania. In addition, we revealed the
    presence of co-infection with DENV-1 and 3 in one patient, possibly corresponding to a
    changing pattern of DENV serotypes from DENV-2 in the previous outbreaks to DENV-1 and
    DENV-3 in the 2018 outbreak. These findings are important in planning for future epidemics.
    We recommend further studies particularly in the identification of local vectors and
    understanding local transmission dynamics.
