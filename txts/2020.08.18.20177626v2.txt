                   We infer the infection fatality rate (IFR) of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil by combining three datasets.
                 We compute the prevalence via the population-based seroprevalence survey EPICOVID19-BR, which
                 tested 89000 people in 3 stages over a period of 5 weeks. This randomized survey selected people of
                 133 cities (accounting for 35.5% of the Brazilian population) and tested them for IgM/IgG antibodies
                 making use of a rapid test. We estimate the time delay between the development of antibodies and
                 subsequent fatality using the public SIVEP-Gripe dataset. The number of fatalities is obtained using
                 the public Painel Coronavírus dataset. We obtain the IFR via Bayesian inference for each survey
                 stage and 27 federal states. In particular, we include the effect of fading IgG levels by marginalizing
                 over the time T after contagion at which the test gives a negative result. We adopt a flat broad prior
                 on the interval [40, 80] days. We infer a country-wide average IFR of 0.85% (95% CI: 0.76–0.99%).
