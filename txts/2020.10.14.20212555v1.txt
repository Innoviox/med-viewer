   41      Multi-organ impairment in low-risk individuals with long COVID
   42      Abstract

   43      Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection
   44      has disproportionately affected older individuals and those with underlying medical
   45      conditions. Research has focused on short-term outcomes in hospital, and single organ
   46      involvement. Consequently, impact of long COVID (persistent symptoms three months post-
   47      infection) across multiple organs in low-risk individuals is yet to be assessed.

   48      Methods: An ongoing prospective, longitudinal, two-centre, observational study was
   49      performed in individuals symptomatic after recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.
   50      Symptoms and organ function (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) were assessed
   51      by standardised questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Dyspnoea-12), blood investigations and
   52      quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, defining single and multi-organ impairment by
   53      consensus definitions.

   54      Findings: Between April and September 2020, 201 individuals (mean age 44 (SD 11.0)
   55      years, 70% female, 87% white, 31% healthcare workers) completed assessments following
   56      SARS-CoV-2 infection (median 140, IQR 105-160 days after initial symptoms). The
   57      prevalence of pre-existing conditions (obesity: 20%, hypertension: 6%; diabetes: 2%; heart
   58      disease: 4%) was low, and only 18% of individuals had been hospitalised with COVID-19.
   59      Fatigue (98%), muscle aches (88%), breathlessness (87%), and headaches (83%) were the
   60      most frequently reported symptoms. Ongoing cardiorespiratory (92%) and gastrointestinal
   61      (73%) symptoms were common, and 42% of individuals had ten or more symptoms.
   62      There was evidence of mild organ impairment in heart (32%), lungs (33%), kidneys (12%),
   63      liver (10%), pancreas (17%), and spleen (6%). Single (66%) and multi-organ (25%)
   64      impairment was observed, and was significantly associated with risk of prior COVID-19
   65      hospitalisation (p<0.05).

   66      Interpretation: In a young, low-risk population with ongoing symptoms, almost 70% of
   67      individuals have impairment in one or more organs four months after initial symptoms of
   68      SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are implications not only for burden of long COVID but also
   69      public health approaches which have assumed low risk in young people with no
   70      comorbidities.

   72      Imaging through the Industry Strategy Challenge Fund, Innovate UK Grant 104688, and also

   77      Introduction
   78      Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, research and clinical interest in SARS-CoV-2 (Severe
   79      acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2)-induced organ damage was predominantly
   80      focused on the respiratory system(1). There have been indirect effects on other organ
   81      systems and disease processes, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers, through
   82      changes in health systems or behaviours of patients and health professionals(2-4). In
   83      addition, beyond an acute systemic inflammatory response, evidence for direct COVID-19-
   84      related effects on multiple organs is accumulating, with potential long-term impacts for
   85      individuals as well as health systems(5-8). However, no study to-date has included detailed
   86      characterisation of all major organ systems following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
   87
   88      COVID-19 represents a convergence of an infectious disease, under-treated non-
   89      communicable diseases and social determinants of health, as a “syndemic”(9). Pre-existing
   90      non-communicable diseases and risk factors are important predictors of poor COVID-19
   91      outcomes, whether intensive care admissions or mortality(2). Research has focused on the
   92      acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in hospitalised patients, and on individuals that have
   93      died from COVID-19(10-12). It is clear that COVID-19 can have longer multiple symptoms
   94      and long-term effects(13), but “long-COVID” is yet to be fully defined(14-15), partly due to
   95      lack of understanding of medium- and long-term pathophysiology across organ systems.
   96
   97      Long COVID in low-risk individuals, who represent up to 80% of the population(2), has public
   98      health importance in terms of burden of disease and healthcare utilisation, and therefore has
   99      urgent policy relevance across countries. However, in the UK, government policies have
 100       emphasised excess risk of mortality in moderate- and high-risk conditions, including
 101       “shielding”(2) and commissioning of a risk calculator to identify those at highest risk of
 102       COVID-19 severity and mortality(16). As the pandemic progresses, there is growing concern
 103       regarding prolonged isolation strategies for people with vulnerable conditions and at highest
 104       risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes(17). These approaches have assumed low risk of SARS-
 105       CoV-2 infection in younger individuals without underlying conditions, based on their low
 106       excess mortality, but without knowledge of the chronic pulmonary and extrapulmonary
 107       effects of COVID-19.
 108
 109       In order to better understand the long-term impact of COVID-19 and ultimately inform
 110       preventive measures at health system level, we performed a pragmatic, prospective study in
 111       low-risk individuals with symptom assessment, multi-organ magnetic resonance imaging

 112       (MRI) and blood investigations for inflammatory markers at three months post-COVID-19
 113       diagnosis.
 114       Methods
 115       Patient population and study design
 116       In an ongoing, prospective study, 201 participants were enrolled at two UK sites
 117       (Perspectum, Oxford and Mayo Clinic Healthcare, London) between April 2020 and August
 118       2020 and completed baseline assessment by 14 September 2020 (Figure 1). Participants
 119       were eligible for enrolment if they tested positive by the oro/nasopharyngeal throat swab for
 120       SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (n=62), a positive antibody
 121       test (n=63), or had typical symptoms and were determined to have COVID-19 by two
 122       independent clinicians (n=73). Exclusion criteria were symptoms of active respiratory viral
 123       infection (temperature >37.8°C or three or more episodes of coughing in 24 hours);
 124       discharged from hospital in the last 7 days; and contraindications to MRI, including implanted
 125       pacemakers, defibrillators, other metallic implanted devices; claustrophobia. The study
 126       protocol      was     approved        by    a    UK      ethics     committee        (20/SC/0185),        registered
 127       (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04369807) and all patients gave written informed
 128       consent.
 129
 130       To assess the burden of multi-organ involvement after SARS-CoV2 infection
 131       Organ function was assessed by patient-reported validated questionnaires, fasting blood
 132       investigations (as listed below) and multi-organ MRI. MRI was the chosen imaging modality
 133       (as in UK Biobank) because it is: (1) safe, with no radiation exposure, no need for
 134       intravenous contrast, minimal contact with the radiographer; (2) quantitative, repeatable and
 135       robust, with >95% acquisition and image processing success rate; (3) informative through a
 136       repository of digital data which can be shared in the research community for independent
 137       analysis and research; (4) rapid and scalable, i.e. a 35-minute scan can phenotype the lung,
 138       heart, kidney, liver, pancreas and spleen. At time of MRI, we completed (i) questionnaires for
 139       quality of life(EQ-5D-5L(18)), addressing mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain and anxiety,
 140       and breathlessness (Dyspnoea-12(19)) and (ii) full blood count, serum biochemistry (sodium,
 141       chloride, bicarbonate, urea, creatinine, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transferase,
 142       alanine      transferase,       lactate     dehydrogenase,           creatinine      kinase,      gamma-glutamyl
 143       transpeptidase, total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, uric acid,
 144       fasting triglycerides, cholesterol (total, HDL, LDL), iron, iron-binding capacity (unsaturated
 145       and total) and inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ESR; high sensitivity-
 146       C-Reactive Protein, CRP) (TDL laboratories, London).

 149       Multi-organ MRI data were collected at both study sites (Oxford: MAGNETOM Aera 1.5T,
 150       Mayo Healthcare London: MAGNETOM Vida 3T; both from Siemens Healthcare Erlangen,
 151       Germany). The COVERSCAN Multiparametic MRI assessment typically required 35mins per
 152       patient, including lungs, heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys and spleen by standardised
 153       methodology (Supplementary methods).
 154
 155       Definition of organ impairment
 156       MRI-derived measurements from the heart, lungs, kidney, liver, pancreas and spleen were
 157       compared with established reference ranges (Table S1) to determine impairment for each
 158       organ. An individual organ was classified as impaired if at least one of the metrics calculated
 159       for that organ was outside the reference range. Excessive organ fat was not considered as
 160       an indicator of impairment on the assumption that this was likely pre-existing and thus
 161       treated separately. Organ impairment was defined for each metric according to established
 162       cut-offs (Table S1) and was grouped by evidence of: borderline or low ejection fraction and
 163       evidence of myocarditis in the heart; reduced pulmonary dynamic measurements in the
 164       lungs; elevated cortical T1 in the kidneys; borderline or definite inflammation in the liver and
 165       pancreas; and splenomegaly from spleen length.
 166
 167       Statistical analysis
 168       All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 3.6.1) with a p-value less
 169       than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise
 170       baseline participant characteristics. Mean and standard deviation (SD) were used to
 171       describe normally distributed-continuous variables, median with interquartile range (IQR) for
 172       non-normally distributed, and frequency and percentage for categorical variables.
 173
 174       Mean difference in quantitative organ metrics between hospitalised versus not hospitalised
 175       were compared using the Wilcoxon test, and difference in the counts of the binary outcomes
 176       of those with evidence of organ abnormalities compared using Fisher’s test. Multi-organ
 177       impairment was defined as impairment to                   ≥2   organs. Associations between multi-organ
 178       impairment and symptoms, comorbidities and pre-existing risk factors were assessed using
 179       Spearman’s correlation. Based on the observed differences between hospitalised and non-
 180       hospitalised groups, multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess risk factors
 181       for COVID-19 hospitalisation.

 189       Results
 190       The mean age was 44.0 (SD: 11.0) years. 70% of individuals were female, 87% were white,
 191       31% were healthcare workers, 18% had been hospitalised with COVID-19. Assessment
 192       (symptoms, blood and MRI) was a median 140 (IQR 105-160) days after initial symptoms.
 193       Relevant past medical history included smoking (3%), asthma (18%), obesity (20%),
 194       hypertension (6%), diabetes (2%) and heart disease (4%). The hospitalised group were
 195       older (p=0.001), had a higher proportion of non-white participants (p=0.038), and were more
 196       likely to report ‘inability to walk’ (p=0.01) than non-hospitalised individuals. There were no
 197       other significant differences between risk factors or symptoms reported between the groups.
 198       The most commonly reported on-going symptoms (regardless of hospitalisation status) were
 199       fatigue (98%), muscle ache (88%), shortness of breath (87%) and headache (83%) (Table 1,
 200       Figure 2(a)). Ongoing cardiorespiratory (92%) and gastrointestinal (73%) symptoms were
 201       common. 99% of individuals had four or more and 42% had ten or more symptoms. 52% of
 202       patients reported persistent moderate problems undertaking usual activities (level 3 or
 203       greater in the relevant EQ-5D-5L question). 20% reported Dyspnoea-12 ≥15 (equivalent to
 204       ~3 on the MRC dyspnoea grade).
 205
 206       Blood investigations
 207       Triglycerides (p=0.002), cholesterol (p=0.021), LDL-cholesterol (p=0.005) and transferrin
 208       saturation (p=0.005) were more likely to be abnormal in hospitalised versus non-hospitalised
 209       individuals. Mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (26%), alanine transferase (14%),
 210       lactate dehydrogenase (16%), triglycerides (12%) and cholesterol (42%) were all abnormally
 211       high in ≥10% of all individuals (without separation by hospitalisation status). ESR (13%),
 212       bicarbonate (13%), uric acid (16%) and high-sensitivity CRP (13%) were abnormally high in
 213       in ≥10% of individuals in the hospitalisation group. Bicarbonate (10%), phosphate (13%), uric
 214       acid (11%), and transferrin saturation (19%) were abnormally low in                          ≥10%     of individuals
 215       (without separation by hospitalisation status) (Table S2).
 216
 217       Single and multi- organ impairment
 218       Impairment was present in the heart in 32% (myocarditis in 11%; systolic dysfunction in
 219       23%), lungs in 33%, kidneys in 12%, liver in 10%, pancreas in 17%, and 6% had evidence of
 220       splenomegaly (Table 2, Figure 2(b)). 66% of individuals had impairment in one or more
 221       organ systems. There was evidence of multi-organ impairment in 25% of individuals, with
 222       varying degrees of overlap across multiple organs (Figure 1 and 3). Organ impairment was

 223       more common in hospitalised versus non-hospitalised individuals. Measures of inflammation
 224       in the kidneys and pancreas, and ectopic fat in the pancreas and liver, were also higher in
 225       hospitalised individuals (all p <0.05)(Figure 2(b)).
 226
 227       Association between symptoms, blood investigations and organ impairment
 228       Figure 4 shows the percentage of reported symptoms in those with organ impairment (per
 229       organ). Multi-organ involvement was associated with more serious symptoms (fatigue,
 230       breathlessness etc), but no clear pattern was observed linking symptoms to organ
 231       impairment. Regression analysis did not show any association between specific organ
 232       impairment and specific symptoms or blood investigations. Increasing age (OR: 1.06 [CI:
 233       1.02-1.10], p< 0.01), increased liver volume (OR: 1.18 [CI: 1.06-1.30], p<0.001) and having
 234       multi-organ impairment (OR: 2.75 [CI:1.22-6.22], p <0.05), all significantly increased the
 235       likelihood of being hospitalized, adjusting for gender and BMI.

 263       Discussion
 264       In the first study to-date evaluating medium-term impairment across multiple organs
 265       following SARS-CoV2 infection, we had three major findings. First, in young individuals,
 266       largely without risk factors, pre-existing disease or hospitalisation, there was significant
 267       symptom burden and evidence of heart, lung, liver and pancreas impairment four months
 268       post-COVID-19. Second, symptoms and blood investigations predicted neither organ
 269       impairment nor hospitalisation. Third, cardiac (myocarditis and systolic dysfunction) and lung
 270       impairment have similar prevalence in low-risk individuals with long COVID.

 272       The short-term symptoms likely to predict COVID-19(20) persist four months post-infection,
 273       particularly fatigue, shortness of breath, myalgia, headache and arthralgia. In this young
 274       cohort with low prevalence of comorbidities, the extent of symptom burden and organ
 275       impairment is concerning. Models of population COVID-19 impact have been based on age,
 276       underlying conditions and mortality, excluding morbidity or potential for multi-organ
 277       impairment and chronic diseases(21, 22). Moreover, studies highlighting extrapulmonary
 278       COVID-19 manifestations emphasised acute phase of illness(20). Although we describe mild
 279       rather than severe organ impairment, the pandemic’s scale and high infection rates in lower
 280       risk individuals (by age and underlying conditions), suggest a medium- and longer- term
 281       impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection which cannot be ignored in healthcare or policy spheres.
 282
 283       Although there may be an immunologic basis for variations in progression and severity of
 284       SARS-CoV-2 infection in different individuals(24), prediction models to-date have high rates
 285       of bias and poor performance(25). We found clustering of cardiorespiratory and
 286       gastrointestinal symptoms with evidence of impairment in heart, liver and pancreas
 287       respectively, but blood investigations were not associated with particular patterns of organ
 288       impairment as determined by COVERSCAN multi-organ assessment. Neither symptoms nor
 289       blood investigations were predictive of organ impairment. In acutely unwell patients, the
 290       focus has been on recognition of respiratory dysfunction and early provision of ventilatory
 291       support, but chronic multi-organ function has not been described systematically. Ongoing
 292       studies are considering chronic impact of COVID-19(26) but excluding non-hospitalised, low-
 293       risk individuals with and without organ impairment, which we will be investigating further in
 294       the longer term. As well as interest in specialist long COVID clinical services(27), there is a
 295       role for multi-organ assessment and ongoing evaluation, including low-risk, non-hospitalised
 296       individuals, perhaps even in the absence of symptoms.

 297
 298       Acute myocarditis and cardiogenic shock have been described(28), as well as high
 299       prevalence of myocarditis in hospitalised COVID-19 patients(29). In American athletes,
 300       although recent COVID-19 was associated with myocarditic changes, many non-infected
 301       patients also showed these changes(30). We now add that one third of low-risk individuals
 302       with long COVID syndrome have cardiac impairment in the form of mild systolic dysfunction
 303       or myocarditis three months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whilst causality cannot be
 304       attributed, cardiac function can be viewed as a risk factor for severe infection and an
 305       explanation of persistent symptoms in long COVID. As longitudinal data across organs
 306       become available, potential significance of our findings in the liver, kidney and pancreas
 307       needs to be explored.

 308       Implications for research
 309       Our findings at four months post-infection and future findings have three research
 310       implications. First, as countries face second pandemic waves, models of the pandemic’s
 311       impact must include long COVID, whether quality of life, healthcare utilisation, productivity
 312       and economic effects. Second, there is urgent need for further multi-organ assessment,
 313       including blood and imaging analysis in the COVID-19 context, as well as linkage with
 314       primary and secondary care data, so that long COVID can be properly defined. Third, further
 315       longitudinal investigation of clustering of symptoms and organ impairment will inform health
 316       services research to plan multidisciplinary care pathways.

 317       Implications for clinical practice and public health
 318       There are three implications for COVID-19 management. First, as well as highlighting the
 319       potential for MRI across organ systems following SARS-CoV-2 infection, our findings signal
 320       the need for monitoring and follow-up in at least the medium- and longer-term, especially for
 321       extrapulmonary sequelae. Second, as the search for effective COVID-19 vaccines and
 322       treatments continues, potential and real long-term multi-organ consequences of SARS-CoV-
 323       2 infection in low-risk individuals reinforce the central importance of minimising infection
 324       through social distancing, wearing of masks, physical isolation and other population-level
 325       measures. Third, both in terms of managing baseline risk, and monitoring and treating
 326       complications across organ systems, long COVID requires management across specialities
 327       (e.g. cardiology,        gastroenterology)         and     disciplines (e.g. communicable                 and non-
 328       communicable diseases).

 329       Strengths and limitations
 330       Our study is an ongoing, prospective, longitudinal cohort study with detailed blood and
 331       imaging characterisation of organ function, despite limited clinical examination with video
 332       consultations in the era of COVID-19. By recruiting ambulatory patients after infection with

 333       broad inclusion criteria (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 testing by virus RNA, antibody or antigen), we
 334       focus on individuals at lower risk of severity and mortality from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.
 335       Our cardiac MRI protocol excluded gadolinium contrast as concerns regarding COVID-19-
 336       related renal complications remain. We relied on native T1 mapping to detect and
 337       characterise myocardial inflammation, allowing non-invasive tissue characterisation which
 338       was previously evaluated as superior to gadolinium MRI for acute myocarditis(31).
 339
 340       We report baseline findings following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our pragmatic study design,
 341       the diagnosis of COVID-19 was by multiple methods, partly limited by access to laboratory
 342       testing during the pandemic. Causality of the relationship between organ impairment and
 343       infection cannot be deduced, but may be addressed by longitudinal follow-up of individuals
 344       with    organ     impairment.        Our    study population           was     limited    by    ethnicity despite
 345       disproportionate impact of COVID-19 in non-white individuals. Pulse oximetry and spirometry
 346       were added later to the protocol and follow up; they were not included from the outset to limit
 347       interaction and exposure between trial team and patients. We did not include healthy
 348       controls or MRI assessment of brain or muscle function.
 349

 350       Conclusions
 351       Long COVID has a physiological basis, with measurable patient-reported outcomes and
 352       organ impairment. Medium- and long-term evaluation and monitoring of multi-organ function
 353       beyond symptoms and blood investigations is likely to be required, even in lower risk
 354       individuals. Health system responses should emphasise suppression of population infection
 355       rates, as well as management of pre- and post-COVID-19 risk factors and chronic diseases.

 410       Research in Context
 411
 412       Evidence before this study
 413       We searched PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, and Wellcome Open Research for peer-
 414       reviewed articles, preprints, and research reports on long COVID syndrome and medium-
 415       and long-term impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), using the search terms
 416       “coronavirus”, “COVID-19”, and similar terms, “organ impairment”, “organ function” and
 417       “morbidity”, up to September 30, 2020. We found no prior studies of medium- or long-term
 418       multi-organ impairment due to COVID-19. Prior studies have considered acute phase of
 419       illness and hospitalised patients, focusing on “high-risk” individuals based on age and
 420       underlying conditions. Without longer term data including lower risk individuals, full
 421       population impact of the pandemic cannot be assessed and health system responses cannot
 422       be planned.
 423
 424       Added value of this study
 425       In 201 individuals with low risk for COVID-19 severity and mortality (mean age 44 years,
 426       20% obesity, 6% hypertension, 2% diabetes and 4% heart disease, 18% hospitalised), we
 427       assessed symptoms, blood investigations and multi-organ magnetic resonance imaging
 428       across organ systems, four months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. 99% and 42% had ≥4
 429       and ≥10 symptoms respectively. Mild organ impairment was present in at least one organ in
 430       66% and in 2 or more organs in 25% of individuals. Multi-organ impairment was associated
 431       with hospitalisation.
 432
 433       Implications of all the available evidence
 434       These analyses support strategies to suppress and minimise the infection rate in the
 435       population; medium- and long-term follow-up after SARS-CoV-2 infection with detailed
 436       evaluation across organ systems; and management of underlying conditions and risk factors
 437       before and after infection. For the first time, we provide multi-organ assessment in young,
 438       low-risk individuals with long COVID to inform healthcare and policy responses.
