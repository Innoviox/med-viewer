       ABSTRACT
       The global COVID-19 pandemic has spread across various continents in diverse methods
       and speed while opening up discussion for technological and scientific questions
       pertaining methodology of testing accuracy among diverse viral strains.
       On the issue of testing sensitivity and accuracy, RT-PCR is commonly viewed as a
       standard testing protocol globally as the predominant accurate testing method vis-à-vis
       other rapid methods. However, each country’s infectious disease authority has established
       its own primers/probe sets guidelines and protocols, thereby, the global testing
       community lacks a “Standardized Universal Primer(s)” (SUP) that is foolproof for the
       COVID-19 patients among various populations today. As a result, RT-PCR testing
       accuracy and results may vary depending on which primer was used, most likely resulting
       in false negative and/or false positive calls associated with RT-PCR testing.
       In this study, a comparative study between primers from different countries’ disease
       control centers was conducted. 11,652 samples from Japanese population were tested for
       SARS-CoV-2 positive using recommended RT-PCR primers/probe sets from Japan
       National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID) and US Centers for Disease Control and
       Prevention (CDC).

       Results:
       Of the 102 positive samples, 17 samples (16.7% of total positives) showed inconsistent
       results when tested for the following primers: JPN-N2, JPN-N1, CDC-N1, and CDC-N2.
       In addition, CDC recommended primer/probe sets showed relatively higher sensitivity
       and accuracy among the primer/probe sets used for the detection of
       SARS-CoV-2 positive clones.
       Conclusion:
       Due to the inconsistency in the positive/negative results for JPN-N2, JPN-N1,
       CDC-N1, and CDC-N2 primer/probe sets, SARS-CoV-2 samples run via RT-PCR
       will result in false negative/positive subjected to differences in virus mutation in a
       specific sequence region targeted by a primer. This outcome shows that the use of
       JPN-N2 primer combined with CDC-N2 primer produces the most effective result
       to reduce false negatives in Japan region. Furthermore, adding CDC-N1 will result
       in reducing false negatives, but also false positives. Further investigation remains
       open for confirmation whether similar irregular pattern occur with primers
       targeting other regions such as E or ORF1ab in order to isolate false negatives
       and/or positives in future PCR testing for COVID-19.

       INTRODUCTION
       There are two commonly known factors associated with inaccurate testing results for
       COVID-19 using RT-PCR testing. First is the failure to retrieve sufficient amounts of
       viral RNA typically associated with the timing of when the sample is administered or the
       method of how a sample is collected. For example, a nasopharyngeal swab may be unable
       to obtain sufficient amounts of RNA if it does not come in contact at a nasal position
       where the presence of the virus is concentrated. In the case of saliva collection kit, use
       during the first several days of viral contact may result in insufficient amounts of RNA.

       For both nasopharyngeal swab and saliva kit, low amounts of RNA occurring at later
       stage among discharged or recovering patients has tendency to show extremely low RNA
       count. While many countries have issued a standard 14-day quarantine, Genesis
       Healthcare, a licensed clinical laboratory in Tokyo, Japan, has confirmed through tested
       samples where the recovering and discharged patient is still testing positive after 14 day
       despite low RNA count. Though this confirmation does not necessarily imply that the
       patient is infectious after 14 days of quarantine as observed in a study [8], while the test
       result remains positive, it supports recent study which outlines the long duration of the
       RNA-positive tail and calls for reconsideration of containment strategy [9].
       The second factor, and most technologically challenging, is the lack of a standardized
       international testing method for COVID-19 using a set of common primer(s) among
       different nations/populations or hereby referred to as SUP. Different primers used by
       different country’s testing protocols prevent the accurate testing among asymptomatic as
       well as symptomatic patients associated with false positives and false negative reporting.
       In this paper, the RT-PCR result discrepancy for SARS-CoV-2 testing is summarized and
       compared among different primers recommended by NIID and CDC. Further, virus
       mutation as a plausible cause of discrepancy is investigated and discussed.
       METHODS
       Study Design:
       Japan’s COVID-19 RT-PCR public health observation is unique in that while Wuhan,
       China was locked down from January 23, 2020 till April 8th, 2020, Japan’s border was
       still open to remainder of China until March 9th, 2020 and to US and Europe until March
       26, 2020. This time gap in closing the international border leaves an inquiry that COVID-
       19 could have possibility entered Japan at different times from both East and West.

        Figure 2. A RT-PCR results for JPN-N2 and JPN-N1 primer/probe sets: JPN-N2 shows relatively
                higher signal intensity compared to JPN-N1 and the rising curve starts at 25 cycles
                                                for SARS-CoV-2 positive samples.
       JPN-N2 has seen consistently higher primer sensitivity than JPN-N1. As a result, it is
       sought that NIID later eliminated JPN-N1 to only reflect JPN-N2 in calling positive
       samples.
       Due to the continuing dialogue by the medical community to retest samples whose results
       were not considered to reflect patient’s symptoms, testing JPN-N1 was continued and
       CDC-N1 and CDC-N2, both of which are located in nucleocapsid region N of SARS-
       CoV-2, were added to identify whether JPN-N2 primer was adequate to identify COVID-
       19 positive cases for all samples.

       Sample Collection:
       All COVID-19 positive testing samples were obtained between April, 2020 and August,
       2020 and were either obtained from saliva or nasopharyngeal test kits. The
       nasopharyngeal testing included two swabs per person and were administered to
       maximize virus collection to rule out miscalling due to low RNA count. Both
       nasopharyngeal and saliva samples were immediately immersed in RNA preservation
       solution after extraction to inactivate the virus while maintaining RNA stability during
       transport. Samples were delivered to the Genesis Healthcare’s PCR testing facility within
       24 hours at temperatures between 20° and 27° Celsius. All samples’ RNA extraction was
       immediately conducted followed by RT-PCR test. The entire RNA extraction to RT-PCR
       testing process was completed within 6 hours of receipt at the same laboratory using the
       below testing method.
       COVID-19 RNA Collection Method, Extraction and RT-PCR Testing Method:
       Saliva samples were collected using saliva RNA sample collection kit by Zeesan Biotech
       Co., Ltd. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected using virus RNA sample
       collection kit by Zeesan Biotech Co., Ltd. Saliva samples were added 0.5 ml 20% DTT
       to remove viscosity, vortex and incubate at 50° Celsius for 10 minutes, then centrifuged
       at 1,500 rpm for 10 minutes.

       180 μl of supernatant of DTT-treatment saliva samples and 180 μl of nasopharyngeal
       swab suspension were used for RNA extraction. RNA extraction was performed by
       MGISP-960 system (MGI Tech Co., Ltd). RT-qPCR for specific amplification of the
       N gene or E gene of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using LightCycler480
       systemⅡ(Roche Diagnostics K.K.). Final reaction volume was 12.5 μl, including 2.0
       μl of RNA template, 6.25 μl of One Step PrimeScript III RT-qPCR Mix (TAKARA
       BIO INC.) , and forward primer, reverse primer and probe (primer and probe sequence,
       final concentration was shown in Table 1.
       The cycling conditions consisted of RT at 50° Celsius for 5 minutes, initial denaturation
       at 95° Celsius for 10 sec, and 45 cycles of denaturation at 95° Celsius for 5 seconds and
       annealing/extension at 60° Celsius for 30 seconds.
       RESULTS
       All samples were tested simultaneously for JPN-N2, JPN-N1, CDC-N2, and CDC-N1
       primer/probe set (Note: As of May, 2020, the Japanese testing protocol for COVID-19
       is only JPN-N2 as announced by the Japan’s NIID).

       However, Table 3 depicts that among the 17 samples which were tested negative for
       JPN-N2, 12 samples were tested positive for CDC-N2 primer/probe set while negative
       for CDC-N1, 4 samples tested positive for both CDC-N1 and CDC-N2. Furthermore, one
       sample was tested positive for CDC-N1 while negative for CDC-N2 (Figure 3-5).
       These 17 “test result irregularities”, which accounts for 16.7% of total 102 positive
       sample pool would be declared negative if a laboratory only tested JPN-N2. This high
       rate of irregular occurrence stemming from 1 primer/probe can be considered as one of
       the major causes leading to false negatives that are often reported in association with
       COVID-19 testing accuracy. Furthermore, from the observation above, a combination of
       multiple primers, in this case, a combination of JPN-N2 and CDC-N2 primer shows the
       highest rate of accuracy and sensitivity compared to JPN-N2 primer alone, followed by a
       triple combination of JPN-N-2, CDC-N2 and CDC-N1 for the Japanese population. These
       combinations, however, may change with various COVID-19 strands that could exist in
       other populations and further investigation is necessary to identify the optimum
       combination of primers for the Japanese population as cross-border travel brings different
       COVID-19 strands that react to different primers.
       Sample Observation of RT-PCR Data of Irregular Samples:
       Below are several examples of unique and irregular samples and its RT-PCR data that
       could serve as future hypothesis for identifying and detecting the causes of false testing
       results.

       In the first case, samples reacted only to the CDC-N2 primer but not to the JPN primers.
       One of the most problematic cases observed are the samples whereby JPN-N2 primer
       resulted in negative albeit responding positive to CDC-N2 or CDC-N1 primers. Since
       Japanese testing protocol for COVID-19 is JPN-N2 alone, registered Japanese clinical
       laboratories are expected to call based on N2 primer result. However, in instances such
       as these, the importance to provide additional information regarding the test result for
       CDC is recognized and attending physicians are strongly urged to retest the patient
       again via RT-PCR or utilize other testing methods such as CT Scan and antigen. This
       would diminish the risk of misinformation and potentially spread of the infection to
       others for patients, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic.
        Figure 4. A Japanese sample that was negative for JPN-N2 but positive for CDC-N2 and CDC-N1.
       Among the 4 primers and probe, only CDC-N2 reacted as positive response at late cycle
       (40x). This patient (male patient A) became symptomatic 14 days before testing and upon
       taking PCR test on day 5, tested positive. After 1 week of quarantine and the public health
       office has lifted his self-quarantine, he voluntarily retested to reconfirm his status. His
       results showed that his test result would be negative under Japan NIID’s JPN-N2

       CDC-N2 and would be declared positive if this person were to be tested at a laboratory
       in the US, where CDC-N2 is the standard protocol.

       DISCUSSION
       There are numerous factors that could affect RT-PCR result discrepancy, ranging from
       sample collection method, collection timing, virus inactivation technique, and many other
       RT-PCR procedures. However, given that the testing protocol strictly follows NIID and
       CDC testing guideline and protocol, that left viral diversity as a strong candidate for the
       irregularities.
       It’s hypothesized that various virus strands align differently to different primers used
       globally due to its unique sequence. Specifically, at the time of analysis, there are 15,745
       SARS-CoV-2 sequences submitted to NCBI GenBank [1] where each sequence contains
       different combination of variants/mutations. Therefore, to further validate our assumption,
       the virus mutation data and primers oligonucleotide sequences are investigated.
       Primers vs. Viral Genetic Variations:
       In an effort to try to explore the primer(s) effectiveness in current virus variations, an
       exploratory data analysis has been conducted over 84 virus strands from Japan, retrieved
       from NCBI GenBank genetic sequence database as of August 28, 2020.

       From extracted Japan’s samples, a phylogeny tree was generated using tool from NCBI
       Virus [2]. The resulting tree shows different clades connected in hierarchies, suggesting
       that there are different virus mutations in the geographical region. Next, a sequence
       alignment using primers nucleotide from different countries against all coronavirus 2
       strands from Japan was performed, using Blastn. The alignment results are then filtered
       to contain only perfect consecutive alignment of all nucleotides, meaning identities must
       be exactly equal to the length of primer oligonucleotide sequence with no gap. With such
       a rigid filter, the number of alignment matches were visualized using iTOL [3] and many
       virus strands those do not match with some primers are found as shown in Figure 10.
           Figure 10. 84 SARS-CoV-2 sequences identified for Japanese COVID samples with primers
                                     locations where false negatives will most likely occur.
       The finding also coincides with other study [7] reporting that of 33 oligonucleotides
       developed by different centers and shared by WHO, 79% (26) has at least one genome
       mutation at the primer binding sites from GISAID database containing 1,825 SARS-
       CoV-2 genomes.
       While one dominant strand will test positive for a specific primer, there are irregularities
       that will not display positive for another primer, most likely resulting in false negative
       calls. In this respect, laboratories should examine their primers against all known viral
       genome sequences to ensure that the selected primers will not result in inaccurate
       calling.

       CONCLUSION
       The conflicting positive/negative results from the same samples that occur among
       different primers (JPN-N2, JPN-N1, CDC-N2, CDC-N1) outline 1) the possibility of high
       occurrences of false negative testing results by laboratories where JPN-N2 is the only
       primer used for SARS-CoV-2, and 2) the probability that false negative/positive will
       likely occur when the primer binding site lies in the virus mutated location for JPN-N2
       and CDC-N2.
       This initial observation also suggests testing CDC-N2 in addition to JPN-2 primer,
       especially for symptomatic patients, with the objective to reduce false negatives and
       increase accuracy. Lastly, the inclusivity of CDC-N1 will result further in reducing false
       negatives but using CDC-N1 alone may also result in false positive calling and therefore
       should not be used without either JPN-N2 or CDC-N2.
       Further investigation by sequencing these irregular samples will identify which primers
       react to different strands of COVID-19 existing among different populations. Secondly,
       these irregularities raise the need for the international testing community to explore a
       standardized universal primers/probe sets combination for more accurate RT-PCR-based
       COVID-19 testing, which shall help to detect different strand’s reaction to selected
       primers by each country’s testing protocol. This is a critical consideration to ensure
       accurate diagnostic testing results entailing public health and safety. While more countries
       are re-opening their borders and resuming international travel to sustain the economic
       growth, this may also lead to the introduction of new strands to different populations
       furthering the demand for SUP.
