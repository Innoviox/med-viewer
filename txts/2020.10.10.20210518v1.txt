    Abstract
    Objectives: The Risk of Bias (RoB) and other characteristics of randomized clinical trials
    included in Cochrane oral health systematic reviews were assessed.
    Study Design and Settings: All the trials included in Cochrane oral health systematic reviews
    were examined. The RoB was evaluated for all the included clinical trials according to the
    Cochrane review standards. The Overall Risk of Bias (ORoB) was defined in this study based on
    the criteria for determining the overall bias in Cochrane's RoB tool-v2. Descriptive analyses
    were carried out to determine the frequency of each intended variable.
    Results: A total of 2565 studies were included in our analysis. The majority of the studies
    (n=1600) had sample sizes of 50 or higher. As for blinding, 907 studies were labelled as double-
    blind. Performance bias showed the highest rate of high risk (31.4%). Almost half of the studies
    had a high ORoB compared to 11.1% with low ORoB. The studies that used placebos had higher
    low ORoB (14.8% vs. 10.7%). The double-blind studies had the highest low ORoB (23.6%). The
    studies with a cross-over design had the highest low ORoB (28.8%).
    Conclusion: Overall, the RoB for the studies on dentistry and oral health in Cochrane reviews
    was deemed high.

    Introduction
    The quality assessment of studies should always consider both internal and external validities
    (1), which are critical aspects of any scientific project, although internal validity is more relevant
    to empirical studies (2). The Risk of Bias (RoB) is a good measure of the internal validity of a
    study (3, 4). Bias in clinical studies leads to the over- or under-estimation of treatment outcomes
    (5). From a clinical perspective, bias can lead to the application of an intervention that may not
    be effective or that may even be potentially harmful (3). While Randomized Clinical Trials
    (RCTs) are widely considered the gold standard for therapeutic clinical research to measure the
    effectiveness of new medical interventions (6), they are also prone to bias (6).
    The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews is proposed as the biggest and most recognized
    scientific database of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in health sciences that publishes
    high-quality systematic reviews with specific methodological protocols (7). In the case of RoB,
    Cochrane reviews use a specific domain-based evaluation tool that has been changed over the
    past years, with the latest edition introduced in 2008 (8). Currently, the domains consist of
    'sequence generation', 'allocation concealment', 'blinding of participants and personnel', 'other
    potential threats to validity (other sources of bias)', 'blinding of outcome assessment (blinding of
    the examiner)', 'incomplete outcome data', and 'selective outcome reporting'. Cochrane's
    evaluation tool for RoB is a signposting scale with three variations, namely, 'Low-risk', 'High-
    risk' and 'Unclear-risk'. The first two variations are self-explanatory, and the unclear-risk choice
    is assigned when there is not enough evidence available (reported by the study) to explicitly
    draw a conclusion about any specific domain. The primary sources of support and reliance for
    Cochrane judgments are pieces of evidence or quotes from the appraised paper or any rational
    inferences and reviews drawn from the author's explanations (9).

    Despite all the invaluable efforts made in the past few years, there is still a considerable gap
    between the available evidence and the common clinical procedures in dentistry (10). As a result,
    in many cases, it may be difficult for practitioners to extract their needed data from the relevant
    studies (11). Moreover, there are also studies with inadequate allocation concealment and high
    RoB, which tend to change empirical results in a clinical setting (12). Without a way to offer
    dentists high-quality evidence to reinforce their decision-making process, dentists will be faced
    with substantial stress and their decision-making will become more time-consuming in clinical
    settings. The present study aimed to assess the RoB and other characteristics of the RCTs
    included in Cochrane oral health systematic reviews on the subject of dentistry and oral health.
    Further suggestions to be considered by future Cochrane review teams will be presented toward
    the end.
    Methods
    This study is a secondary analysis of the data provided in Cochrane oral health systematic
    reviews. All the judgements concerning the quality of the RCTs have been made by Cochrane
    review authors.
    Search strategy
    The "dentistry and oral health" filter was used to search Cochrane Library's "Search Reviews
    (CDSR)" section on June 1, 2020. All the reviews in this category were included in the data
    extraction step.

    Identification and selection of primary studies
    The primary studies were identified using the references included in the systematic reviews and
    their data were extracted by the characteristics of the included studies' tables. Figure 1 shows the
    detailed flow diagram of steps taken to choose the eligible studies.
    Data extraction and management
    This phase of the study was carried out for all the included trials by seven independent authors
    (AS-M, PI, MS, ES, HM, SN, PM), and the results were entered directly into preformatted Excel
    2016 spreadsheets. All the spreadsheets were then merged into one file and rechecked to avoid
    any mistakes and inconsistencies among the data extractors (AS-M, PI, MS). The items intended
    to be extracted were divided into three categories: (1) Basic information on the RCTs, e.g. title,
    first author, year of publication, etc.; (2) The information reported in the RCTs (the
    "Characteristics of the included studies" section), which basically characterized the main
    methodological features of each RCT; and 3) The RoB assessment of the RCTs.
    Given that the blinding process was evaluated differently by the Cochrane review authors, the
    RoB assessments were performed by different trajectories. In some studies, blinding took place
    in two subgroups, i.e. blinding of the participants and personnel (performance bias) and blinding
    of the outcome assessment (detection bias); meanwhile, in some other studies, blinding was
    taken as one item. In rare instances, blinding took place in two categories, including subjective
    and objective outcomes or a range, namely, assessor, analyst, participants, and caregivers. In
    these cases, an aggregated form was provided; if one or more subcategories were reported as
    high-risk, the whole category of blinding bias was considered high-risk, and if all were at a low

    risk, the whole category was considered low-risk; otherwise, the blinding bias was reported as
    unclear.
    There were some other RoB assessment items that were rarely reported; for instance, funding
    bias, intention to treat bias, sample size bias, for-profit bias, and power calculation bias. Due to
    the low frequency of these items, these kinds of biases were not extracted in this study.
    Additionally, a new variable was defined to aggregate the full results of the assessments, named
    the "Overall Risk of Bias" (ORoB). The criteria for determining the ORoB were the same as
    those of the "Overall Bias" assessment in Cochrane's RoB tool -version 2 (13). If any of the bias
    domains were considered high-risk, the ORoB was considered high. In the absence of high-risk
    biases, unclear-risk-assessed biases were perceived in the same way; otherwise, the ORoB was
    considered low. The RCTs that appeared in more than one Cochrane review were excluded if
    their RoB assessments were not consistent.
    In including RCTs in this study, several groups were considered, namely, quasi-experimental
    (controlled before-after, interrupted time series, and non-randomized designs), parallel RCT,
    crossover RCT, cluster RCT, split-mouth RCT, and repeated-measures study designs.
    Finally, to scrutinise the Cochrane review authors’ subjectiveness and bias of judgement, the
    studies were distinguished by RoB domains. Cochrane reviews that included the same studies,
    either with the same or with different RoB assessments, were listed and signposted in different
    categories based on the included titles.
    Statistical analysis
    The extracted data were analysed using R v3.6.0 (2019-04-26) (R Core Team, R Foundation for
    Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. http://www.r-project.org), and mean and standard

    qualitative data.
    Results
    Characteristics of Cochrane Reviews
    Of the 8293 Cochrane reviews on the subject, 203 (2.4%) were on dentistry and oral health (23rd
    rank among the subjects in terms of the number of reviews). The majority of the reviews were
    interventional (99.0%) and there were two diagnostic studies. The review subjects were mainly
    concerned with dental caries (24.6%), craniofacial anomalies (18.7%), and oral and maxillofacial
    surgery (15.8%). Seventeen reviews (8.4%) included zero studies and 33 (16.3%) reviews were
    withdrawn for different reasons, mainly because of being out-of-date (75.8%) and not meeting
    the current Cochrane methodological standards (54.5%). Nonetheless, ten of the withdrawn
    studies were included as they were still methodologically sound. Besides, two reviews included
    only observational studies. Hence, 159 interventional reviews (80.3%) provided the data needed
    for this study.
    The mean and median of the number of the studies included in these reviews were 18.7
    (SD=26.0) and 10 (range: 1-154), respectively. Four reviews (4/203, 2.0%) had more than 100
    included studies and 80 (80/203, 39.4%) had less than ten (excluding the zero-including studies).
    The subjects of three most-cited reviews were oral cancer and pre-cancerous lesions (N=309),
    oral and maxillofacial surgery (N=305), and dental caries (N=275) according to Web of Science.
    Nonetheless, reviews about antibiotic therapy (78.5, N=2), oral lichen planus (73.5, N=2), and
    periodontal diseases (69.6, N=17) had the highest mean number of citations.

    Characteristics of the included studies
    The reviews included 2811 studies in which 246 were duplicated. Therefore, a total of 2565
    studies were included in our analysis. Almost two-thirds of these studies (n=1666) were
    published after 2000. The distribution of the location where the studies were conducted was quite
    heterogeneous. The USA, the UK, and India had the highest number of studies with 588 (22.9%),
    221 (8.6%), and 164 (6.4%) studies, respectively. Sixty-eight studies were conducted using
    international collaborations. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the location of the studies.
    Out of the 614 study sources, four were unpublished and one was a dissertation from the
    University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. However, 117 journals had more than three studies included in
    the Cochrane reviews. Most of these journals were published in the USA (47.9%) and the UK
    (26.4%). According to the SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) quartiles (2019), over half of these
    journals were categorized as Q1 (52.1%), followed by Q2 (25.6%). The most frequent subjects of
    the journals were dentistry (miscellaneous; 41.0%), followed by medicine (miscellaneous;
    10.3%) and oral surgery (10.3%). The following journals represented the highest inclusions in
    the Cochrane reviews: Journal of Clinical Periodontology (n=108, 4.2%), and Journal of
    Periodontology (n=103, 4.0%), and Journal of the American Dental Association (n=67, 2.6%).
    The majority of the studies (n=1600, 62.4%) had sample sizes of 50 or higher. The mean and
    median of the sample sizes were 1017 (SD=3875.1) and 303 (range: 3-191873), respectively, and
    86 studies had sample sizes higher than 1000. In contrast, 4.3% of the studies had less than 20
    participants. The sample size was not reported in the tables in 17 studies.

    More than three-fourths of the included studies were parallel RCTs (n=2040), followed by split-
    mouth (n=253), cross-over (n=154), and quasi-experimental (n=72) studies. The design was
    unclear in one study.
    From a methodological point of view, 787 (30.7%) studies reported that they had one arm as the
    control group that received placebo. As for blinding, 907 (35.3%) studies were labelled as
    double-blinded, 60 studies (2.4%) as triple-blinded, and 425 (16.6%) studies had not used any
    blinding in their design. The number of double- and triple-blinded studies was 967, and 791 of
    them (81.8%) had low risks in terms of performance bias.
    Mostly all the domains of the RoB tool were assessed in all the reviews. However, in 45 (1.8%)
    and 11 (0.4%) of the interventional studies, respectively, random sequence generation and
    allocation concealment were not assessed by the reviewers. Among the various domains of bias,
    performance bias (blinding of the participants and personnel) showed the highest rate of high risk
    (31.4%). Instead, other sources of bias had the highest rate of low risk (68.2%). Figure 3 presents
    the overall assessment of each domain of the RoB tool. According to Figure 4, random sequence
    generation data has continuously improved in terms of increasing low RoB during 2000-2019.
    One hundred and forty-four studies had appeared in more than one Cochrane review (out of a
    total of 390 studies), with inconsistent RoB assessments in 107 (74.3%) of them. The assessment
    of attrition bias (incomplete outcome data; n=207, 53.1%) and selection bias (allocation
    concealment; n=34, 8.7%) had the highest and lowest rates of disagreement between the different
    reviews, respectively.

    The Overall Risk of Bias (ORoB) and its association with the study
    characteristics
    After removing the duplicate studies that had not reached consistent assessments concerning the
    RoBs (determined in the Cochrane reviews), 2458 studies remained for calculating the ORoB.
    Near half of these studies (n=1119) had a high ORoB compared to 11.9% (n=294) with a low
    ORoB.
    The following journals showed the highest percentage of studies with low ORoBs (considered
    eligible with at least ten included studies): The European Journal of Oral Implantology (73.1% of
    26 studies), Journal of Endodontics (52.3%, of 44 studies), and Anesthesia Progress (38.5%, of
    13 studies). The following journals showed the highest percentage of studies with high ORoBs
    (considered eligible with at least ten included studies): Journal of Dentistry for Children (91.7%
    of 12 studies), European Archives of Paediatric Dentistry (81.8%, of 11 studies), and Cancer
    (74.2%, of 31 studies).
    Among the countries with more than 50 included studies, Italy and China had the highest
    percentage of low (32 out of 155, 20.6%) and high (49 out of 89, 55.1%) ORoBs, respectively.
    Of the 821 studies conducted before the year 2000, 6.6% had low ORoBs, compared to 14.5% of
    those conducted after 2000 and 15.5% of those conducted after 2010. The studies that used
    placebos had higher percentages of low ORoB (14.8% vs. 10.7%) and lower percentages of high
    ORoB (27.6% vs. 52.7%). The double- and triple-blind studies had higher percentages of low
    ORoB (23.6% and 23.3%, respectively) while the non-blinded studies had the lowest percentage
    of low ORoB (1.0%) and highest percentage of high ORoB (80.4%). The studies with a cross-

    and parallel studies (11.2%). The quasi-experimental mainly had a high ORoB (98.4%).
    The high-ORoB studies had the highest mean sample size (n=414.3), followed by the unclear
    (n=213.6) and low (n=190.0) ORoBs.
    Discussion
    Ranked as 23rd among the 37 subjects in terms of volume, the “dentistry and oral health” subject
    comprises 2.4% of all Cochrane reviews. There is thus still a clear paucity of dental evidence in
    both interventional and diagnostic aspects compared to other medical disciplines(14). Aside from
    the quantity, the quality of the research is paramount and needs to be continuously enhanced as
    well. The dearth of evidence in dentistry and oral health subjects intensifies the need for high-
    quality studies on which clinicians can rely. To evaluate the quality of dental clinical trials, the
    RoB and other characteristics of the studies included in the Cochrane oral health systematic
    reviews were evaluated.
    Approximately half of the clinical trials (47.3%) showed a high ORoB compared to 11.1% with a
    low ORoB. This finding was in line with the results reported by Yordanov et al., which revealed
    43% of high ORoBs in medical clinical trials (15). Earlier assessments of RoB in dental clinical
    trials showed a significant decrease in studies judged as having inadequate methodological
    standards using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (16). Meanwhile, no specific associations were
    identified to guide dental practitioners for optimizing their future trials. The present findings are
    highly suggestive of using control groups in oral health-related interventional studies as it could
    noticeably decrease the ORoB. Furthermore, double- and triple-blind oral health-related

    interventional studies showed lower ORoBs compared to unblinded studies. Quasi-experimental
    studies showed higher ORoBs compared to cross-over, cluster RCT, and parallel designs. These
    findings can ultimately assist clinical researchers to direct their studies in more organized
    settings and designs and consider minimizing probable RoBs in their relevant projects.
    Even though dentists are able to conduct high-quality studies with low risks of performance bias
    (95.9% of the double- and triple-blinded studies), apparently they have not been very eager to
    follow the blinding protocols of clinical interventional studies (cumulative percentage of double-
    and triple-blinded studies=38.5%). This finding might be an implicit sign of incomprehensive
    dental research teams and the exclusive dispositions of clinical research in dentistry. Changing
    the exclusivity trend in research teams is proved to mainly impact the quality of evidence (17,
    18).
    Despite knowing that using control groups decreases the ORoB, only 32% of the clinical trials
    reported an arm as a control group. Also, among the various RoB domains, performance bias
    (blinding of the participants and personnel) showed the highest rate of high risk (31.4% of the
    studies). Consequently, setting correct methodological strategies and outlining the reporting
    protocol before conducting the study are imperative as well (15). These goals can be ensured by
    seeking the professional help of clinical methodologists and consulting with statisticians when
    planning studies and outlining their stages (17). Providing better platforms for these
    communications and constantly promoting their feasibility features are critical (19). Another
    long-term solution for decreasing the RoBs is to enhance the knowledge of dental students and
    dental practitioners about research methods (14, 20, 21). Teaching research methods should be
    pursued in parallel with the provision of more feasible and convenient ways for dental clinicians
    to contact professional methodologists, and a recommended step is to consult a statistician in

    taken. The patients are the ultimate stakeholders of these evidence-based decision-makings by
    dental practitioners, since they can be provided with the most reliable and up-to-date therapeutic
    options (22-24).
    This study takes into account the fact that the blinding of the care providers is unachievable in
    some clinical trials in dentistry (e.g. surgical cases). Nonetheless, there are still various aspects of
    dental clinical trials that could potentially be improved by simple feasible actions, such as the
    accurate reporting of sequence generation and allocation strategies or using the most relevant yet
    feasible study designs.
    Conclusion
    Nearly half of the dentistry and oral health-related clinical trials (47.3%) showed high ORoBs.
    Consequently, the quality of this dental evidence needs further enhancement and is inadequate in
    a noticeable part. If applicable, using methodological quality standards (e.g. blinding of the
    participants, using control groups, etc.) and using pre-determined study protocols (before
    conducting the research) and refining study designs to the most randomized settings possible can
    decrease the ORoB. Providing more feasible communication platforms for use among clinical
    researchers and statisticians and enhancing research methodology knowledge among clinicians
    can ultimately pave the way for conducting more high-standard studies in dentistry.
