  Abstract
  Background
  REACT-1 is quantifying prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among random samples of the
  population in England based on PCR testing of self-administered nose and throat swabs.
  Here we report results from the fifth round of observations for swabs collected from the 18th
  September to 5th October 2020. This report updates and should be read alongside our round
  5 interim report.
  Methods
  Representative samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England with sample size
  ranging from 120,000 to 175,000 people at each round. Prevalence of PCR-confirmed
  SARS-CoV-2 infection, estimation of reproduction number (R) and time trends between and
  within rounds using exponential growth or decay models.
  Results
  175,000 volunteers tested across England between 18th September and 5th October.
  Findings show a national prevalence of 0.60% (95% confidence interval 0.55%, 0.71%) and
  doubling of the virus every 29 (17, 84) days in England corresponding to an estimated
  national R of 1.16 (1.05, 1.27). These results correspond to 1 in 170 people currently
  swab-positive for the virus and approximately 45,000 new infections each day. At regional
  level, the highest prevalence is in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and the North
  East with strongest regional growth in North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and West
  Midlands.
  Conclusion
  Rapid growth has led to high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England, with highest rates
  in the North of England. Prevalence has increased in all age groups, including those at
  highest risk. Improved compliance with existing policy and, as necessary, additional
  interventions are required to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and limit
  the numbers of hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19.

  Introduction
  The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in England continues to cause increased
  hospitalizations, ICU bed admissions and deaths ​[1]​. The REal-time Assessment of
  Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study has been quantifying the community
  prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus over repeated rounds of data collection among separate
  samples of 120,000 to 175,000 people since May 2020 ​[2,3]​. We previously reported a rapid
  increase in infections in England between round 4 (mid August to early September 2020) ​[4]
  and interim results for round 5 (18th to 26th September 2020) ​[5]​. Here, we report results for
  the full period of data collection in round 5, to 5th October 2020.
  Methods
  Methods of REACT-1 have been described previously ​[2,3]​. Briefly, data collection is based
  on repeated random samples of the population at ages five years and over. Sampling uses
  the National Health Service (NHS) list of patients registered with a general practitioner,
  stratified by the 315 lower-tier local authorities in England. Participants provide a
  self-administered nose and throat swab (parent / guardian administered for children ages five
  to 12 years) and complete an online or telephone questionnaire. Swabs are sent on a cold
  chain to the laboratory for PCR testing. We estimated prevalence by dividing numbers of
  swab-positive results by numbers tested, and at national level reweighted prevalence
  estimates to be representative of the population of England. We analysed time trends
  between and within rounds using exponential growth or decay models, assuming numbers of
  positive swabs arose from a binomial distribution. We estimated the reproduction number R
  and doubling times, assuming the generation time followed a gamma distribution (mean 6.29
  days, standard deviation of 4.2) ​[6]​; R was estimated both between rounds and separately
  within each round of data collection. We used multivariable logistic regression to obtain
  adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations of swab positivity with
  covariates.
  Research ethics approval was obtained from the South Central-Berkshire B Research Ethics
  Committee (IRAS ID: 283787).
  Results
  These results for round 5 update those presented in our interim analysis but with increased
  precision reflecting the larger sample size ​[5]​.​ ​From 174,949 swab results we found 824
  positive samples for a weighted national average prevalence of 0.60% (95% confidence
  interval 0.55%, 0.71%) (Table 1, Figure 1).
                                                                                                                               3

  Overall, using data only from round 5, at the national level, we observe a growing epidemic
  with a doubling time of 29 (17, 84) days and a corresponding R number of 1.16 (1.05,1.27)
  (Table 2, Figure 2). This represents a modest deceleration from the doubling time of 13
  (11,14) days estimated using data from both rounds 4 and 5, which corresponds to an R
  value of 1.39 (1.34, 1.43).
  We found marked heterogeneity in prevalence in round 5 at regional level (Table 3, Figure 3).
  Unweighted prevalence was highest in: North West, 1.02% (0.89%, 1.17%); North East,
  0.91% (0.71%, 1.17%) and Yorkshire and The Humber 0.63% (0.51%, 0.80%). Unweighted
  prevalence was lowest in the South East at 0.26% (0.22%, 0.32%). London had an
  intermediate prevalence of 0.45% (0.36%, 0.56%).
  Using data only from round 5, we also found marked heterogeneity in growth patterns and R
  values at regional level (Table 4, Figure 4). We found greater than 95% probability that
  regional epidemics were growing in: North West, R = 1.27 (1.04, 1.53); Yorkshire and the
  Humber, R = 1.37 (1.00, 1.80); and West Midlands, R = 1.33 (0.97, 1.78). For London we
  estimated an R value of 0.97 (0.68, 1.31).
  The large number of positive swabs in this round permit an informative map of observed
  prevalence by lower tier local authority (LTLA, Figure 5). As expected from regional
  prevalence, the highest prevalence local authorities were mainly in the North and Midlands.
  The supporting data for this map are available by LTLA in the ​supporting data​.
  Since the previous round, unweighted prevalence increased in all age groups (Table 3,
  Figure 6). The highest prevalence was amongst the 18- to 24-year olds at 1.21% (0.98%,
  1.50%). For those ages 65 and over it increased 8-fold between the previous and present
  round from 0.04% (0.03%, 0.07%) to 0.33% (0.28%, 0.38%).
  Unweighted prevalence was highest in participants of Asian and Black ethnicity at 0.90%
  (0.71%, 1.13%) and 0.73% (0.45%, 1.18%) respectively (Table 3); this compares with 0.45%
  (0.42%, 0.48%) in white participants. Unweighted prevalence was highest in those living in
  large households. For those living in households of size 6 or 7+ prevalence was 0.81%
  (0.57%, 1.14%) and 1.06% (0.67%, 1.67%) respectively (Table 3); this compares with 0.35%
  (0.29%, 0.43%) in single occupancy households. Unweighted prevalence was highest in
  participants who lived in the most deprived areas at 0.77% (0.65%, 0.91%) (Table 3)
  We used logistic regression to estimate jointly-adjusted odds ratios for: age, region, ethnicity,
  work type, household size and quintile of deprivation (Table 5, Figure 7). The effect of
  deprivation was substantially reduced in the jointly adjusted model.
                                                                                                                               4

  In sensitivity analyses, our point estimate of R of 1.04 (0.89, 1.21) for round 5 using data for
  non-symptomatic individuals was lower than the all-participant R value, although with wide
  confidence intervals. Other sensitivity analyses, based on more stringent criteria for positivity
  gave estimates of R consistent with the main findings.
  Discussion
  In this fifth round of data collection from the REACT-1 study of SARS-CoV-2 virus prevalence
  in England, we report high and increasing prevalence of the virus especially in the North of
  England. At national level, around 1 in 170 people tested positive for the virus. Prevalence
  was highest among young adults (ages 18-24 years), but since the previous round in August
  / early September, it has increased markedly at all ages, including those at highest risk (ages
  65 years and over). We found geographical heterogeneity of risk across England with
  pockets of high prevalence at LTLA level, indicating the localised as well as national nature
  of the pandemic.
  Compared with our interim report on round 5 ​[5]​ we observed an increase in prevalence of
  infection in the latter part of round 5 and a firming-up of the reproduction number so that it is
  now reliably above one. We estimate that 450,000 (410,000, 530,000) are infected with
  SARS-CoV-2 in England on any one day (assuming a 75% sensitivity that a nose and throat
  swab picks up virus ​[7,8]​), which translates into 45,000 new infections per day assuming
  virus remains detectable for 10 days on average. At least half of those with detectable virus
  will not display symptoms on the day of testing or previous week ​[5]​.
  Our study has limitations. While we corrected for differences in population characteristics
  introduced by our sampling strategy and differential response rates, it is possible that our
  study is not fully representative of the population of England. At the time of sampling for
  round 5, difficulties were being experienced by symptomatic individuals in obtaining a test
  through the routine testing system in England. This suggests that a greater proportion of
  such individuals may have accessed testing through REACT-1 in round 5 than in previous
  rounds. Although the proportion of non-symptomatic people who tested positive was lower in
  the current round than previously ​[3]​, it was still 50%, and this did not vary between the first
  [5]​ and second halves of round 5 of REACT-1.
  Since the rapid increase in infection that we observed at the end of August and beginning of
  September, a number of measures have been put into place to attempt to curb the epidemic.
  These include the ‘rule of six’ limiting the number of contacts at a social event to no more
  than six people, closure of hospitality venues by 10 pm, and a series of local lockdown
                                                                                                                               5

  measures in areas of high apparent prevalence ​[9]​. While the rapid rate of rise observed in
  the previous round has slowed, the national epidemic is still growing.
  In combination with the high prevalence, and evidence of faster growth in some regions, the
  country is now at a critical point in the second wave. Continued vigilance and adherence to
  the public health message of social distancing, hand washing, face covers are required,
  along with testing of symptomatic individuals and, if positive, isolation and rapid tracing of
  contacts. However, further fixed-duration measures should be considered to reduce the
  infection rate and limit the numbers of hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19.
