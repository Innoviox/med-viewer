BACKGROUND: Recurrent skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) caused by Community-
Associated Methicillin-Resistant (CA-MRSA) or Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (CA-
MSSA) present treatment challenges.
OBJECTIVES: Can an evidence-based intervention (CDC Guidelines, topical decolonization,
surface decontamination) reduce SSTI recurrence, mitigate household contamination and
transmission, and improve patient-reported outcomes?
DESIGN: Randomized trial
SETTING: Community settings
PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n=186) with confirmed MRSA(+)/MSSA(+) SSTIs and household
members.
INTERVENTION Community Health Workers/Promotoras conducted home visits and provided
participants with instructions, a five-day supply of mupirocin for nasal application, chlorhexidine for
body cleansing, and disinfecting wipes for household cleaning (EXP) versus Usual Care (UC).
MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was six-month SSTI recurrence recorded in electronic health
records (EHR). Home visits (months 0/3) and telephone assessments (months 0/1/6) collected self-
report data. Surveillance culture swabs (nares, axilla, groin) were obtained from index patients and
participating household members. Secondary outcomes included household surface contamination,
household member colonization and transmission, quality of life and satisfaction with care.
RESULTS: Among patients with SSTIs (n=421), 44.2% were MRSA(+)/MSSA(+); an intent-to-
treat analyses (n=186) demonstrated no significant differences in SSTI recurrence (OR: 1.4, 95% CI:
0.51-3.5). Among the enrolled cohort (n=119), there were no significant SSTI recurrence effects
(OR=1.14, 95% CI=0.35-3.6). EXP participants showed reduced but non-significant colonization
rates. There were no differential reductions in household member transmission or in reductions in
                                                                                                               3

proportions of households with >1 contaminated surface. Mupirocin resistance did not increase. No
significant improvements for patient-reported outcomes were seen.
LIMITATIONS: A lower-than-predicted six-month recurrence rate may have limited the ability to
detect effects.
CONCLUSION: This intervention did not reduce clinician-reported MRSA/MSSA SSTI recurrence.
No differences were observed for household members decolonization or household surfaces
decontamination.
                                                                                                           4

                                                                  Do not cite or reproduce without permission
        Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causes multi-drug resistant infections
that pose serious clinical and public health challenges. Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) (1, 2)
caused by MRSA carry significant morbidity and mortality, and impact patients, families, caregivers,
and health-care institutions (3, 4). While studies comparing protocols for reducing healthcare-
associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) infections (5) exist, those adapted for community-associated MRSA
(CA-MRSA) (6) SSTIs have provided mixed results (7-12). CA-MRSA SSTIs commonly affect
healthy, young individuals without exposure to healthcare risk factors or contacts (13).
        Most CA-MRSA SSTIs are treated successfully in ambulatory care. However, treatment
failure may result in risk of exposure and transmission to household and community members (10,
14-18). Even when primary treatment is successful, recurrent infections are common, ranging from
16% (14, 19, 20) to 43% (9, 21). Little research has examined the feasibility and effectiveness of
implementing evidence-based interventions in primary care settings (22). This trial tested two
community-based interventions: (1) Usual Care (UC): CDC-Guidelines directed care (incision and
drainage (I&D) and antibiogram-selected oral antibiotics (versus (2) Experimental (EXP): UC
combined with universal household decolonization and environmental decontamination interventions
based on the REDUCE MRSA Trial (5, 23, 24), provided in the home by Community Health Workers
(CHW)/Promotoras. We evaluated the comparative effectiveness on SSTI recurrence rates (primary
outcome) and household contamination, household member colonization and transmission, and
patient-centered measures (pain, depression, quality of life, and care satisfaction) (secondary
outcomes) using a two-arm 1:1 randomized controlled trial (RCT). We hypothesized that participants
assigned to EXP would experience fewer SSTI recurrences compared to UC.
                                                                                                              5

                                                                   Do not cite or reproduce without permission
METHODS
        This RCT included practicing clinicians, patients, clinical and laboratory researchers, NY-
based Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and community hospital Emergency Departments
(EDs). The stakeholder research collaborative expands an earlier partnership, the Community-
Acquired MRSA Project (CAMP1) which developed research to address CA-MRSA (25-29). The
study was approved by Institutional Review Boards at Clinical Directors Network and Rockefeller
University.
Study Setting
        Three NYC FQHCs and three EDs recruited participants presenting with an SSTI with
culture-positive MRSA or MSSA.
Participants
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Participants included were: (1) between 7-70 years, (2) fluent in
English or Spanish, (3) planning to receive follow-up care at the FQHC or ED, (4) presenting with
SSTI signs/symptoms, (5) had laboratory-confirmed baseline wound culture positive for MRSA or
MSSA (also a significant cause of SSTIs; (6) willing/able to provide informed consent, and (7) willing
to participate in two home visits. Participants were excluded if they were: (1) unwilling to provide
informed consent, (2) acutely ill or visibly distressed (for example, crying, wheezing, bleeding,
screaming or shaken), and/or (3) unable to participate in home visits or in a discussion about the
study.
Study Protocol
Screening: Patients seeking care for an SSTI were identified via the site’s electronic health record
(EHR) or clinical dashboard. CHWs flagged patients for treating clinicians to determine eligibility.
                                                                                                               6

                                                                   Do not cite or reproduce without permission
Procedures: Recruitment, informed consent, and baseline clinical assessments were conducted by
trained CHW/Promotoras with clinicians and FQHC/ED staff. Following written informed consent,
clinicians conducted baseline clinical assessments and collected wound cultures. Wound and
surveillance (nasal, axilla, and groin) cultures were sent to one commercial clinical laboratory
(BioReference) for culture, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and speciation. Additional molecular
epidemiologic testing was carried out by Rockefeller’s Laboratory of Microbiology and Infectious
Diseases (27) Mupirocin susceptibility was tested using E-test strips (bioMérieux, Durham, NC)
following CLSI recommendations (30).
        All participants received clinician-directed standard-of-care treatment, including I&D and/or
oral antibiotics. If I&D was performed, a sample of purulent drainage material was obtained; if I&D
was not indicated, the clinicians took a swab of the wound or, if the wound was weeping or draining,
obtained purulent material. During the same visit, on-site CHW/Promotoras scheduled the home visit.
If a CHW/Promotora or other research staff member was not present, per “warm hand off” procedures
(31), clinical staff informed participants that a CHW/Promotora would telephone them.
        When culture lab results became available (2-3 days later), medical staff disclosed
MRSA/MSSA status. CHW/Promotoras then called each participant to inform them of eligibility. For
those with MRSA+ or MSSA+ SSTIs, CHW/Promotoras confirmed the baseline telephone interview
appointment and baseline home visit.
Assessments
Baseline Assessments: Supplement Figures 1a and 1b detail the full assessment protocol. A Baseline
Telephone Questionnaire including demographics, medical history, comorbidity, social, occupational
and environmental exposures, household composition and patient-centered outcomes (Supplement
Table 1) was administered in English or Spanish.
                                                                                                               7

                                                                   Do not cite or reproduce without permission
         The Baseline Home Visit Assessment (T1) captured: (1) consenting household members’
demographics, comorbidities, SSTI history, and index patient and household member personal
hygiene, (2) household sharing behaviors, (3) collection and retrieval of self-sampled surveillance
cultures from the index patient and consenting household member, (4) census of the numbers of
rooms, household inhabitants and regular visitors, (5) 13 samples obtained from high touch/high
traffic household environmental surfaces (see figure 3a) using ESwabs™ (Copan Diagnostics, Inc.,
Murrieta, CA).
         CHWs/Promotoras oversaw participants’ and household members’ self-sampling of nares,
inguinal folds, and axillae. Prior to randomization, participants received the educational pamphlet,
“Living with MRSA”, available in English and Spanish (32).
Follow Up Assessments: Home visits occurred at three-months (T3). Interim telephone assessments
at one-month (T2) and six-month follow-up (T4) were conducted (Supplement Figure 1a). Reviews
of EHRs were conducted at T4 to record SSTI recurrence (i.e., one or more discrete clinical SSTI(s)
at the same or new site in addition to the baseline infection during the six months following trial
enrollment). Patient-reported SSTI recurrence was also recorded. While we had planned to combine
SSTI recurrence data from EHR and self-reports, participants’ self-reports had poor concordance with
EHR-based clinician reports, so we limited the main analysis to clinician-documented SSTI
recurrence.
Randomization: After baseline questionnaires and household sampling data were collected, and
while still at the home, CHWs/Promotoras opened a sealed opaque envelope containing the computer-
generated randomization (1:1), overseen by the offsite, blinded study statistician (JCdR). Participants
were not stratified during randomization based on recruitment site or pathogen (MRSA or MSSA). If
                                                                                                               8

                                                                   Do not cite or reproduce without permission
randomized to UC, the CHW/Promotoras explained the timeline for remaining assessments and
concluded the visit. No further intervention materials were provided to UC.
Interventions: Modeled on the REDUCE MRSA trial (5), EXP received CDC and Infectious Disease
Society of America guidelines-directed usual care (23, 33) combined with universal household
decolonization and environmental decontamination educational interventions (5) and materials from
CHWs/Promotoras. They received detailed verbal, written, and demonstrated instructions of the five-
day protocol of twice-daily application of mupirocin ointment to the anterior nares with a clean cotton
applicator (34), once-daily Hibiclens® (chlorhexidine gluconate solution 4% w/v) whole body wash
(9, 12, 23, 35-37), and household decontamination instruction including: (1) proper handwashing
technique, (2) laundering bed linens and pillows in warm water every other day, and (3) disinfection
of “high touch” environmental surfaces with disposable disinfecting wipes (33, 38).
Retention and Withdrawal: Participants who withdrew were asked to provide reason(s) for
withdrawal (see CONSORT Diagram, Figure 1. We attempted to reach all participants until the trial
completion date.
Sample Size Calculations and Power
        Sample size estimation was based on SSTI recurrence rate from CAMP1, where 33.3%
experienced an recurrence during the six months following their index SSTI (28); previous studies of
HA-MRSA reported reductions between 30% and 55% (39-41) To achieve 80% power at 5%
significance level in a two-sided Chi Square/Fisher’s Exact test for recurrence at 6-month follow-up,
estimated sample size requirement was 120 participants (60 per group).
Analytical and Statistical Approaches
        Chi-square tests were applied for comparison of proportions and t-tests were used for
continuous quantitative variables. All primary main effects outcomes analyses (n=186) were
                                                                                                               9

                                                                     Do not cite or reproduce without permission
evaluated according to “Intent-to-Treat” (ITT). Subsequent planned analyses included patients who
completed the baseline home visit (n=119, “analysis cohort”) and pre-specified subgroups. Logistic
regression and generalized linear mixed effect models were used for hypothesis testing. All analyses
were conducted with SAS (Version 9.3) or R (Version 3.0).
Missing Data/Sensitivity Analyses
        Although we observed a small proportion of missing data, data were assumed to be “missing
not at random” (MNAR) so we used a sensitivity approach rather than multiple imputation. No
meaningful or statistically significant differences were revealed between the original versus
sensitivity analysis results.
Role of Funding Source
        The trial was funded by Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). PCORI
scientific staff played no role in study design and conduct, and were actively involved in the
preparation of the final report.
RESULTS
Baseline Comparisons: Experimental versus Usual Care
        A total of 602 patients were assessed for eligibility (Figure 1; 115 from FQHCs and 487 from
EDs), of whom 421 (86.4%) provided informed consent, and 186 (44.2%) tested positive for MRSA
or MSSA, and were invited to complete the baseline home visit (i.e., “intent-to-treat cohort”). Of 186
eligible consented participants, 120 (65%), completed baseline home visits.
        Patients who did (n=120) and did not (n=66) complete the baseline home visit were similar
(Supplement Table 2), with equal proportions undergoing I&D (60.7%). Both groups exhibited
similar dermatologic symptoms, with no differences in lesion location, size, type, purulence, or
signs/symptoms of SSTIs (Supplement Table S2). We also compared those who completed the
                                                                                                                 10

                                                                  Do not cite or reproduce without permission
allocated intervention and had 6-month follow-up data (n=92) to those who received the allocated
intervention but did not complete the 6-month follow-up survey (n=28, Supplement Table S3). Rates
of I&D, MRSA/MSSA, and recruitment source (FQHC vs ED) were similar.
        No statistically significant differences were detected between EXP and UC in baseline
demographics, comorbidity, baseline occupational or environmental or social exposures (Tables 1a-
1c) or in the proportion of household members who participated in the study: 64.1% of household
members provided surveillance cultures (EXP=67.5%, UC=60.2%, p=0.34; see Figure 4). About half
(52.5%) spoke English as their primary language and 36.4% spoke Spanish as their primary language.
Microbiological and dermatologic characteristics, and health care utilization were similar,
(Supplement Table S4) but MRSA+ wounds were more common among patients randomized to EXP
(66.1%) as compared to UC (32.1%, p=0.0004).
SSTI Recurrence
        We used logistic regression analyses to detect treatment group differences on EHR-
documented SSTI recurrence at six-month follow-up (Table 2). We conducted initial main effects
analysis using all randomized subjects (n=186, “intent-to-treat cohort”). Based on the sensitivity
analysis, we conducted all further analyses using completed cases (n=119, “analysis cohort”). The
ITT analysis demonstrated no significant differences in infection recurrence between EXP (11.1%)
and UC (10.7%; OR=1.4, 95% CI=0.51-3.5). Likewise, when examining the analysis cohort, there
were no statistically significant differences between EXP and UC on EHR-documented SSTI
recurrence: 11.1% of EXP vs 10.7% of UC had a documented SSTI recurrence (OR=1.14, 95%
CI=0.35, 3.6; Table 2).
        Differences in SSTI recurrence based on self-report (Table 2) showed a trend in the opposite
direction: EXP reported a greater recurrence rate at 6 months (22.2%) than UC (7.5%, OR = 3.5 95%
                                                                                                              11

                                                                   Do not cite or reproduce without permission
CI=0.89, 13.8). Given the differences between EHR-documented and self-reported recurrence we
examined concordance by treatment group and by baseline wound characterization. 15.4% of
participants with a self-reported SSTI recurrence also had a documented clinical SSTI recurrence.
Retrospective self-report of pre-study infections found 30.5% of participants reported >1 prior SSTI,
whereas 90.7% of participants had documented pre-study SSTIs in their EHRs, indicating poor
concordance between EHR and self-report.
        The ITT analysis resulted in similar trends when restricted to the enrolled analysis cohort. We
also added one additional unplanned analysis comparing the EHR-measured 6 month SSTI outcome
with an “observation only control group” (n=66) comprised of eligible individuals with a confirmed
MRSA+/MSSA+ wound culture who had initially consented to participate, but did not complete the
baseline home visit, so their randomization assignment was never disclosed to these participants or
study staff (Supplement Table 2). These participants did not receive any intervention or assessment
beyond what was extracted from the EHR, and had no further interactions with research staff,
although they continued to receive care where they were recruited. The observed prospective SSTI
recurrence rate at 6 month EHR review for the “observation only control group” (10.5%) was similar
to those of the EXP (11.1%) and UC (10.7%) groups.
Index Patient Colonization
        Index patient colonization (nares, axilla, and groin) was measured at baseline and three
months. Similar baseline colonization rates were observed: nares (EXP = 41.3% vs UC = 32.1%),
axilla (EXP = 34.9% vs UC = 32.1%), groin (EXP = 49.2% vs UC = 44.6%; Figure 2a). S. aureus
was recovered at baseline from at least one site (Figure 2b) in most patients (EXP = 74.6 % vs UC =
66.1%). While most patients were colonized at one site (EXP = 34.9 % vs UC = 35.7%), some were
colonized at two (EXP = 28.6% vs UC = 17.9%) or three sites (EXP = 11.1% vs UC = 12.5%)
                                                                                                               12

                                                                  Do not cite or reproduce without permission
        Three months post-intervention, there was an overall reduction in colonization, with S. aureus
less frequently recovered from all body sites. Implementation of the decolonization intervention
demonstrated that colonization rates in EXP were non-signifiicantly reduced at three months for nares
(OR=0.41, 95% CI=0.16-1.04), axilla (OR=0.77, 95% CI=0.31-1.91) and groin (OR=0.53, 95%
CI=0.24,1.20), whereas there were little decreases in UC (Figure 2a). Overall, the increase in
participants with no organisms detected at three months was greater in EXP (36.5% point increase)
as compared to UC (17.2% point increase; Figure 2b). We did not observe any increase in mupirocin
resistance between baseline (3%) and three months (0%; data not shown).
Patient-Centered Outcomes
        No intervention-related behavioral changes were observed, including infection prevention
knowledge and hygiene, prevention self-efficacy, decision-making autonomy, mupirocin and
chlorhexidine adherence, QoL or patient satisfaction (Supplement Tables S1 and S5).
Household Surfaces Contamination
        At baseline, the most frequently contaminated surfaces included: toilet seat (EXP = 52.4% vs
UC = 53.6%), bedroom floor (EXP = 49.2 % vs UC = 60.7%), and kitchen floor (EXP = 60.3% vs
UC = 58.9%; Figure 3a), and most households had >1 contaminated surfaces (EXP = 96.8% vs UC
= 96.4%). Both groups showed similar reductions in environmental contamination (Figure 3b). There
were no differences in reductions in proportions of households with >1 contaminated surfaces, EXP
(96.8% to 60.3%) vs UC (96.4% to 66.1%). Linear regression examining the average difference in
numbers of contaminated surfaces (0-13) showed that there were 0.31 fewer contaminated surfaces
at follow-up in EXP versus UC, after adjusting for baseline number of contaminated surfaces (p=0.08;
data not shown). Multivariate models with treatment allocation and number of household surfaces
did not reveal any associations among these environmental-level factors and SSTI recurrence.
                                                                                                              13

                                                                   Do not cite or reproduce without permission
Household Members Colonization and Reported Infection
        Consenting household members were screened for colonization (nares, axilla, groin) at
baseline and three months. Among household members, similar reductions in proportions of
colonized sites were seen for nares (EXP 27.0% to 17.5% vs UC 23.2% to 17.9%), axilla (EXP 17.5%
to 9.5% vs UC 14.3% to 10.7%) and groin (EXP 28.6% to 19.1% vs UC 21.4% to 19.6%; Figure 4a).
There was a non-significant reduction in household member colonization for EXP (9.5% to 3.2%)
versus UC (8.9% to 5.4%). MSSA+ household members were similar at baseline and three-month
follow-up in both EXP and UC, with no observed reductions in percentages of household members
colonized by MSSA (Figure 4b).
Subgroup Considerations/Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects (HTE)
        We conducted pre-specified subgroup analyses using logistic regression with treatment
assignment and with each subgroup coded as dummy variables. Consistent with previous studies (28),
foreign-born participants were more likely to have MSSA+ than MRSA+ wound cultures. Other HTE
subgroup comparisons [wound culture type (MRSA vs MSSA), birthplace (USA vs non-USA),
household contamination levels (low vs high), household members colonization (present vs absent),
pets living in the household (present vs absent), recruitment site (ED vs FQHC), and baseline I&D
treatment (yes vs no)] revealed no statistically significant differences for EHR-documented SSTI
recurrence (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
        This study adapted and implemented an effective hospital ICU-based intervention (5) into the
community. We examined the comparative effectiveness of usual care: CDC/Guidelines-directed care
(23, 24) versus an experimental intervention: UC combined with universal decolonization and
environmental decontamination (5, 23, 24). Results suggest that this was a null trial. There were few
                                                                                                               14

                                                                       Do not cite or reproduce without permission
observed hypothesized intervention-related differences for clinical, microbiological and patient-
centered outcomes.
        The primary and secondary outcomes analyses indicated that EXP fared as well as UC.
Despite a significant baseline difference in MRSA-positive (more common in EXP) and MSSA-
positive (more common in UC) cultures which we had not anticipated and therefore did not stratify
during randomization, we saw no evidence that this baseline imbalance affected the analyses.
        Interestingly, the overall study rate of SSTI recurrence was substantially lower (10.8%) than
previous studies (42, 43), although a recent cohort study reported a comparable 3-month recurrence
rate (10.3%) (10). It is possible that high study rates of I&D plus oral antibiotics contributed to the
lower than expected SSTI recurrence rate. One recruitment site, a large public hospital ED,
predominated, which might explain a lower than expected recurrence (44) since treatments used there
have been demonstrated effective in preventing treatment failure and SSTI recurrence (10, 17, 45,
46); thus suggesting a statistical floor effect hindered detection of differences in recurrence. Similarly,
the low event rates of household and environmental outcomes reduced the study’s power to detect
significant treatment effects. Finally, EXP were more likely to have no detectable S. aureus
colonization at three months, but again the difference was not significant.
        The environmental persistence of S. aureus and as a colonizer despite active eradication
efforts is well-documented and multifactorial (9, 44, 47-49) and likely modulated by interactions
inside the household and surrounding community (10, 19, 50-53). Overall, the percent of households
with no environmental contamination increased substantially (from 3.2% to 39.7%). However, 60.3%
of households were still contaminated and enhanced antimicrobial measures were not more effective
(9) than standard patient education and UC. This reflects the inherent challenges of eradicating this
opportunistic pathogen in residential settings. While previous studies have demonstrated higher rates
                                                                                                                   15

                                                                      Do not cite or reproduce without permission
of colonization and contamination are associated with recurrence (21, 53, 54), there are conflicting
reports of whether reduction in bioburden translates into less recurrence (22, 55, 56). Previous
interventions to reduce S. aureus carriage and SSTI recurrence provide mixed results (7, 9, 11, 12,
22, 56-60). Interestingly, Golding, et al showed community education focusing on patient and
household hygiene decreased SSTI incidence (61). The universally distributed Living with MRSA
pamphlet (32) likely contributed to total study recurrence reduction, potentially obscuring the
intervention impact.
Study Limitations
        This study’s results likely reflect unmeasured and uncontrolled variables, including
application and effectiveness of bioburden reduction and microbial dynamics in an open system (44,
48, 49, 62). Additionally, there were significantly more MRSA+ wounds in EXP vs UC. This higher
MRSA bioburden may have made decolonization and decontamination more challenging (53),
thereby obfuscating any study treatment-related differences. Since EXP participants were aware of
the intervention methods, it is plausible that their sensitization led participants to focus on minor skin
symptoms that were ignored by UC, resulting in higher self reported SSTI recurrence.
        In order to minimize the burden of multiple home visits and increase study participation,
follow-up sampling took place at three months, rather than immediately following initial
decolonization and decontamination. Therefore, the immediate effectiveness of the experimental
protocol was not measured. It is possible that organisms detected after three-months were not
eradicated at baseline since S. aureus can exhibit long-term survival on surfaces (63, 64). However,
host recolonization and replenishment of the environment over time is also possible.
Future directions
                                                                                                                  16

                                                                     Do not cite or reproduce without permission
        Implementing common hospital cleaning protocols (5, 33, 65, 66) within a community setting
was a formidable challenge and warrants further investigation. Future studies should stratify on
infection wound culture type [MRSA(+) vs MSSA(+)] prior to randomization, to ensure balance in
treatment assignment, and may wish to power each subgroup sufficiently for SSTI recurrence, as well
as measure effects of active antimicrobial measures immediately following completion of the
regimen. While nasal decolonization routine herein is standard practice (24), it is possible that a
longer and/or more potent decolonization protocol is required to reduce MRSA recurrence (12, 43,
54, 67, 68). In fact, recent studies implementing a similar yet more intense decolonization intervention
decreased recurrent MRSA infection recurrence (12, 67). These data, combined with our data,
indicate that greater frequency and longer duration of decolonization may be required.
Conclusions
        This trial aimed to understand systems-, patient-, pathogen-, and environmental-level factors
associated with SSTI recurrence and household transmission. Home visits presented a major
challenge. Although the perceived (or actual) intrusiveness of home visits proved difficult to
overcome, the “warm hand-off” strategy facilitated a modest improvement in home visit completion
rates (69). The lower-than-expected six-month recurrence rate (10.9% here as compared to our
previous observational study of 33.3% (28)) may have limited the power to identify a treatment effect.
Multiple well-designed studies conducted in different settings have all converged on similar findings:
decolonization and decontamination can be accomplished in the household to varying degrees, but
extensive, long-term decontamination may be required to achieve a medically meaningful reduction
in disease recurrence. These findings suggest that other mechanisms may also contribute to the
disconnect between exposure and outcome, such as intrinsic host factors including immunologic
                                                                                                                 17

competence, as well as perturbations of host and environmental microbiomes. These factors warrant
further observational and experimental studies.

Figure 1. CONSORT Diagram
  * “Intent-to-treat” cohort (n=186)** “Analysis” cohort (n=119). An additional n=66 participants were eligible for participation
  based on having either MRSA+/MSSA+ wound culture and provided informed consent; however these participants did not
  complete the baseline home visit, and therefore never received the intervention. Since these participants had consented to be
  followed, their six-month chart review data were extracted and are provided as an additional “observation-only control group”
  (n=63 of these participants were analyzed, for a 95.5% response rate). Upon subsequent review, one patient was determined to
  have met criteria for HA-MRSA and considered ineligible and these data were removed from the analysis, leaving n=119
  (“analysis cohort”). Data collection spanned 11/01/2015 and 11/25/2017.

Notes:
1
  Prospective recurrence is defined as report of a new SSTI in the 6-month period following the initial (baseline)
infection for which the participant was recruited. EHR-based outcomes were assessed at 6-months post-baseline and
include the time period 12 months prior and 6 months after the baseline infection. At the baseline telephone assessment
(T0), and prospective recurrence was assessed at the 6-month telephone assessment (T4).
2
  The observed prospective recurrence rate at 6-month EHR review for the Observation Only Group (n=66, 10.5%)
was not different from either the Experimental (11.1%) or Usual Care (10.7%) or Total (10.7%).
3
  Total n differs by data source: EHR-based (n=119), Self-Report (n=92). All analyses are unadjusted for covariates.
