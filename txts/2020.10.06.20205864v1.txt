11 Abstract
12 Human infection with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, leads to a remarkably diverse
13 spectrum of outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. Recent reports suggest that both clinical and
14 genetic risk factors may contribute to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. To investigate genetic risk
15 factors, we collected over 500,000 COVID-19 survey responses between April and May 2020 with
16 accompanying genetic data from the AncestryDNA database. We conducted sex-stratified and meta-
17 analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for COVID-19 susceptibility (positive
18 nasopharyngeal swab test, ncases=2,407) and severity (hospitalization, ncases=250). The severity GWAS
19 replicated associations with severe COVID-19 near ABO and SLC6A20 (P<0.05). Furthermore, we
20 identified three novel loci with P<5x10-8. The strongest association was near IVNS1ABP, a gene
21 involved in influenza virus replication1, and was associated only in males. The other two novel loci
22 harbor genes with established roles in viral replication or immunity: SRRM1 and the immunoglobulin
23 lambda locus. We thus present new evidence that host genetic variation likely contributes to COVID-19
24 outcomes and demonstrate the value of large-scale, self-reported data as a mechanism to rapidly address
25 a health crisis.

26 Introduction
27 Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of
28 COVID-19, precipitated a pandemic with >21 million cases and >760,000 deaths worldwide as of
29 August 2020.2 Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United States are diverse; most infections
30 result in mild illness that can be managed at home, yet ~14% of cases are hospitalized and ~5% are
31 fatal.3 Epidemiological studies have identified clinical risk factors for severe COVID-19 that include
32 common health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, older age, and male sex.4,5 Reports of
33 higher susceptibility to6,7,8 and severity of9 SARS-CoV infections in men could suggest important
34 biological differences in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in men relative to women.10
35
36 In addition to clinical risk factors, emerging evidence suggests that host genetic variation may contribute
37 to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Ellinghaus et al. conducted a genome-wide association study
38 (GWAS) of COVID-19 cases with respiratory failure and identified two loci that achieved genome-wide
39 significance: one signal on chromosome (chr) 9 near the ABO gene, which determines blood type, and
40 one signal on chr 3 near a cluster of genes with known immune function including SLC6A20, CXCR6,
41 CCR1, CCR2, and CCR9.11 Additionally, a small whole-exome sequencing study identified TLR7, an
42 X-chromosome gene involved in interferon signal induction, in four male patients with severe
43 COVID-19.12 To validate rapidly emerging results from new studies such as the Ellinghaus study,
44 further investigation in independent datasets is needed. Furthermore, investigation in larger datasets with
45 increased statistical power may detect additional, novel host genetic variation relevant to COVID-19
46 susceptibility and severity.
47
48 To replicate and discover non-genetic6 and genetic associations with COVID-19 outcomes, we engaged
49 AncestryDNA members who have consented to research in the United States, with 18 million total
                                                                          2

50 individuals in the global network. On April 22, 2020, we released a 54-question COVID-19 survey
51 intended to assess exposure, risk factors, symptomatology, and demographic information that had been
52 previously identified as associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in the evolving pandemic.
53 In under two months, over 500,000 COVID-19 survey responses were collected with a 95% survey
54 completion rate.
55
56 From these self-reported outcomes, we constructed two phenotypes: one intended to assess
57 susceptibility, in which individuals who reported a positive COVID-19 test were compared to those who
58 reported a negative test (referred to throughout as “susceptibility”) and one intended to assess severity,
59 in which who were hospitalized with COVID-19 were compared to COVID-19 positive individuals who
60 were not hospitalized (referred to throughout as “hospitalization”). To identify novel genetic
61 determinants of these outcomes, we conducted a GWAS for each phenotype in a cohort of European-
62 descent individuals. Sex-stratified GWAS were performed to investigate potential biological sex-driven
63 differences in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the GWAS results were meta-analyzed
64 to maximize statistical power for variant discovery.

66 Results
67 COVID-19 survey results and cohort demographics
68 To validate the COVID-19 survey, we examined how representative our cohort is with respect to the
69 United States population both in terms of COVID-19 infection status and demographics. The COVID-19
70 survey presented to AncestryDNA customers who consented to research has between 39 and 54
71 questions, depending on reported COVID-19 test result (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary
72 Table 1). The first survey question assesses testing status, and in total, 3,733, or 13.4% of respondents
73 who were tested, reported a positive test result (Supplementary Table 2) – a proportion comparable to
                                                                          3

74 the national cumulative positivity rate of 12% during a similar collection period (March 1 - May 30,
75 2020).13 Of respondents that reported a positive COVID-19 test, 375 (11%) reported hospitalization,
76 comparable to a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report of a 14% hospitalization
77 rate (Supplementary Table 3).3
78
79 Extended demographic data presented in Supplementary Table 3 show that the proportion of
80 COVID-19 survey respondents with European ancestry is largely consistent with the U.S. population:
81 roughly 75% of respondents were classified as having European ancestry, comparable to 73% of the
82 U.S. general population that self-identify as “white” in the United States Census Bureau’s 2018
83 American Community Survey.14 In the COVID-19 survey, 65% of respondents were female, and the
84 United States Census Bureau’s 2018 American Community Survey reports a female population of
85 50.8%. This is consistent with previous literature reporting gender differences in willingness to
86 participate in survey completion.15 The median age of COVID-19 survey respondents was 56, notably
87 higher than the national median age14 of 38; however, a minimum age of 18 was required to participate
88 in the study.
89
90 The survey data were filtered to select a final GWAS cohort to analyze (filtering steps summarized in
91 Supplementary Figure 2). Table 1 presents the final GWAS cohort sample sizes for the susceptibility
92 and severity phenotypes. In total, 2,417 cases (862 male, 1,555 female) and 14,933 controls (4,472 male,
93 10,461 female) were used in the susceptibility GWAS and 250 cases (105 male, 145 female) and 1,967
94 controls (679 male, 1,288 female) were used in the hospitalization GWAS.

 97 Ellinghaus et al. (2020) performed a GWAS consisting of 1,980 Spanish and Italian COVID-19 cases
 98 with respiratory failure and 1,805 controls, most of whom had not been tested for COVID-19. This study
 99 identified two loci that achieved genome-wide significance: one signal on chr 3 represented by
100 rs11385942 near the SLC6A20 gene and one signal on chr 9 represented by rs657152 near the ABO
101 gene.11
102
103 We assessed replication of the lead SNPs at the two loci identified by Ellinghaus et al.11 within our
104 hospitalization GWAS. Although the phenotypes are not the same, both respiratory failure and
105 hospitalization assess aspects of COVID-19 infection severity. As summarized in Table 2, we observed
106 nominal replication of the lead SNPs at these two loci in our hospitalization analysis at both the ABO
107 locus (P=0.022) and the SLC6A20 locus (P=0.020). For both loci, consistent risk alleles and directions
108 of effect were observed, but with generally smaller odds ratios (ORs) than those reported by Ellinghaus
109 and colleagues. We did not observe significant associations at either locus in the susceptibility analysis
110 (Supplementary Table 4).
111
112 Novel associations with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity
113 We conducted a sex-stratified GWAS adjusted for orthogonal age, orthogonal age2, array version, and
114 PC1-12 (Supplementary Table 5), to investigate possible differences in genetic associations with
115 COVID-19 outcomes in males and females and meta-analyzed the resulting summary statistics to
116 maximize statistical power. For the susceptibility phenotype, the male GWAS, female GWAS, and
117 meta-analysis had genomic inflation factors of 1.00, 1.01, and 1.00, respectively (Supplementary
118 Figure 3). The hospitalization GWAS had genomic inflation factors of 1.04, 1.01, and 0.99 for males,
119 females, and the meta-analysis, respectively (Supplementary Figure 4). In total, three novel loci
                                                                           5

120 surpassed the genome-wide significance threshold of 5x10-8 in at least one study: two separate loci on
121 chr 1 and one locus on chr 22 (Table 3 and Figure 1, Supplementary Figures 5 and 6).
122
123 In the susceptibility analysis, the most significant association was represented by lead SNP rs6668622,
124 with the association present in males only (P=3.28x10-9; OR=0.69) (Figure 1c-d) and absent in females
125 (P=0.37; OR=0.96) (Figure 1e-f). In the sex-combined meta-analysis, the rs6668622 association did not
126 reach genome-wide significance (P=3.83x10-5; OR=0.87). Consistent with the differential association
127 observed in men and women, there is significant heterogeneity of effect (I2) for rs6668622 between the
128 male and the female studies (I2=94; P=1.6x10-5; Supplementary Table 6). This signal is intergenic and
129 the nearest protein-coding genes to rs6668622 are IVNS1ABP (~150Kb) and SWT1 (~288Kb)
130 (Supplementary Figure 7).
131
132 We identified an additional locus associated with susceptibility on chr 22, represented by lead SNP
133 rs73166864. This locus achieved genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis (P=1.56x10-8;
134 OR=1.70); the effect sizes were not significantly different (I2=1.6; P=0.20; Supplementary Table 6) in
135 the male (P=1.19x10-5; OR=1.97) and female (P=2.21x10-4; OR=1.55) analyses. The variant
136 rs73166864 is intergenic and is within 500kb of the immunoglobulin lambda locus16, which encodes
137 proteins used to construct the light chains of antibodies. The nearest protein-coding genes to rs73166864
138 are IGLL5, GNAZ, RSPH14, RAB36 and BCR (Supplementary Figure 8).
139
140 In the hospitalization meta-analysis, a locus on chr 1 surpassed genome-wide significance. The lead
141 SNP, rs111972040, is uncommon with a MAF of approximately 1%, but with a large estimated effect
142 size in the hospitalization meta-analysis (P=8.38x10-9; OR=8.29). Although rs111972040 did not
143 achieve genome-wide significance in either sex-stratified GWAS, the estimated ORs in the male
                                                                           6

144 (P=3.46x10-3; OR=6.50) and female (P=8.01x10-7; OR=9.37) studies were large and there was no
145 significant heterogeneity of effect between males and females (I2=0; P=0.63; Supplementary Table 6).
146 The variant rs111972040 is a non-coding transcript variant in the gene SRRM1, and NCMAP, CLIC4,
147 RCAN3, NIPAL3, and RUNX3 are all within 500kb (Supplementary Figure 9).
148
149 To assess whether clinical risk factors other than age and sex had an effect on these associated loci, we
150 additionally adjusted for other associated risk factors including body mass index (BMI) and having one
151 or more pre-existing health conditions (asthma, bone marrow transplant, cancer, cardiovascular disease,
152 kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, hypertension, organ
153 transplant, autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency, or lung conditions). For all three novel lead SNPs,
154 the estimated effect sizes remained relatively consistent, though the P-value dropped below
155 genome-wide significance in the hospitalization analysis, likely in part due to the small sample size and
156 the additional decrease in sample size for these extended analyses (Supplementary Table 7). Both loci
157 associated with susceptibility remained genome-wide significant even after adjusting for these additional
158 clinical risk factors.
159
160 Heritability of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity
161 We estimated narrow-sense heritability (h2) – defined as the proportion of phenotypic variation due to
162 additive genetic factors17 – using the linear mixed model approach (GCTA-GREML)18 and autosomal
163 genome-wide imputed variants. The underlying assumption of this linear mixed model approach is that
164 the included common variants all contribute equally small effects to heritability.19
165
166 To our knowledge, these are the first estimates of heritability for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity
167 (hospitalization) based on empirical genetic similarity, though one twin-based study estimated
                                                                           7

168 heritability of COVID-19 symptoms.20 As shown in Supplementary Table 8, for susceptibility, the
169 estimated liability heritability was h2 =0.00 (standard error [SE]=0.07). The estimated liability
170 heritability for hospitalization was h2=0.14 (SE=0.58); the large standard error is partly a result of the
171 small hospitalization sample size.
172
173 Discussion
174 To identify genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, we conducted GWAS of self-
175 reported COVID-19 outcomes in a population of survey respondents with European ancestry. To explore
176 possible differences in biological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analyzed both susceptibility
177 and severity outcomes via sex-stratified GWAS and sex-combined meta-analyses. In total, three novel
178 loci surpassed genome-wide significance in one or more study, with lead SNPs rs6668622 (male
179 susceptibility P=3.2x10-9), rs73166864 (susceptibility P=1.56x10-8), and rs111972040 (hospitalization
180 P=8.38x10-9) near IVNS1ABP, the immunoglobulin lambda locus, and SRRM1, respectively.
181
182 The most significantly associated SNP in any study was rs6668622 with the susceptibility outcome. The
183 nearest gene to rs6668622 is IVNS1ABP, which encodes Influenza Virus NS1A Binding Protein. This
184 protein is known to bind with influenza virulence factor NS1 and this interaction appears to promote
185 influenza viral gene expression.21 The variant rs6668622 is a known, strong expression quantitative trait
186 locus (eQTL) in lung tissue for IVNS1ABP22,23, suggesting that risk variation might impact mRNA
187 abundance of IVNS1ABP. Strikingly, haploinsufficiency of IVNS1ABP appears to associate with primary
188 immunodeficiency24, suggesting IVNS1ABP may play a role in cellular response to other pathogens
189 besides influenza. It is unclear why this association is only present only in males, though it may provide
190 a clue as to why males appear to be at higher risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and
191 mortality.7-12 We speculate that sex hormones or behavioral differences might trigger generally different
                                                                           8

192 cellular responses to SARS-Cov-2 infection in men and in women10, and one such difference may
193 involve differential expression of IVNS1ABP.
194
195 Another locus, represented by the intergenic lead SNP rs73166864, was associated with the
196 susceptibility outcome with similar effects in men and women. This signal is ~75Kb away from the
197 immunoglobulin lambda locus, a region that undergoes somatic recombination in B-cells and encodes
198 proteins used to construct the antigen-binding light chain region of antibodies.16 It is unclear what the
199 functional consequence of this intergenic variation might be, but proximity to such an important region
200 for antibody generation is intriguing.
201
202 The final locus, represented by the lead SNP rs111972040, was the only genome-wide significant
203 association with the hospitalization outcome. The variant rs111972040 is a non-coding transcript variant
204 in the gene SRRM1, which encodes Serine and Arginine Repetitive Matrix 1. A related gene, SRRM2,
205 was implicated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) splicing and replication.25 Based on this, we
206 hypothesize that SRRM1 may likewise play an important role in splicing SARS-Cov-2 viral genes.
207
208 In addition to identifying novel associations, the severity GWAS replicated findings from a previous
209 COVID-19 respiratory failure GWAS11 that identified two loci: the blood type ABO gene and a cluster
210 of immune genes near SLC6A20. We observed consistent directions of effect at both loci, but the
211 replication P-values were nominal, and we observed smaller estimated ORs; however, these
212 observations are not surprising. The original study considered a more severe outcome (respiratory
213 failure) than our analogous severity study (hospitalization). Furthermore, we included only 250 cases
214 that were hospitalized in our study relative to the 1,980 cases with respiratory failure in the Ellinghaus
215 study11, thus the nominal P-values in this study may simply reflect lower statistical power for our
                                                                           9

216 severity analysis. Lastly, the winner’s curse suggests that overestimated effect sizes are expected in the
217 discovery study.26
218
219 We estimated heritability for both outcomes to assess the contribution of common genetic variation to
220 COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. The liability heritability estimates were generally small: h2=0.00
221 (SE=0.07) for susceptibility and h2=0.14 (SE=0.58) for hospitalization. However, for hospitalization, the
222 sample sizes were small for this type of analysis and standard errors were correspondingly high. A key
223 assumption underlying the heritability estimates is that many small effects were distributed across the
224 entire genome19. Thus, the low heritability estimates might not simply reflect low genetic contribution,
225 but rather could suggest a genetic architecture involving a limited number of high-effect variants or a
226 large contribution by uncommon and rare variants.
227
228 A key limitation of our data is that COVID-19 cases who suffered very severe or fatal infections are less
229 likely to participate in our survey, which consequently results in undersampling cases with severe
230 outcomes. We also restricted to individuals of European ancestry due to small sample sizes in other
231 genetic ancestry cohorts for the susceptibility and severity outcomes in this early phase of COVID-19
232 survey data collection. As the COVID-19 survey cohort grows, future analyses will focus on increased
233 ancestral diversity to increase generalizability. Finally, we lack an independent replication cohort for our
234 novel findings and will rely on future ascertainment of additional survey respondents and COVID-19
235 GWAS consortia27 efforts to determine whether our findings are reproducible.
236
237 In summary, we collected over 500,000 self-reported COVID-19 outcomes in under two months and
238 conducted one of the largest genetic studies of infection susceptibility and severity to date, thus
239 demonstrating the value of large-scale self-reported data as a mechanism to rapidly address a serious
                                                                          10

240 health crisis. We identified three novel loci, all of which harbor genes with established roles in viral
241 replication or immunity, and one of which may provide insight into why men appear to be differently
242 affected by COVID-19 than women. We thus add to growing evidence that host genetic variation
243 contributes to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity and suggest identification of such genetic risk
244 factors may provide profound insight into pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus.

245 Methods
246 Ethics statement. All data for this research project was from subjects who provided prior informed
247 consent to participate in AncestryDNA’s Human Diversity Project, as reviewed and approved by our
248 external institutional review board, Advarra (formerly Quorum). All data was de-identified prior to use.
249
250 Study population. Self-reported COVID-19 outcomes were collected through the Personal Discoveries
251 Project®, a survey platform available to AncestryDNA customers via the web and mobile applications.
252 The COVID-19 survey ranged from 39-54 questions, depending on the initial COVID-19 test result
253 reported. Supplementary Figure 1 describes the flow of the topics assessed in each section of the
254 survey. The full questions and possible responses for the two questions used as primary outcomes in this
255 study are presented in Supplementary Table 1. Analyses presented here were performed with data
256 collected between April 22-May 28, 2020.
257
258 To participate in the COVID-19 survey, participants must meet the following criteria: they must be 18
259 years of age or older, a resident of the United States, be an existing AncestryDNA customer who has
260 consented to participate in research28, and be able to complete a short survey. The survey is designed to
261 assess self-reported COVID-19 positivity and severity, as well as susceptibility and known risk factors
262 including community exposure and known contacts with individuals diagnosed with COVID-19.
263
264 Phenotype definitions. Two phenotypes were assessed: one for susceptibility and one for severity of
265 COVID-19. Cases for the COVID-19 susceptibility phenotype were defined as individuals who
266 responded to the question, “Have you been swab tested for COVID-19, commonly referred to as
267 coronavirus?” as “Yes, and was positive”. Responders who answered “Yes, and was negative” were
268 defined as controls for the susceptibility study. Cases for the severity phenotype were defined as
                                                                          12

269 individuals who reported testing positive for COVID-19 and responded to the question, “Were you
270 hospitalized due to these symptoms?” as “Yes”. Severity controls reported testing positive for
271 COVID-19, but reported no hospitalization related to COVID-19.
272
273 Genotyping. Genotyping and quality control procedures have been previously described elsewhere.28
274 Briefly, customer genotype data for this study were generated using an Illumina genotyping array with
275 approximately 730,000 SNPs and processed either with Illumina or with Quest/Athena Diagnostics. To
276 ensure quality of each dataset, a sample passes a number of quality control (QC) checks, which includes
277 identifying duplicate samples, removing individuals with a per-sample call rate <98%, and identifying
278 discrepancies between reported sex and genetically inferred sex. Samples that pass all quality-control
279 tests proceed to the analysis pipeline; samples that fail one or more tests must be recollected or manually
280 cleared for analysis by lab technicians. Array markers with per-variant call rate <0.98 and array markers
281 that had overall allele frequency differences of >0.10 between any two array versions were additionally
282 removed prior to downstream analyses.
283
284 Selecting a European ancestry association cohort. As a measure to control population stratification,
285 we selected individuals with estimated European ancestry for inclusion in the GWAS. To determine
286 these definitions, a proprietary algorithm was used to estimate continental admixture proportions for all
287 COVID-19 survey respondents.29 Briefly, this algorithm uses a hidden Markov model to estimate
288 unphased diploid ancestry across the genome by comparing haplotype structure to a reference panel. The
289 reference panel consists of a combination of AncestryDNA customers and publicly available datasets
290 and is designed to reflect global diversity. From our total cohort of 506,743 individuals who participated
291 in the COVID-19 survey, 379,383 (74.9%) individuals with estimated European ancestry were retained
292 (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Figure 10).
                                                                          13

293
294 Removal of related individuals. AncestryDNA's identity-by-descent inference algorithm30 was used to
295 estimate the relationship between pairs of individuals. Pairs with estimated separation of fewer than four
296 meioses were considered close relatives. For all close relative pairs, one individual was randomly
297 selected for exclusion from our study. We excluded 1,741 individuals from the susceptibility analysis
298 and 223 from the severity analysis due to relatedness.
299
300 Calculation of principal components to control residual population structure. After selecting
301 unrelated individuals with European ancestry as described above, genetic PCs were calculated to include
302 in the association studies to control residual population structure and were computed using FlashPCA
303 2.0.31 Input genotypes were linkage disequilibrum (LD)-pruned using PLINK 1.9 command --indep-
304 pairwise 100 5 0.2 --maf 0.05 --geno 0.001.
305
306 Imputation. Samples were imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) reference panel32
307 version 1.1, which consists of 27,165 total individuals and 36 million variants. The HRC reference panel
308 does not include indels; consequently, indels are not present in the results of our analyses. We
309 determined best-guess haplotypes with Eagle version 2.4.133 and performed imputation with Minimac4
310 version 1.0.1.34 We used 1,117,080 unique variants as input and 8,049,082 imputed variants were
311 retained in the final data set. For these variants, we conservatively restricted our analyses to variants
312 minor allele frequency (MAF)>0.01 and Minimac4 R2>0.30 using genotype dosage probabilities for all
313 variants regardless of whether they were originally genotyped.
314
315 Statistical analyses. We used the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI) analysis plan version 1 to
316 guide our analyses.35 A key recommendation in this plan is to analyze males and females separately
                                                                          14

317 when possible; therefore, we conducted four separate GWAS in total: susceptibility in males,
318 susceptibility in females, hospitalization in males, and hospitalization in females. Sex was determined
319 from genotype data. For each GWAS, a fixed-effects logistic regression model was implemented with
320 PLINK2.0 with either the susceptibility or severity phenotype as the primary outcome and imputed
321 genotype dosage value as the primary predictor. The following were included as fixed-effect covariates:
322 PCs 1-12 (described above), array platform, orthogonal age, and orthogonal age2. Orthogonal
323 polynomials were used to eliminate collinearity between age and age2 and were calculated in R version
324 3.6.0 with base function poly(age, degree=2). We additionally used PLINK2.0 to remove
325 variants with Minimac4 imputation quality R2<0.3 or with MAF<0.01. The following PLINK2.0 flags
326 were used for each analysis:
327          --vcf [input imputed VCF] dosage=DS
328          --psam [file that provides sex information]
329          --covar [covariates file]
330          --covar-name PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4, PC5, PC6, PC7, PC8, PC9, PC10, PC11, PC12,
331          orthogonal_age, orthogonal_age2, platform
332          --covar-variance-standardize
333          --extract-if-info R2 >= 0.3
334          --freq
335          --glm hide-covar
336          --keep [list of unrelated Europeans]
337          --keep-females OR keep-males
338          --maf 0.01
339          --pheno [phenotype file]
340          --pheno-name [phenotype column name]
341
342 For each phenotype, summary statistics for males and females were combined using a fixed-effects
343 inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis, implemented with METAL36 (version released 25 March
344 2011). Unless otherwise noted, all variant ORs are adjusted for the 15 covariates described above.
                                                                          15

345
346 For all individual GWAS and meta-analyses, we considered the European genome-wide significance
347 threshold37 of two-tailed P<5x10-8 to represent a significant association. For lead SNPs at loci
348 surpassing P<5x10-8, we performed extended analyses in which we additionally adjusted for BMI and
349 self-reported affliction with one or more of any of the following health conditions: asthma, bone marrow
350 transplant, cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, COPD, diabetes, hypertension, organ failure
351 requiring transplant, autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency, and/or “other” lung condition.
352
353 Replication. To our knowledge, the only published GWAS of COVID-19 outcomes to date was
354 performed by Ellinghaus et al.11 We compared P-values and OR estimates from our analyses to the two
355 lead variants reported by Ellinghaus: rs657152, representing a region on chr 9 near ABO; and
356 rs11385942, representing a region on chr 3 near SLC6A20. The variant rs11385942 is a small indel and
357 indels are not present in the HRC reference panel; we therefore examined the association with
358 rs11385942 using rs17713054, a SNP in perfect LD (R2=1, D’=1) in a European population from
359 LDpair.38 The allele rs17713054-A corresponds to rs11385942-AG.
360
361 Heritability. To estimate heritability of COVID-19 phenotypes, we calculated phenotypic variance
362 explained by a genetic relatedness matrix (GRM) in the European GWAS cohort. To calculate the GRM,
363 we first performed LD-pruning of autosomal, imputed, high-quality (Minimac4 R2>0.3) best-guess
364 genotypes with PLINK-1.9 command --indep-pairwise 100 5 0.2 --maf 0.05 --geno
365 0.001 --chr 1-22, resulting in a total of 224,096 variants. From these variants, GCTA version
366 1.91.5 beta2 was used to estimate a GRM.18 We subset the resulting matrix to unrelated individuals (--
367 grm-cutoff 0.025) and individuals with diagonal elements between 0.95-1.05, resulting in a final
368 GRM consisting of 18,415 subjects. These 18,415 individuals are candidates for the two heritability
369 analyses.
                                                                          16

370
371 Next, we performed single component heritability estimation for each phenotype by fitting a linear
372 mixed model (GCTA-GREML)18. Each model included PCs 1-12, array platform, sex inferred from
373 genotype data, orthogonal age, and orthogonal age2 as fixed effects. For each phenotype, the model also
374 included a random genetic effect with the covariance given by a GRM calculated with the intersection of
375 the 18,415 heritability individuals and those with non-missing phenotypes using the same 224,096
376 variants described above.
377
378 The observed heritability was estimated using the GCTA command --grm [phenotype-
379 specific GRM] --reml --pheno [phenotype file] --covar [genetic sex,
380 platform] --qcovar [PCs 1-12, orthogonal_age, orthogonal_age2]. The
381 liability heritability was estimated from the observed heritability using the standard transformation39 and
382 the sample prevalence using the GCTA command above with --prevalence [sample
383 prevalence].
