          ABSTRACT
          Background Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is a broad category of drill-and-practice
          interventions aims to maintain cognitive performance in older adults. Despite a supportive evidence
          base for general efficacy, it is unclear what types of CCT are most likely to be beneficial and what
          intervention design factors are essential for clinical implementation.
          Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to August 2019 for randomized controlled
          trials (RCTs) of any type of CCT in cognitively healthy older adults. Risk of bias within studies was
          assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. The primary outcome was change in overall
          cognitive performance between CCT and control groups. Secondary outcomes were individual
          cognitive domains. A series of meta-regressions were performed to estimates associations between
          key design factors and overall efficacy using robust variance estimation models. Network meta-
          analysis was used to compare the main approaches to CCT against passive or common active control
          conditions.
          Results Ninety RCTs encompassing 7219 participants across 117 comparisons were included. The
          overall cognitive effect size across all trials was small (g=0.18, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.23) with
          considerable heterogeneity (τ2=0.074, 95% prediction interval -0.36 to 0.73), robust to small-study
          effect or risk of bias. Effect sizes for individual cognitive domains were small, heterogeneous and
          statistically significant apart from fluid intelligence and visual processing. Meta-regressions revealed
          significantly larger effect sizes in trials using supervised training or up to three times per week.
          Multidomain training was the most efficacious CCT approach against any type of control, with
          greater benefits in a subset of supervised training studies.
          Conclusions The efficacy of CCT varies substantially across designs, independent of the type of
          control. Multidomain supervised CCT appears to be the most efficacious approach, and should be
          developed to accommodate for individual needs and remote delivery settings. Future research should
          focus on identifying the intervention components and regimens that could attenuate aging-related
          cognitive decline.

          INTRODUCTION
          While cognitive decline is a highly common aspect of normal aging, interventions that can support
          cognitive function in older adults may have far-reaching health and societal implications, including
          delaying or preventing insidious progress towards mild cognitive impairment and dementia.1 In an
          evidence commissioned by the National Institutes of Aging, the National Academy of Medicine2
          defined cognitive training as one of the three highest priority areas for prevention research, along with
          physical activity and blood pressure management. The World Health Organization guidelines for
          prevention of cognitive decline and dementia3 was similarly supportive of cognitive training, albeit
          based on low-quality evidence. Yet these conclusions were drawn based on an array of cognitive
          training interventions compared to various control conditions, leaving no guidance on how their
          recommendations might be implemented.
          Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is a highly common cognitive training approach, based on
          repeated exercise repeated and controlled practice on exercises that target specific cognitive
          processes. CCT can be adapted to individual needs, is inherently safe and can be delivered
          inexpensively at scale in various clinical and community settings. About a dozen meta-analyses have
          investigated the efficacy of CCT in healthy older adults, generally reporting benefits for overall
          cognition.4 The largest to date, encompassing 51 randomized controlled trials (RCTs),5 found that
          efficacy could be moderated by delivery settings and session frequency but did not find differences
          across types of CCT and control conditions. Regardless, legitimate concerns regarding the overall
          quality of evidence and variability of methods in the field as well as misleading marketing practices
          by the “brain training” industry have driven skepticism towards CCT.6 Lack of clarity regarding
          which CCT approaches might be beneficial are therefore a clear impediment towards translating the
          recommendations into practice. Thus, we aimed to update and extend the findings of our previous
          systematic review of the field,4 with a particular focus on comparing the main CCT methods to the
          most common control conditions.

          METHODS
          We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)
          statement7,8 and prospectively registered the protocol PROSPERO (CRD42018114891). Eligibility
          criteria and search strategy follow our previous systematic review of the same topic.5
          Eligibility criteria
          We considered randomized trials comparing change from baseline to post-training in one or more
          cognitive measure between CCT and control conditions in cognitively healthy older adults. CCT was
          defined as ≥4 h of practice on standardized computerized tasks or video games with clear cognitive
          rationale, administered on personal computers, mobile devices, or gaming consoles. Eligible controls
          included wait lists, alternative cognitive activities (e.g., psychoeducation) or sham conditions (e.g.,
          low-level practice). Combinations of CCT with other interventions (e.g., physical exercise) were
          included if controls received the same adjacent intervention. When combined interventions were
          compared to passive control, trials were included if CCT comprised at least 50% of intervention time.
          Outcome measures that closely resembled one of more of the trained tasks were excluded.
          Information sources and study selection
          We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO using the search terms “cognitive training” OR
          “brain training” OR “memory training” OR “attention training” OR “reasoning training” OR
          “computerized training” OR “computer training” OR “video game” OR “computer game”. No search
          or language limits were applied. The first search was done from inception July 2014.5 Search updates
          were applied on November 2015, February 2018 and August 2019. In each update, two or more
          independent reviewers performed abstract screening and assessment of full-text articles against the
          inclusion criteria. A senior reviewer [AL, HMG or GP] was responsible for consolidation of eligibility
          assessments and resolution of disagreements among reviewers. The final set of included studies was
          reviewed and approved by AL.
          Data items and coding

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208306.this version posted October 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

          Since CCT studies typically report multiple outcome measures, all eligible measures were collected.
          Efficacy data were collected as mean and standard deviation (SD) for each group at each time point,
          or assessed using measures of change (e.g., pre-post mean and SD of change within groups). We
          contacted authors when reports provided insufficient data to calculate an effect size or when data for
          certain outcome measures were not reported. In multi-arm studies, all eligible arms were included (for
          a list of included arms from each study, see Table 1). Definitions of contrasts for the NMA
          occasionally differed from the pairwise meta-analyses, especially in multi-arm trials to reflect all
          available comparisons. Coding CCT and active control conditions into specific types was done based
          on the content of the intervention. Coding of outcome measures into specific cognitive domains was
          done based on the Cattell-Horn-Carroll- Miyake framework.9
          Risk of bias within studies
          We used the 2019 Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool10 (RoB2) to assess risk of bias across five domains
          (randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement
          of the outcome, selection of the reported result). In addition, each study received an overall RoB
          assessment of high, low or some concerns. In contrast to the original RoB2 macros, studies that did
          not report assessor blinding or intention-to-treat results were coded as high risk of bias regardless of
          other RoB2 items.
          Statistical analysis
          Analyses were conducted using the R packages robumeta,11 clubSandwich12 and netmeta.13 The
          primary outcome was overall cognition, defined as a composite of all eligible outcomes reported in
          each trial.5 Secondary outcomes were individual cognitive domains. Between-group differences in
          each outcome measure were converted to standardized mean differences and calculated as Hedges’ g
          with 95% CI. Pairwise analyses were performed using robust variation estimation14 (RVE) with
          robumeta, based on correlational dependence model with r=0.8. Heterogeneity across studies was
          quantified using τ2 and expressed as a proportion of overall observed variance using the I2 statistic.15
          Prediction intervals were calculated to assess the dispersion of true effects across studies.16 RVE
          meta-regressions based on prespecified categorical moderators were performed using robumeta and

          formally tested for between-group differences based on F-statistic using clubSandwich. Small-study
          effect for the primary outcome was investigated by visually inspecting funnel plots of effect size vs
          standard error and formally tested using the Egger’s test as a meta-regression in RVE.17,18
          Second, random-effects network meta-analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes was
          performed using a frequentist framework using netmeta. Network geometry was summarized in a
          network graph and league tables were created to display the relative effect sizes of all available
          comparisons. Ranking of treatments were estimated using P-scores, representing the extent of
          certainty that an intervention is more effective than another intervention19. Higher P-scores represent
          higher likelihood of a certain intervention to be the more effective. To examine the transitivity
          assumptions, we created a table summarizing potential effect modifiers (design characteristics and
          risk of bias) to explore whether these were similarly distributed across the different comparisons.
          Sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome were conducted for subsets of supervised and home-based
          training studies.
          RESULTS
          After accounting for duplicates within and across searches, we screened 14,361 unique titles, of which
          762 full-text articles were assessed against the inclusion criteria, resulting in 90 eligible RCTs
          encompassing 7219 participants (Fig 1). Fourteen RCTs were identified from manual searches and
          four potentially eligible RCTs were excluded because the reports did not provide sufficient data for
          analysis and authors did not provide data following our requests.
          Characteristics of included studies
          Key study characteristics are reported in Table 1. The 90 RCTs included 117 eligible CCT and
          control arms. The most common type of CCT was multidomain training (n=36 RCTs), followed by
          working memory training (n=21) and attention/dual task CCT (n=10). Fifty-nine trials (66%)
          compared CCT to at least one active control condition, of which 11 included an additional passive

          control group, and 7 trials included more than one CCT arm (Figure 2). Overall risk of bias was
          assessed as low in 21 trials, high in 36, and 29 had some concerns (Table 1).
          Primary outcome: Overall cognition
          The pooled overall effect size across all 90 RCTs (1211 effect sizes, median 10 effect sizes per study)
          was small (g=0.18, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.23) with considerable heterogeneity (τ2=0.074, I2=58%). The
          95% prediction interval indicated high variability in overall effect sizes across settings (-0.36 to 0.73).
          There was no evidence for small-study effect (β=0.35, one-tailed p=0.117, Figure 3). There was no
          evidence for difference across levels of risk of bias (F2,64.8=0.391, p=0.678).
          Meta-regressions
          Results of meta-regressions for the primary outcome are provided in Table 2. The pooled effect size
          was significant larger for supervised vs home-based training (F1,68.5=5.8, p=0.019) and for training 1-3
          times per week vs more frequent regimens (F1,71.2=4.9, p=0.029). Session length, treatment duration
          and total hours of training were not associated with overall cognitive effect size. Compared to studies
          that used supervised training, home-based training studies tended to provide more frequent (t74.8=8.82,
          p<0.001) and shorter sessions (t87.5=-3.67, p<0.001), as well as more hours of training (t55.4=2.19,
          p=0.032). Multiple meta-regressions did not find interactions between delivery mode and any dosing
          factor.
          Secondary outcomes: Individual cognitive domains
          Meta-analyses of individual cognitive domains are provided in Table 3. Effect sizes across the six
          domains were generally small and heterogeneous. There was no evidence for benefit on fluid
          intelligence, and the pooled estimate for visual processing did not reach statistical significance.
          Network meta-analysis: Primary outcome
          The 90 RCTs provided 131 pairwise comparisons across 13 CCT or control conditions, resulting in a
          well-connected network structure (Figure 2). Direct evidence was available for 32 comparisons, most
          notably multidomain vs no contact (20 RCTs), multidomain vs CS/Education (19 RCTs) and working
          memory training vs sham (14 RCTs). There was evidence for inconsistency for four comparisons; the

          direct effect size was larger than the indirect estimate for multidomain vs no contact and speed vs
          casual computer games, and smaller for speed vs no contact (Table 4).
          Across all trials, multidomain training ranked highest for efficacy on overall cognition, with small and
          statistically significant effect sizes over and above passive control (g=0.21, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.30) and
          all active control conditions apart from physical exercise (Table 4). Processing speed training was
          ranked second with similar but slightly smaller estimates. Working memory training was better than
          all control conditions apart from cognitive stimulation. There was no evidence for cognitive benefit of
          any active control condition over and above no contact control.
          When separating supervised and home-based training studies, only multidomain training was found to
          be more efficacious than passive control (g=0.30, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.41) and CS/Education (g=0.25,
          95% CI 0.14 to 0.36). There was no evidence of benefit for any home-based condition. Finally, an
          RVE analysis of the 21 RCTs that used supervised multidomain CCT revealed a similar estimate
          (g=0.30, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.40), with about half the heterogeneity of the full model (τ2=0.037, I2=36%).
          Of these, 19 provided training up to 3 times per week, resulting in nearly identical estimates (g=0.30,
          95% CI 0.19 to 0.41, τ2=0.038, I2=38%).
          Secondary outcomes
          Network meta-analyses ranking for individual domains are presented in Figure 4. The CCT types
          ranked highest and reported statistically significant benefits were multidomain (g=0.24, 95% CI 0.10
          to 0.38) and working memory training (g=0.22, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.38) for executive functions, speed
          (g=0.36, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.65) and multidomain (g=0.26, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.46) for long-term memory
          and retrieval, speed (g=0.61, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.83) and multidomain (g=0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.54) for
          processing speed, and attention/dual task (g=0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.72) and multidomain (g=0.19,
          95% CI 0.05 to 0.32) for general short-term memory. Analyses of fluid intelligence and visual
          processing did not identify statistically significant benefits for any CCT type.

          DISCUSSION
          This multivariate and network meta-analysis of 90 RCTs has confirmed the efficacy of CCT and
          narrowed down the conditions in which CCT can result in cognitive benefits in healthy older adults.
          Our results suggest that multidomain CCT as the most sensible approach to improving global and
          domain-specific cognitive performance in this population, and that these effects can be further
          augmented by implementing supervised settings across up to three weekly sessions. However, trials
          that used supervised CCT were also more likely to provide less frequent sessions, and therefore it was
          not possible to examine whether these two factors are independent effect modifiers.
          Furthermore, comparisons of common active control conditions (general cognitive stimulation, sham
          CCT and computer games) do not point to a benefit over and above no-contact (passive) control,
          suggesting that these are ineffectual not only as stand-alone interventions, but also as a means to
          control for non-specific (‘placebo’) effects in CCT trials apart from those associated with repeated
          testing.
          The effect size estimates for the primary outcome as well as lack of evidence for small-study effect or
          association with risk of bias are consistent with our previous meta-analysis,5 and so are the role of
          supervision and session frequency as effect modifiers. The current meta-analysis included 40
          additional RCTs that meet the same stringent eligibility criteria and used more efficient methods to
          handle dependent effect sizes in meta-regressions. Thus, these findings are likely to be robust and
          substantially increase the certainty in the RCT evidence for the general efficacy of CCT.
          Given the wealth of RCTs, reasonable certainty in the evidence and lack of evidence to support the
          efficacy of active or passive control conditions, clinical equipoise assumptions in CCT trials are
          becoming increasingly difficult to justify. That is, the new knowledge gained from clinical trials
          comparing CCT programs to inert control may not necessarily be substantial enough to withhold
          potentially effective intervention from older participants.20 At the same time, the opportunity cost of
          testing relatively basic efficacy hypotheses (‘does CCT work?’) instead of addressing clinical
          implementation challenges in the field is increasing. Specifically, in order to test the effectiveness of
          CCT as a means to prevent cognitive decline at scale, research that focuses on maintaining

          engagement over time, providing remote supervision akin to that of center-based training and
          personalizing CCT, among other research priorities. These would require larger and longer studies
          that those typically conducted in the field but allow investigations of novel approaches compared to
          existing CCT programs.
          Our network meta-analysis highlights the importance of multidomain training as the CCT approach
          most likely to be beneficial. Several meta-analyses of single domain training have shown that training
          gains tend to be most pronounced within the domains targeted by the program.21,22 Lack of robust
          evidence for gains in untrained domains is often cited as a limitation of CCT but in fact this is simply
          the reality of most interventions targeting a specific physiological or mental process. From a clinical
          implementation perspective, targeted CCT may be clinically relevant for rehabilitation of specific
          cognitive deficits, such as a recent FDA-approved attention training program for children with
          attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.23 However, given age-related cognitive decline affects
          multiple domains and typically measured using global cognitive batteries, clinicians and researchers
          should expect the greater generalizability from multidomain CCT. Several methods for adapting
          training content to individual cognitive profiles have been developed and are currently undergoing
          clinical trials, especially within multicomponent dementia prevention trials.24 What methods can
          increase the efficacy of CCT and, importantly, whether these can slow down cognitive decline
          remains to be investigated in future trials and more specific meta-analysis methods.
          Limitations
          To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest systematic review of CCT in older adults to date, and
          the first to perform a network meta-analysis. Since trials tend to report multiple outcome measures,
          we used RVE analyses to account for non-independence of effect sizes within studies. Whereas this is
          an efficient approach that allowed us to detect more heterogeneity and increase the power of meta-
          regression analyses, a limitation of RVE is that it allows to model dependence due to nesting of
          multiple outcome measures (correlational model) or groups within studies (hierarchal model), but not
          both. We used a correlational model as nearly all studies reported multiple outcome measures while

          only 23 reported more than two eligible arms. Consequently, estimations of weights and heterogeneity
          did not account for possible differences between subgroups, which may have affected the efficiency
          of the model specifications.14 A method for combining the two working models has been very
          recently proposed25 and may counter this problem in future meta-analyses.
          Accounting for dependency in a network meta-analysis is even more challenging,26 and we are not
          aware of viable solutions for generating arm-level composites at this stage. To limit the effect of this
          problem on our estimates we combined effect sizes within arms into a single estimate using the same
          correlation-based method27 used in our previous univariate meta-analysis of CCT.5 Despite applying a
          large coefficient (r=0.8, as in the RVE model) for estimated correlated variance within arms, there
          was no detectable heterogeneity in the full network, limiting the precision of our estimates.
          Nevertheless, imprecision of the main analysis was not substantially greater than the RVE estimates,
          and arguably less prone to bias compared to selection of outcome measures.
          Finally, we did not include data beyond post-training assessments for two main reasons. First,
          including such data will introduce selection bias as the majority of studies implemented relatively
          short training periods and did not report long-term outcomes, with considerable variation in the
          number and length of follow-ups. Second, while some residual gains can still be apparent several
          months and perhaps up to a year after a course of CCT, effects are expected to wane over time
          without further training.28,29 There is therefore limited value in testing hypotheses related to effect
          maintenance as the null is the most likely outcome, especially as effects are measured further away
          from training cessation. Given the ultimate goal of CCT is to delay cognitive decline, implementing
          and optimizing long-term booster schedules is the key to maintain CCT effects and should be
          prioritized over more conventional trial designs that focus on modelling the gradual waning of
          cognitive gains.
          CONCLUSIONS
          CCT is efficacious for overall and domain-specific cognitive performance in healthy older adults, but
          effect vary across key intervention design factors. Greater efficacy should be expected from
          multidomain CCT, applied up to 3 times per week, and provided in supervised settings. Future trials

          should avoid inert control conditions whenever possible and focus on optimizing training protocol,
          specifically in home settings. Research synthesis efforts can move away from investigating mere
          efficacy and focus on detecting more specific intervention components and individual predictors of
          training response.
