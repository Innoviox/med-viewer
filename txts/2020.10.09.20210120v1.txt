    ABSTRACT
    Purpose: To investigate the inter-reader agreement for grading of retinal alterations in
    age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using a reading center setting.
    Methods: In this cross-sectional case series, spectral domain optical coherence
    tomography (OCT, Topcon 3D OCT, Tokyo, Japan) scans of 112 eyes of 112 patients
    with neovascular AMD (56 treatment-naive, 56 after three anti-vascular endothelial
    growth factor injections) were analyzed by four independent readers. Imaging features
    specific for AMD were annotated using a novel custom-built annotation platform. Dice
    score, Bland-Altman plots, coefficients of repeatability (CR), coefficients of variation
    (CV), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were assessed.
    Results: Loss of ellipsoid zone, pigment epithelium detachment, subretinal fluid, and
    Drusen were the most abundant features in our cohort. The features subretinal fluid,
    intraretinal fluid, hypertransmission, descent of the outer plexiform layer, and pigment
    epithelium detachment showed highest inter-reader agreement, while detection and
    measures of loss of ellipsoid zone and retinal pigment epithelium were more variable.
    The agreement on the size and location of the respective annotation was more
    consistent throughout all features.
    Conclusions: The inter-reader agreement depended on the respective OCT-based
    feature. A selection of reliable features might provide suitable surrogate markers for
    disease progression and possible treatment effects focusing on different disease
    stages.

    INTRODUCTION
    Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of legal blindness in the
    industrialized world.1 Concerning advanced disease manifestations, a dry stage defined
    by the presence of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and outer retinal atrophy (RORA,
    also called ‘geographic atrophy’, GA) can be distinguished from or complicated by a
    neovascular (nAMD) form typically characterized by the presence of choroidal
    neovascularization (CNV).2–4
    While both forms of late stage AMD are associated with the risk of visual loss, an
    effective treatment for RORA development and progression is still pending. However,
    various therapeutic approaches are tested in different stages of preclinical and clinical
    trials.5,6 In order to accelerate clinical testing, meaningful, validated clinical endpoints
    are needed.7 Most interventional trials currently rely on the progression of RORA which
    is an accepted endpoint by regulators.8,9 However, the most effective upcoming
    therapeutic approach might be directed to earlier disease stages.10 Therefore, ideal
    surrogate markers should identify early disease-associated alterations before the
    hitherto unknown point-of-no return.11 A current paper dealing with RORA in
    mitochondriopathies described a consistent sequence of optical coherence tomography
    (OCT)-based imaging features in the development of RORA representing different
    disease stages.12 As an international consensus, the Classification of Atrophy Meetings
    (CAM) group not only defined complete RORA but also reported preceding OCT-
    features for AMD.13,14 However, the reliability of the detection and quantification of some
    of these features has not yet been systematically and comprehensively investigated.
                                                                                                                                        4

    Nevertheless, they have already been implemented by reading centers for current and
    upcoming observational and interventional trials.13,15,16
    Concerning nAMD, the therapy with intraocular injection of anti-vascular endothelial
    growth factor (anti-VEGF) has been shown to be effective and reduces the risk of visual
    loss.17,18 However, the numbers and costs of required visits mean a significant burden
    on health-care systems, medical personal, and patients, in particular in the light of
    growing numbers due to demographic changes and rising life expectation. 19 Therefore,
    personalized interval and treatment strategies (i.a. ‘Treat & Extend’) are used more
    commonly in current clinical settings.20,21 In this context, objective and reliable features
    to determine disease activity are crucial. OCT is typically used for monitoring as it
    provides cross-sectional images of the retina that allow to identify presence as well as
    extent of these features.22,23 Usually, the feature identification is manually performed by
    human investigators. Machine learning applications are progressively entering this field,
    especially in the context of potential deployment of in home or remote OCT
    monitoring.24 However, the “gold-standard” by which these algorithms are trained and
    validated is conventionally human grading. This might raise the question concerning
    reliability, subjectivity, and bias of the treatment decisions.25
    In this study, we therefore investigate the reliability of the grading of defined OCT
    features commonly found in the development of RORA and/or in the presence of CNV
    secondary to AMD in order to provide estimates for human inter-reader agreement for
    each of these features. Thereby, we focus on the detection, as well as the size and the
    overlap of the particular annotations.

    METHODS
    This retrospective cross-sectional case series was performed at the Moorfields Eye
    Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. To identify AMD patients, we linked the
    diagnosis to OCT images of the electronic medical records database (Medisoft, Leeds,
    UK) of five centers in the United Kingdom using pseudonymized identifiers. The imaging
    data comprised 6 x 6 mm foveal centered OCT volume scans obtained by spectral-
    domain OCT (Topcon, Tokyo, Japan). Any other additional ocular pathology (including
    prior clinically significant macular oedema), prior unlicensed Bevacizumab injections,
    intraocular surgery within 90 days, or prior macular or panretinal photocoagulation led to
    exclusion. Thereby, this study included imaging data of 112 eyes of 112 AMD patients
    at different disease stages. Half of these eyes were treatment-naive, the others were
    imaged after three anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections. The study
    was in adherence with the declaration of Helsinki. The Institutional Review Board ruled
    that approval was not required for this study, because all data was completely
    anonymized before being released to research.
    Image analysis
    In order to assess the reliability of grading retinal alterations in AMD, a single OCT
    B-scan per eye was randomly selected for annotation. The other B-scans were available
    to give additional context if needed. Annotations were performed by four independent
    trained retinal specialists masked to the results of each other using a custom-build
                                                                                                                                        6

    platform (Supplementary Figure S1). All retinal abnormalities were to be delineated. The
    platform provided default labels for the most common abnormalities (including those
    described by the CAM group)13,14 and allowed the readers to add additional labels not
    covered by the default setup. Depending on the feature, it was annotated either as area,
    lateral extent, or number (i.e., single dots in features with pointwise presentation),
    likewise for all readers. Preset default labels included drusen, loss of ellipsoid loss (EZ),
    hyperreflective dots (HRD), hypertransmission of OCT-signal (HT), hyporeflective
    wedges, intraretinal fluid (IRF), descent of outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer retinal
    tubulations, pigment epithelial detachment (PED), loss of retinal pigment epithelium
    (RPE), reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), subretinal fluid (SRF), subretinal hyperreflective
    material (SRHM), and sub-RPE plaques (Supplementary Figure S1).
    The annotated images were then evaluated using Python (version 3.8.2). In order to
    obtain the area measures in mm² and lateral extent measures in mm, the extracted
    values of annotated features (i.e., in pixels² and pixels) were multiplied by the individual
    scaling factor depending on the scanning protocol. Further statistical analysis was
    exclusively made for features present in at least 20 annotated B-scans respectively
    eyes to ensure reliable results.
    Statistical analysis
    The software environment R (version 4.0.2, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
    Vienna, Austria)26 was used for inter-reader correlations. To compare the reliability of
                                                                                                                                        7

    feature detection, Fleiss coefficients were used.27 To measure the agreement in the
    annotated feature size, lateral extent or number, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC,
    one-way random), 95% coefficients of repeatability (CR) and coefficients of variation
    (CV) were determined.28–30 To account for the unbalanced number of readings per
    sample, a linear mixed-effects model was used. Bland-Altman plots were generated
    from slices with annotations of at least two readers for visualization of limits of
    agreement. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (ρ) were calculated between the
    absolute differences and the mean values to evaluate whether measurement variability
    increases with lesion size or number.29
    To measure overlap in annotated areas, we calculated the Dice similarity metric using
    Python (version 3.8.2) whenever more than one reader annotated the same feature
    within a respective B-scan. It is defined as the size of the intersection of two areas
    divided by their average individual size, ranging from 0 (indicating no spatial overlap) to
    1 (indicating complete overlap).31 For area measures, overlap was calculated on voxel-
    level. For lateral extent measures, only the lateral location of the feature was taken into
    account. The mean Dice-coefficients per feature is reported. Due to their focal nature,
    the Dice-coefficient was not regarded an appropriate metric for annotations of HRD.
                                                                                                                                        8

    RESULTS
    In 111 out of the included 112 OCT B-scans, at least one pathologic feature was
    annotated. Hyporeflective wedges, outer retinal tubulations, RPD and sub-RPE plaques
    were present but excluded from analysis due to their rarity in the respective scans
    (presence in less than 20 annotated B-scans). In total, ten features were used for
    further analysis (Table 1). Out of the latter group, EZ-loss, Drusen, and PED were the
    most abundant features.
    The feature detection at the B-scan level (i.e., the individual lesion level is important
    when investigating progression) revealed variable inter-reader agreement (Table 1).
    The most reliable results could be found in SRF and IRF, that account to neovascular
    complications, as well as the features HT, OPL-descent, and PED. Only slight to
    moderate inter-reader agreement could be found in the detection of EZ-loss and RPE-
    loss.27
    The evaluation of inter-reader agreement concerning the size, lateral extension or
    number of annotated features at the B-scan level revealed more consistent results. All
    ICC values ranged from moderate to excellent correlation (Table 2).32 The focality (i.e.,
    number of individual annotated spots) measures of HRD revealed the lowest ICC with
    values over 0.50. The features with the highest scores for inter-reader agreement of
    annotated size, lateral extension or number were PED, SRF, HT and OPL-descent in
    our cohort (ICC > 0.85, Figure 1).
                                                                                                                                        9

    The Bland-Altman plots did not reveal systematic inter-reader discrepancies (Figure 2
    and Supplementary Figures S2 to S11). However, the inter-reader variability increased
    with annotated area or number according to Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ)
    for absolute differences and mean values for measures of Drusen (ρ = 0.317 to ρ =
    0.828, P < 0.001 to P = 0.049), PED (ρ = 0.316 to ρ = 0.605, P < 0.001 to P = 0.042),
    and HRD (ρ = 0.509 to ρ = 0.761, P < 0.001 to P = 0.018). The area measures of IRF (ρ
    = 0.311 to ρ = 0.755, P < 0.001 to P = 0.139), SRF (ρ = 0.326 to ρ = 0.517, P = 0.003 to
    P = 0.062), and SRHM (ρ = 0.150 to ρ = 0.436, P = 0.170 to P = 0.708), as well as
    lateral distance measures of EZ-loss (ρ = 0.010 to ρ = 0.297, P = 0.021 to P = 0.936),
    HT (ρ = 0.021 to ρ = 0.550, P = 0.027 to P = 0.921), OPL-descent (ρ = 0.036 to ρ =
    0.455, P = 0.066 to P = 0.964), and RPE-loss (ρ = 0.108 to ρ = 0.748, P < 0.001 to P =
    0.818) did not show this correlation.
    More reliable than size, extent, or number of annotated features, the Dice-coefficients
    revealed consistent values over 0.5 (up to >0.75, Table 3) for all features. This indicated
    a distinct overlap of annotated regions and therefore uniform localization of the features
    (Figure 1).

    DISCUSSION
    In this study, we systematically investigated the reliability of grading an extensive
    number of structural OCT features associated with different stages of AMD in a reading
    center setting. The presented findings provided evidence for the dependence of inter-
    reader agreement on the respective annotated feature. Hence, the appropriate selection
    of features has the potential to provide suitable surrogate markers for disease
    progression and possible therapeutic effects on different disease stages in upcoming
    interventional trials.
    Clinical surrogate markers are needed to accelerate future interventional trials. Best
    corrected visual acuity loss does not always constitute a useful endpoint in clinical trials
    for AMD due to its high interindividual variability, its psychophysical nature and
    phenomena such as foveal non-involvement.33 Nevertheless, most interventional trials
    for neovascular AMD currently rely on this feature. In contrast, studies for dry AMD
    usually use morphologic endpoints like RORA (e.g. by semiautomated delineation in
    fundus autofluorescence imaging)34 as an accepted endpoint by regulators.8,9 However,
    RORA represents the end-stage of AMD and the most effective upcoming therapeutic
    approach might be directed to earlier disease stages, which is difficult to extrapolate
    from preclinical data.10 Ideal surrogate markers, therefore, should (I) be readily
    captured, (II) reflect the current disease stage, (III) be reliable, and (IV) ideally be
    predictive for long-term progression based on short-term changes.35

    As the OCT is the most abundant digital imaging device in modern ophthalmology, it
    has already been implemented in routine patient assessment and most clinical trial
    designs for retinopathies.36 For neovascular AMD, the analysis of IRF and SRF is used
    to evaluate disease activity and treatment indication besides drop of vision, presence of
    bleedings or leakage in angiography.21,37 It has been shown to be an objective and
    susceptible measure that might even precede functional impairment and be faster
    executed and/or more comfortable than invasive imaging technology like angiography or
    fundus photography.21,22,38 For dry AMD, multimodal assessment (including OCT) of
    drusen, pigment epithelial alterations or signs of RORA is inevitable in the differential
    diagnosis and analysis of disease progression.15 The evaluation of additional or
    individual OCT features could therefore be effectively carried out.
    A current publication showed a consistent sequence of OCT-features in the
    development of RORA secondary to Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness
    (MIDD), indicating that these features represent different disease stages. 12 Given that
    MIDD is a mitochondriopathy and mitochondrial dysfunction is considered part of the
    pathophysiology in AMD, results obtained in that model disease might be partly
    transferred to AMD. Indeed, an international consensus published by the CAM group
    indicated most of these features to be associated RORA development secondary to
    AMD.13,14 It also described features like EZ-loss, RPE-loss, HT, OPL-descent, HRD,
    and SRHM. However, the reliability of these features has not yet been comprehensively
    investigated by this group.

    Reliability might be the most important prerequisites to define a surrogate marker for
    patient assessment and future interventional clinical trials. Rather low inter-reader
    agreement was found in the detection of the features EZ-loss and RPE-loss. Reliability
    of size and location of both feature annotations, however, were distinctly higher, while
    ICC did not reach levels of previous published data (0.75 for RPE-loss).39 However, the
    latter uses another OCT device (Spectralis HRA-OCT) that might have led to better
    image quality. Some of the differences between readers might be due to inaccurate
    delineation of lesion borders as loss and attenuation of RPE and/or EZ might merge
    (Figure 1). Interestingly, the average relative difference between two readers for RPE-
    loss was indicated with 72.4 which was significantly higher than the CV (44.8) in our
    study, while both measures are thought to be independent from lesion size. Concerning
    HRD, the variable number might derive from the size of the feature. Readers might have
    simply overlooked small features, leading to not more than moderate reliability (Figure
    1). In this context, an automated artificial intelligence-based feature detection might
    have great potential to overcome this human limitation.40,41 Moreover, deep learning and
    its broader family, machine learning, is likely to be the only way to quantitate large
    volumes of dense OCT raster scans that are being generated in clinical trial reading
    centers, busy clinical practices and emerging home/remote OCT devices. 42 However,
    the machine learning algorithms will be trained and the performance will be judged by
    the human “gold standard”,43 which, if unreliable, may be problematic.
    More consistent results could be found for SRF and IRF. Here, our results revealed high
    inter-reader agreement in all three investigated parameters (detection, size, and
                                                                                                                                     13

    location, Figure 1). This was in line with previously published data.44 Despite different
    datasets, the here described ICC between readers were higher than the ICC derived
    from inter-modality reliability between spectral domain and time domain OCT.45,46 Given
    that both features reflect neovascular activity and guide the indication for anti-VEGF
    treatment (besides other clinical features including hemorrhage and loss of vision), this
    might be of particular importance. A recent study has investigated the inter-reader
    agreement of PED size measures and reported an ICC of over 0.99.47 The slightly
    higher ICC value (our study, 0.972) might be traced back to the fact that the latter has
    only included 20 eye with definite presence of PED ,and did not parallelly focus on other
    retinal alterations.
    We noted a high reliability of the HT feature, supporting previously published.39 In
    contrast, no previous report has systematically investigated inter-reader agreement of
    OPL-descent. Given the high reliability (Table 1-3) and appearance in the development
    of RORA,13 OPL-descent would be worth further investigations and to explore its
    potential as possible surrogate marker in future clinical trials as well as for training
    machine learning algorithms.
    Interestingly, the reliability of OCT-based features annotation for e.g. SRF, HT, and
    PED reached the reliability of RORA grading in fundus autofluorescence imaging in
    different diseases including AMD.35,48–50 However, OCT imaging uses less energetic
    infrared light that minimizes potential light toxicity and is more comfortable for the
    patient.48,51 Furthermore, OCT imaging does not rely on pupil dilation and devices are
    more common that fundus autofluorescence imaging devices. 36 In this context, OCT-
                                                                                                                                     14

    scans were selected in a randomized manner in our study. A previous study revealed
    that more eccentric scan locations might lead to less reliable results.44 Therefore, the
    pure evaluation of central scans might have led to even higher inter-reader agreement.
    Nevertheless, additional features of summation images like shape-descriptive
    parameters or dynamic flow signal could give further information,49,50,52 suggesting a
    multimodal assessment as gold standard in AMD diagnosis and study design at the
    current stage of imaging technology.15
    It has been shown by the AREDS study that the number and size of drusen might
    predict progression of AMD.53 Also, the presentation of HRD,54 and the size of baseline
    RORA55 was reported to affect future progression rate. Concerning exudative
    complications, the predictive value of SRF has been controversially discussed,56,57 while
    the extent of central retinal thickening and IRF and is thought to represent the
    neovascular activity and therefore visual outcome.58–60 Therefore, it might be
    hypothesized that some of the additionally presented imaging features could also be
    predictive either for neovascular or dry AMD progression. However, the image feature
    description in this study was based on retrospective cross-sectional data, as it was
    beyond the scope of this study to evaluate the accuracy of predictive factors. However,
    the uniformity of the detection, size and location of most imaging features have the
    potential to provide the framework for further prospective studies. These prospective
    studies would allow to further evaluate the predictive value, which might give more
    insights into the pathophysiology of AMD and allow for effective study design as
    presented before for different parameters in AMD or other retinopathies. 38,49,50,52,61,62

    A further limitation of this study is the application of OCT imaging devices by a single
    manufacturer. Different OCT imaging devices might provide different scanning artefacts
    or image quality.63,64 Thereby the annotation and, hence, the reliability of single features
    might be different on large-scale real-world data.65 As there is no gold standard, it
    cannot be excluded that features have been missed and other data sets could provide
    addition conclusions. To minimize this possibility, we relied on trained retinal specialists
    that have identified and interpreted the features and the opportunity to add additional
    features was given at all timepoints during annotation (Supplementary Figure S1).
    In conclusion, this study evaluated the reliability of annotations of multiple OCT features
    representing different disease stages in a reading-center setup. The inclusion of
    objective and reliable features like SRF, IRF, HT, OPL-descent or PED into future
    studies might enable multiple surrogate markers representing different disease stages
    within a single image. This might open up numerous new opportunities for evaluating
    disease progression and possible treatment effect in AMD, possibly leading to a more
    time- and cost-effective interpretation, further insights into the pathomechanisms, and
    improved individualized patient assessment.

    FIGURE LEGENDS
    Figure 1: Optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based feature annotation.
    An OCT B-scan (left) and the respective feature annotation of each reader (right) is
    demonstrated as example. Intraretinal fluid (IRF, blue), subretinal fluid (SRF, orange),
    and pigment epithelial detachment (PED, green) revealed high inter-reader agreement,
    while annotations of loss of ellipsoid zone (EZ-loss, red) and hyperreflective dots (HRD,
    yellow) significantly differed in size and number between the readers. However, the
    location of annotated features within the B-scan was quite similar throughout all
    features.
                                                                                                                                     31

    Figure 2: Inter-reader agreement.
    The Bland-Altman plots demonstrate the inter-reader agreement between two
    exemplary readers (Reader 1 and 4) for measures of drusen, loss of ellipsoid loss (EZ-
    loss), hyperreflective dots (HRD), hypertransmission of OCT-signal (HT), intraretinal
    fluid (IRF), descent of outer plexiform layer (OPL-descent), pigment epithelial
    detachment (PED), loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE-loss), subretinal fluid (SRF),
    and subretinal hyperreflective material (SRHM). The measurement differences (diff.) are
    plotted against their mean. The solid line indicates the mean difference and the dashed
    lines indicate the 95% limits of agreement. There were no systematic differences
    between the readers. Bland-Altman plots for the inter-reader agreement between each
    pair of all readers can be found in the Supplementary Figures S2 - S11.

    Supplementary Figure S1: Annotation tool
    The custom-build platform for annotations is demonstrated. The annotations were made
    in the highlighted optical coherence tomography (OCT) B-scan (middle) by choosing the
    respective label (right). Additional labels not covered by the default setup could be
    added under “Other…”. According to the label, the features were either annotated as
    area, stroke (i.e., line or point), or D-polygon. Wrong annotations could be deleted by
    selecting “Erasing” in the top-right corner. Ungradable B-scans or those without
    abnormalities could be labeled using the boxes at the top. On the top left the infrared
    reflectance image showed the location of the respective B-scan as green line next to a
    small preview of the B-scan. During the annotations, the reader could scroll through the
    other scans of the eye for context. The according color fundus photography was
    visualized at the bottom left.

    Supplementary Figure S11: Inter-reader agreement for the measures of the area
    of subretinal hyperreflective material (SRHM)
    The Bland-Altman plots demonstrate the measurement differences (diff.) of two readers
    plotted against their mean. The solid line indicates the mean difference and the dashed
    lines indicate the 95% limits of agreement. There were no systematic differences
    between the readers.
