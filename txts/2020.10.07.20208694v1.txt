15     Abstract
16     Background. Wolfram syndrome is a rare endoplasmic reticulum disorder characterized by insulin-dependent
17     diabetes mellitus, optic nerve atrophy, and progressive neurodegeneration. Although there is currently no treatment
18     to delay, halt, or reverse the progression of Wolfram syndrome, preclinical studies in cell and rodent models suggest
19     that therapeutic strategies targeting endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis, including dantrolene sodium, may
20     be beneficial.
21     Methods: Based on the results from preclinical studies on dantrolene sodium and ongoing longitudinal studies, our
22     group put together the first-ever clinical trial in pediatric and adult patients with Wolfram syndrome. An open-label
23     phase 1b/2a trial design was chosen. The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of
24     dantrolene sodium in adult and pediatric patients with Wolfram syndrome. Secondary objectives were to evaluate
25     the efficacy of dantrolene sodium on residual pancreatic β-cell functions, visual acuity, quality of life measures
26     related to vision, and neurological functions.
27     Results: The results indicate that dantrolene sodium is well tolerated by patients with Wolfram syndrome. Although
28     the study was small, a select few patients seemed to have improvements in β-cell function, which might correlate
29     with a positive trend in other outcome measures, including visual acuity and neurological functions.
30     Conclusion. This study justifies further investigation into using dantrolene sodium and other small molecules
31     targeting the endoplasmic reticulum for the treatment of Wolfram syndrome.
                                                                            1

51     Key Points
52     Question: Is dantrolene sodium safe and effective for the treatment of adult and pediatric
53     patients with Wolfram syndrome?
54     Findings: The results of this open-label clinical trial show that dantrolene sodium is well
55     tolerated by patients with Wolfram syndrome. Although the study was small, a select few
56     patients seemed to have improvements in β-cell function, which might correlate with a positive
57     trend in other outcome measures, including visual acuity and neurological functions.
58     Meaning: Dantrolene sodium is well tolerated by patients with Wolfram syndrome. Some
59     patients may experience an increase in β cell function when taking dantrolene.

 91     Introduction
 92     Wolfram syndrome is an ultra-rare, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
                                                                                                                  1,2
 93     juvenile-onset insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus and optic nerve atrophy                                    . Other clinical
 94     manifestations of Wolfram syndrome include diabetes insipidus, deafness, neurogenic bladder,
 95     and ataxia. Most individuals with Wolfram syndrome have a shortened lifespan due to severe
 96     neurological disabilities caused by brain stem and cerebellar atrophy 3. There has yet to be a
 97     treatment devised which has been shown to provide a cure or slow the insidious progression of
 98     this disease. As a result, patients with Wolfram syndrome are currently only offered therapies
 99     aimed at treated each aspect of the disease individually.
100
101     Since the discovery of WFS1 as the causative locus for most cases of Wolfram syndrome,
102     research efforts have sought to understand the underlying etiology of this disorder. Our current
103     understanding is that Wolfram syndrome is a prototype of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) disease in
104     humans 4. WFS1 is a multi-pass ER transmembrane protein with an established role in the
                                                                                                                              5,6
105     negative regulation of ER stress and the maintenance of cellular calcium homeostasis                                      . While
106     the molecular details of WFS1 function require further study, it is clear that pancreatic β-cells
107     and neurons are particularly affected by, and perhaps especially sensitive to, disease-causing
108     WFS1 genetic variants. Indeed, previous reports from our lab identified calcium dyshomeostasis
109     as a key mechanism underlying pancreatic β-cell and neuronal cell death in the context of WFS1
                       7-9
110     depletion          . These pre-clinical studies led to identify dantrolene sodium as a potential
111     therapeutic candidate for restoring ER calcium homeostasis and mitigating the progression of
112     Wolfram syndrome.

114     Dantrolene sodium is a hydantoin derivative skeletal muscle relaxant whose mechanism of action
                                                                                                                10-12
115     revolves around the inhibition of ryanodine receptors (RyR) on the ER                                         . Although the
116     mechanism of action of dantrolene remains unclear, its effects are well-documented. Dantrolene
117     inhibits ER calcium efflux through RyR, thereby reducing cytosolic calcium and preserving ER
118     calcium 13. The primary indication for dantrolene is in the treatment of malignant hyperthermia,
119     which can be an adverse reaction to general anesthesia and is FDA approved for use in both
120     adults and children. Dantrolene has also been used off-label for the treatments of spasticity
121     disorders and cerebral vasospasm 14,15. Interestingly, recent studies have proposed a potential role
122     for dantrolene sodium as a treatment for neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington’s
123     disease 16, spinocerebellar ataxia 17,18, and Alzheimer’s disease 19,20, where ER calcium may play
124     a pivotal role in disease pathogenesis.
125
126     Murine and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of Wolfram syndrome were treated with
127     dantrolene sodium to determine the feasibility of a clinical trial8. After receiving promising
128     results from these pre-clinical studies, our group put together the first ever clinical trial in
129     subjects with Wolfram syndrome. Our research team was particularly sensitive to the unique
                                                                                                                              21
130     challenges of performing a clinical trial for a disease as rare as Wolfram syndrome                                      . These
131     challenges include the small numbers of subjects available to study and the vast heterogeneity of
132     symptoms exhibited by patients with Wolfram syndrome 22. Multiple stakeholders were involved
133     in the design of this clinical trial including I-TRAK (a natural history study of neurodegeneration
134     in early Wolfram syndrome, NCT03951298) and various Wolfram syndrome patient/parent
135     advocacy groups as they would be likely sources for recruitment. After these collaborations, an
136     open-label phase 1b/2a trial design was chosen. The primary endpoint of the study was to assess
                                                                            7

140     Results
141     Trial population
142     A total of 22 subjects (6–32 years old) with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of Wolfram
143     syndrome, were screened for enrollment in this study (Figure 1B). Of this group, 21 qualified for
144     baseline laboratory and quality of life assessments in order to begin the run-in regimen of oral
145     dantrolene parallel to ongoing maintenance medications. Two subjects (11% of qualified
146     population) had to be excluded before the 6-month assessment of study outcome measures on
147     dantrolene treatment due to loss to follow-up or personal reasons. The baseline demographic and
148     clinical characteristics of the 19 subjects that completed the trial are shown in Table 1. Subject-
149     specific WFS1 mutations and clinical data are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. At
150     enrollment 100% of subjects carried a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. However, only 63% of
151     pediatric subjects and 100% of adult subjects carried a diagnosis of optic atrophy. This pattern is
152     consistent with the documented natural history of Wolfram syndrome, where juvenile-onset
153     diabetes mellitus typically manifests within the first decade, followed by optic atrophy in the
154     second decade of life 3,23,24.
155
156     Safety outcomes
157     Dantrolene was well-tolerated among pediatric subjects at a final daily dose between 0.5 mg/kg
158     and 2.0 mg/kg, with a maximun daily dose of 100 mg. The mean final daily dose in the pediatric
159     subjects was 1.25 mg/kg/day (Figure 1C). Adults subjects tolerated dantrolene well between 50
160     mg to 100 mg daily. 5, 4, and 2 subjects tolerated 50, 75, and 100 mg of dantrolene respectively.
161     This resulted in a mean dose of 68.2 mg daily (Figure 1D). These dosing ranges closely
162     approximated therapeutic ranges for dantrolene when used to treat spasticity 25.
                                                                            9

164     Adverse events were stratified into three categories based on their likelihood of being attributed
165     to the study drug. These categories included adverse events attributed directly to dantrolene,
166     events known to occur commonly in patients with Wolfram syndrome, and non-specific events
167     not easily attributed to dantrolene or Wolfram syndrome. The most common adverse dantrolene
168     related events observed in pediatric and adult subjects were mild fatigue and diarrhea. The most
169     common Wolfram syndrome related events were mild hypoglycemia, and headaches. These
170     symptoms affected at least 25% of the total study population (Table 2). Hepatoxicity and
171     weakness, the most serious known side effects of dantrolene, were not very prevalent in our
172     study population. Elevated liver enzymes were observed in 2 subjects (11% of total population)
173     and weakness was self-reported by 4 subjects (21% of total population). Quantitative
174     assessments of strength prior to and at each subsequent trial visit after dantrolene administration
175     showed no significant loss in grip strength during 6-months of dantrolene treatment
176     (Supplementary Figure 1). No clinically significant changes in laboratory measures or in findings
177     from physical examinations were noted during enrollment in this study. No significant EKG
178     changes were observed in subjects during the run-in period or thereafter. Additionally, no subject
179     discontinued the trial regimen due to adverse effects.
180
181     Secondary outcomes
182     -Markers of β-cell function
183     To assess the effect of dantrolene on glycemia and remaining β-cell function, HbA1c and 30-
184     minute mixed-meal stimulated C-peptide were monitored at baseline and after 6-months of
185     dantrolene treatment (Figure 1A). Mean HbA1c across all subjects remained stable between
                                                                           10

186     dantrolene initiation and after 6-months of treatment (7.4 ± 0.2 %, p-value 0.63). Subgroup
187     analyses of adult and pediatric subjects also demonstrated no significant change in HbA1c (7.4
188     ± 0.2 %) (Figure 2A). Mean fasting C-peptide levels of the total study cohort also remained
189     stable during this period (0.27 ± 0.07 ng/mL at 6-months of treatment compared to 0.27 ± 0.06
190     ng/mL at baseline, p-value 0.95). At the conclusion of the study, mean stimulated C-peptide
191     levels were not significantly higher compared to the pre-treatment baseline (0.64 ± 0.14 ng/mL
192     after 6-months of treatment compared to 0.52 ± 0.10 ng/mL at baseline, p-value 0.14) (Figure
193     2B). Supplementary Figure 2 demonstrates subject specific change in fasting and stimulated C-
194     peptide over the 6-month study period. When looking at all subjects, ∆C-peptide (the change in
195     C-peptide between 0 and 30 minutes) was not significantly increased. Mean ∆C-peptide was 0.37
196     ± 0.07 ng/mL after 6-months of treatment, compared to 0.25 ± 0.04 ng/mL at baseline (p-value
197     0.18) (Figure 3A and Supplementary Table S2).

199     Additional markers of β-cell function were performed including measuring proinsulin along with

202     differences were found in any of these categories (Supplementary Table S2).

204     -Subgroup analyses
205     Additional subgroup analysis was performed in the study population to determine if there was
206     subset of subjects who had the most beneficial response to dantrolene. Our hypothesis was that
207     subjects who possessed the greatest degree of β cell function at baseline, would have the greatest
208     glycemic benefit from dantrolene. Therefore, we examined the change in ∆C-peptide (∆∆C-
                                                                           11

209     peptide) over the course of the study to approximate changes in β cell responsiveness. ∆∆C-
210     peptide was calculated by subtracting the ∆C-peptide at baseline from the ∆C-peptide at 6-
211     months. In order to test our hypothesis, we divided the subjects based on increasing cutoffs of
212     ∆∆C-peptide (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 ng/mL). We noted that 8 subjects had a ∆∆C-peptide ≥ 0.05
213     ng/mL, 5 subjects had a ∆∆C-peptide ≥ 0.1 ng/mL, and 4 subjects had a ∆∆C-peptide ≥ 0.2
214     ng/mL. The remaining 6 subjects had a ∆∆C-peptide <0.05 ng/mL or were missing data
215     necessary for calculation of ∆∆C-peptide (Figure 3A). Review of these data suggested that our
216     hypothesis was correct, as subjects with higher ∆C-peptide to begin with, tended to have a higher
217     ∆C-peptide at 6 months and higher slope (∆∆C-peptide). To further test this relationship, we
218     performed linear regression analysis demonstrating a statistically significant (R2 0.439, p-value
219     0.004) positive relationship between baseline ∆C-peptide, and (∆∆C-peptide) (Figure 3B). A
220     histogram was created to visualize the distribution of ∆∆C-peptide amongst the study subjects
221     (Figure 3C). The 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 ng/mL cutoffs were superimposed upon this the linear
                                                                                          28,29
222     regression and histograms. Based on previous literature                                 , we decided that the cutoff of a
223     ∆∆C-peptide ≥ 0.1 ng/mL is likely to be of clinical significance, for subjects with Wolfram
224     syndrome. This fit the overall distribution of data, as 5 subjects (subject ID #4, 8, 10, 17, and
225     22), met this criterion. They represented 26.3% of the total study population. These subjects
226     included 3 adult and 2 pediatric individuals. The ∆∆C-peptide ≥ 0.1 ng/mL cutoff is henceforth
227     used to classify subjects as responders versus non-responders.
228
229     As our hypothesis is that subjects with increased β cell function had a more robust response to
230     dantrolene, we set out to determine if any baseline measurement had predictive value. This could
231     help clinicians, caring for patients with Wolfram, determine if dantrolene could be beneficial.

232     Therefore basal, stimulated, and ∆C-peptide data collected from subjects prior to starting
233     dantrolene were analyzed to determine which of these criteria could best be used. Histograms
234     and receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) curves were created based on these data. A positive
235     control using ∆∆C-peptide which, by design, demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity
236     using a ∆∆C-peptide value ≥ 0.12 ng/mL was also created (Supplementary Figure 3D,H).
237     Baseline measurements of β-cell function had a modest predictive value. Unstimulated (Basal)
238     C-peptide had the highest area under the curve (AUC), demonstrating a peak of 60% sensitivity,
239     and 100% specificity when using a cutoff of 0.38 ng/mL. Similarly, stimulated C-peptide
240     demonstrated 60% sensitivity and 100% specificity when using a cutoff of 0.725 ng/mL. ∆C-
241     peptide had the lowest AUC, demonstrating 40% sensitivity and 100% specificity when using a
242     cutoff of 0.44 ng/mL (Supplementary Figure 3A-C, E-G; Supplementary Table S3)
243
244     There were no significant differences between responders and non-responders in terms of HbA1c
245     at the beginning (7.1 ± 0.2 % and 7.5 ± 0.2 % respectively, p-value 0.49) of the study and after 6-
246     months of treatment (7.1 ± 0.3 % and 7.6 ± 0.3 % respectively, p-value 0.42). Prior to treatment
247     with dantrolene, responder subjects had higher fasting C-peptide compared to non-responders
248     (0.47 ± 0.17 ng/dL compared to 0.18 ± 0.03 ng/dL, p-value 0.03). By design, responder subjects
249     demonstrated statistically significant increases in fasting C-peptide (0.53 ± 0.17 ng/dL to 0.15 ±
250     0.006 ng/dL), stimulated C-peptide (1.20 ± 0.33 ng/dL to 0.38 ± 0.05 ng/dL p-value 0.003), and
251     ∆C-peptide (0.67 ± 0.17 ng/dL to 0.23 ± 0.02 ng/dL p-value 0.002) after the 6-month treatment
252     period. Similar patterns were seen in between responders and non-responders when measuring
253     proinsulin, insulinogenic index, and AUC C-peptide / AUC Glucose. C-peptide to glucose ratio

254     seemed to be elevated in the pediatric and responder groups compared to adults and non-
255     responders respectively (Supplementary Figure 4, Supplementary Table S4).
256
257     -Markers of visual acuity
258     To evaluate the effect of dantrolene treatment on visual acuity and vision-related quality of life,
259     participants underwent ophthalmologic examination at screening, and at baseline, and after 6
260     months of dantrolene treatment. No significant changes in visual acuity were observed across
261     subjects or age groups as a function of dantrolene treatment (Figure 2C, Supplementary Table
262     S2). Of note, subject 12 had a LogMAR = 3 throughout the study period, which equates to
263     functional blindness. As a result, subject 12’s data was excluded from analysis. Supplementary
264     Figure 5 demonstrates the LogMAR data including subject 12. Subgroup analyses did not
265     identify any significant differences between adult and pediatric subjects or subjects deemed to be
266     non-responders or responders. Correspondingly, subjects reported no significant improvements
267     in vision-related quality of life as measured by the NEIVFQ-25 (Supplementary Table S5).
268
269     Linear regression analysis was performed comparing ΔΔ C-peptide to LogMAR. This resulted in
270     a slight, but statistically significant negative correlation (R2 0.136, p-value 0.023)
271     (Supplementary Figure 6A).
272
273     -Disease severity and quality of life
274     Overall disease severity was assessed in subjects prior to, and 6-months after starting dantrolene
275     treatment via WURS assessment 30. There were no differences in total WURS disease severity,
276     or mean physician rated physical exam scores across the 6 months of the study. Subgroup
                                                                           14

277     analysis noted that pediatric subjects demonstrated statistically insignificant lower physician
278     rated WURS (3.1 ± 1.3 at baseline and 3.1 ± 1.2 after 6-months) (p-value 1.00) than adult
279     subjects (7.6 ± 1.8 at baseline and 8.8 ± 2.7 after 6-months) (p-value 0.71) (p-value 0.09 and 0.11
280     at baseline and 6-months respectively when comparing pediatric to adult subjects). Subjects
281     deemed to be responders also demonstrated statistically insignificant lower physician rated
282     WURS scores when comparing baseline (4.2 ± 1.6) and 6-months (3.2 ± 1.2) (p-value 0.62).
283     Non-responders saw a statistically insignificant increase in physician rated WURS scores when
284     comparing baseline (6.3 ± 1.6) to 6-months of treatment (7.5 ± 2.3) (p-value 0.67) (p-value 0.48
285     and 0.28 at baseline and 6-months respectively when comparing non-responder to responder
286     subjects) (Figure 2, and Supplementary Tables S2 and S4). Similarly, pediatric subjects
287     displayed no significant changes in physical or psychosocial health domains as measured by the
288     PedsQL questionnaire between screening and 6 months of dantrolene therapy (Supplementary
289     Table S6) and adult subjects did not show differences in physical or mental health metrics when
290     assessed by the SF-36v (Supplementary Table S7).
291
292     Similar to the LogMAR data, linear regression analysis was performed correlating ΔΔ C-peptide
293     to Total WURS and physician rated WURS. These regression plots appeared to demonstrate a
294     negative correlation, but did not reach statistical significance (R2 0.085, p-value 0.117 and R2
295     0.021, p-value 0.444 for total WURS and physician rated WURS respectively) (Supplementary
296     Figure 6 B-C).

298     Discussion
299     In this study, we evaluate the safety and tolerability of dantrolene sodium as a therapeutic
300     approach for Wolfram syndrome. Our preclinical studies show that dantrolene improves β-cell
301     and neuronal cell survival in mouse and patient iPSC models of this disease8. To translate these
302     findings to humans, we conducted the first clinical trial in pediatric and adult subjects with
303     Wolfram syndrome in a 6-month study of dantrolene sodium (NCT02829268). We identified a
304     tolerable range of oral dantrolene dosing of 0.5mg/kg/day to 2mg/kg/day for pediatric subjects
305     and 50mg/day to 100mg/day for adults. Overall, dantrolene was very well tolerated, and aside
306     from mild fatigue and diarrhea, no clinically significant adverse events were reported.
307
308     Admittedly, this proof of concept study ran into many of the same issues that plague early
309     clinical trials for rare diseases 21. As the incidence of Wolfram syndrome is so rare, it is difficult
310     to recruit a large enough sample size in order to detect a statistically significant difference in
311     secondary measures of β-cell function, visual acuity, or quality of life. In order to aid with
312     recruitment, our study team collaborated with existing natural history studies and patient/parent
313     organizations. Particularly, patient/parent organizations expressed a strong desire for a potential
314     therapeutic option, as there are currently no approved treatments aimed at slowing the
315     progression of Wolfram syndrome. Through the design of the study, potential study subjects
316     lobbied strongly against a blinded or placebo-controlled study design. This helped inform our
317     decision toward an open-label phase 1b/2a design, as a positive outcome would clear a path for
318     more widespread adoption of a drug aimed at slowing the progression of Wolfram syndrome that
319     is at least proven to be safe, if not necessarily effective in all individuals. The final challenge
320     facing this study is the vast clinical heterogeneity seen in the spectrum of individuals with
                                                                           16

321     Wolfram syndrome                  . Independent of age, some individuals are more severely affected or
322     progress more rapidly than others. Our hypothesis is that these differences may be based on the
323     severity of the WFS1 gene variants. For example, individuals with missense mutations, may have
324     a less severe course compared to large deletions or non-sense mutations. This clinically and
325     genetically heterogeneous population makes it more challenging to infer cause and effect
326     relationships when studying a potential drug. As a result, our strategy has been to target the
327     underlying cellular defect (ER calcium depletion) that is unified amongst all patients with
328     Wolfram syndrome 32.
329
330     With the above challenges in mind, there remain many shortcomings of this study. As it is an
331     uncontrolled study, certain parameters measured are susceptible to confounding by the placebo
332     effect. Due to the small sample sizes there were no statistically significant differences in β-cell
333     function or disease severity. For these reasons, this study does not posit that dantrolene improves
334     β-cell function or disease severity. Instead, it identifies safe doses for treatment of adult and
335     pediatric subjects with Wolfram syndrome, highlights the side effect profile of dantrolene in this
336     population and argues that further investigation of dantrolene, or investigational agents with a
337     similar mechanism of action, are warranted in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
338     study. With this caveat in mind, this study also suggests that dantrolene requires further
339     investigation in the context of β-cell function and neurodegeneration.
340
341     Perhaps the most salient question arising from this study is whether dantrolene improves human
342     β-cell function in Wolfram syndrome. Mean stimulated C-peptide was not significantly different
343     when looking at all subjects. However, parsing subjects by age reveals that pediatric subjects had
                                                                           17

344     a statistically insignificant increase in C-peptide. Subgroup analyses, suggests that subjects with
345     better baseline β-cell function (earlier on in the progression of the disease and β-cell loss) may
346     have the most benefit from dantrolene sodium (Figure 3B). Interestingly, linear regression
347     analysis also demonstrated that subjects with the greatest increase in β-cell function tended to
348     have improved visual acuity and less severe disease (Supplementary Figure 6A). These data
349     suggest that the greatest beneficiaries of dantrolene treatment may be newly diagnosed pediatric
350     subjects who retain a significant degree of β-cell function. The ROC analysis (Supplementary
351     Figure 3) suggests that having a fasting C-peptide > 0.38 ng/mL, can help predict if a subject will
352     have an greater than 0.1 ng/mL increase Δ C-peptide over 6 months of dantrolene treatment.
353     While a controlled human study is required to assess dantrolene’s efficacy at improving β-cell
354     function, pediatric subjects in our study started to exhibit a trend towards higher stimulated C-
355     peptide levels after 6-months of sustained dantrolene treatment. Adult subjects, in contrast, show
356     a negligible increase in mean stimulated C-peptide levels throughout their duration of dantrolene
357     treatment. These data suggest that dantrolene may be more effective in pediatric subjects,
358     possibly because these subjects have a larger surviving subpopulation of functional β-cells
359     during this initial phase of their disease process. Evidently, adult subjects also secrete very low
360     levels of insulin, but dantrolene did not seem to significantly enhance β-cell function in this
361     group.
362
363     The significance of these small elevations in C-peptide is quite interesting when comparing
364     Wolfram syndrome to type 1 diabetes. Recently, there has been a growing body of literature
365     suggesting that there is clinical benefit from a very small degree of residual β-cell function.
366     Oram and colleagues published a population-based study in the United Kingdom, demonstrating
                                                                           18

367     that 8% of subjects had a urinary C-peptide-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 0.2 nmol/mmol 29. This study
368     and another follow-up study in 2019 demonstrated that this persistent micro-secretion of C-
369     peptide is associated with fewer complications of diabetes and less hypoglycemia 28. Contrasting
370     these populations, subjects with Wolfram syndrome tend to have much higher C-peptide
371     compared to type 1 diabetes. Notably the preserved C-peptide group in the 2019 study had a
372     mean stimulated C-peptide of 114 pmol/L (0.3443 ng/mL). This is compared to a mean
373     stimulated C-peptide of 0.52 ng/mL (205 pmol/L) in our study population with Wolfram
374     syndrome. These data suggest that small, statistically insignificant, increases in C-peptide may
375     be clinically significant. Anecdotally, some of the study investigators noticed that the subject’s
376     insulin needs decreased during the study, but this was not systematically evaluated in this study.
377     Additionally, many subjects wearing a continuous glucose monitors noticed more stable
378     glycemic patterns. As a result, we suggest that future studies of dantrolene or similar agents track
379     changes in total daily insulin dose (with percentage basal versus bolus) and analyze continuous
380     glucose monitor tracings (i.e. time-in-range, time-in-hypoglycemia, and standard deviation).
381
382     Similar to β-cell function, over 6 months of treatment with dantrolene sodium there were no
383     significant differences in markers of visual acuity. Markers of disease severity including WURS
384     score and other pediatric and adult quality of life measures did not significantly change over 6
385     months of treatment with dantrolene sodium. However, we noted that pediatric subjects tended to
386     have lower physician rated WURS scores compared to their adult counterparts.

388     We postulate that efficacy of dantrolene may be linked to the nature of the WFS1 mutations in
389     the individual subjects. Over time, and with further experience with dantrolene, perhaps
390     dantrolene can be part of a personalized medicine approach for patients with Wolfram syndrome.
391
392     In summary, this study suggests that dantrolene sodium is safely tolerated by subjects with
393     Wolfram syndrome. Although the study was small, a select few subjects seemed to have
394     improvements in β-cell function. Therefore, this study justifies further investigation into using
395     dantrolene sodium and other ER-calcium stabilizers for the treatment of Wolfram syndrome.

417
418     Study protocol
419     Dantrolene sodium was dispensed to the study subjects via the Washington University’s clinical
420     trials pharmacy. Subjects were instructed to take the dantrolene by mouth. Subjects enrolled in
                                                                           21

421     this study underwent a run-in period for dose maximization (Figure 1A). Adult subjects were
422     started on up to 25 mg dantrolene daily for seven days, then doubled in dose on a weekly basis
423     up to a maximum of 200mg dantrolene daily. Pediatric subjects (< 18-years old) were started on
424     up to 0.5 mg/kg dantrolene daily (maximum 25 mg) for seven days, then doubled in dose on a
425     weekly basis up to a maximum of 2mg/kg dantrolene daily (maximum 200 mg), with no dose
426     change if weight fell within ± 3% of the original dosing weight. Dosing calendars were
427     maintained by the study subjects to ensure adherence to the study drug.
428
429     Safety assessment and outcomes measures
430     Baseline screening procedures included complete physical exam, standard clinical laboratory
431     tests (serum chemistry, liver function tests, hematology, and urinalysis), and 12-lead ECG.
432     Subjects underwent formal visual acuity testing by the co-authors of the study who are either
433     optometrists or ophthalmologists. At baseline, each subject underwent the Wolfram Unified
                                           30
434     Rating Scale (WURS)                   . The 30-minute mixed meal tolerance test was performed to assess
435     base-line β cell functions as described before 24. The mixed meal consisted of 6 ml/kg (maximum
436     360 ml) of Boost® (Nestle) consumed over a maximum of 5 minutes. After the overnight
437     fasting, blood for glucose and C-peptide measurement was drawn at time 0 (fasting) and 30
438     minutes after the Boost. If a subject’s fasting glucose exceeded 250 mg/dL, the test was not
439     performed, but fasting glucose and C-peptide were obtained. An ECG was performed before and
440     4-hours after the first dose of dantrolene was administered during the run-in period, then again at
441     2-months and 6-months. Best-corrected visual acuity was assessed by Snellen optotype and
                                                      33
442     converted to LogMar score                        . Vision-related quality of life was assessed in all subjects at
443     screening and after 6 months of dantrolene by the National Eye Institute’s 25-item Visual
                                                                            22

448     safety concerns were identified at screening, subjects began the 3-week dose maximization
449     period of dantrolene sodium. All baseline screening procedures were repeated again at 6-months
450     of treatment to ensure subject safety and assess dantrolene tolerability. Grip strength was
451     measured at each visit bilaterally using a digital hand dynamometer (CAMRY). A final safety
452     follow-up visit was conducted at 28 days (+/- 7 days) after the last outcome measure evaluation
453     in order to collect additional information on adverse events, concomitant medications, therapies
454     and procedures. For subjects who discontinued the study prior to the first outcomes measures
455     evaluation, safety follow-up visit was conducted within 28 days (+/- 7 days) after the last
456     administration of dantrolene sodium.
457
458     Statistics
459     Secondary outcome measures (HbA1c, Glucose, C-peptide, Proinsulin, Insulinogenic Index,
460     AUC C-peptide/ AUC Glucose, LogMAR, and WURS) were reported with the mean result ± the
461     standard error of the mean (SEM). T-tests were performed on these secondary outcome measures
462     when comparing the same group using scipy (https://www.scipy.org) and pandas
463     (https://pandas.pydata.org/index.html) programming libraries. Paired t-tests were used when
464     comparing the same group (all-subjects, adults, pediatrics, non-responders, responders) at 0 and
465     6 months. Linear regression analyses (including R2 and p-values) were constructed using the
466     ordinary                least               squares             method              using            the           statsmodels
