                                             Background: Draconic control measures were introduced to contain the global
                                             COVID-19 pandemic, many of which have been controversial, particularly the
                                             comprehensive use of diagnostic tests. Regular testing of high-risk individuals
                                             (pre-existing conditions, older than 60 years of age) has been suggested by public health
                                             authorities. The WHO suggested the use of routine screening of residents, employees,
                                             and visitors of long-term care facilities (LTCF) to protect the resident risk group.
                                             Similar suggestions have been made by the WHO for other closed facilities including
                                             incarceration facilities (e.g., prisons or jails), where in parts of the US, accelerated
                                             release of approved inmates is taken as a measure to mitigate COVID-19.
                                             Methods and findings: Here, the simulation model underlying the pandemic
                                             preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) is extended to investigate the
                                             effect of regularly testing of employees in order to protect immobile resident risk groups
                                             in closed facilities. The reduction in the number of infections and deaths within the risk
                                             group are investigated as well as the potential economic gain resulting from savings in
                                             COVID-19 related treatment costs in comparison to costs resulting from the testing
                                             interventions. Our simulations are adjusted to reflect the situation of LTCFs in the
                                             Federal Republic of Germany.
                                                 The probability is nearly one that COVID-19 spreads into closed facilities due to
                                             contact with infected employees even under strict confinement of visitors in a pandemic
                                             scenario without targeted protective measures. Regular screening of all employees by
                                             PCR tests provides a significant reduction of COVID-19 cases and related deaths in
                                             LTCFs. While the frequency of testing (testing rate) and the quality of tests have
                                             noticeable effects, the waiting time for obtaining test results (ranging from 12 up to 96
                                             hours) hardly impacts the outcome. The results suggest that testing every two weeks
                                             with low-quality tests and a processing time of up to 96 hours yields a strong reduction
                                             in the number of cases. Rough estimates suggest a significant economic gain.
                                             Conclusions: The introduction of COVID-19 in closed facilities is unavoidable without
                                             thorough screening of persons that can introduce the disease into the facility. These

                                             measures provide an economically meaningful way to protect vulnerable risk groups
                                             characterized by an elevated risk of severe infections in closed facilities, in which
                                             contact-reducing measures are difficult to implement due to imminent unavoidable close

                                             or dead individuals. Infected individuals pass through I. a latency period (not yet                     80

                                               derived from the results described above. Such considerations must incorporate testing                  238

                                               intervention with weekly testing (48 times per year and employee) amounts to 960                        244

                                                 The results clearly indicate that regular COVID-19-screening of LTCF employees by                   277
                                             testing successfully reduces the number of cases and deaths in the resident risk group.                 278
                                             Even with relative conservative assumptions a 10-fold reduction is achieved. Our results                279
                                             indicate that the frequency at which employees are tested has a strong effect. Testing                  280

                                             Moreover, serological tests will have a lower sensitivity in the early stages of the                    300

                                             per test. Hence, the economic gain would be further amplified due to the cost efficiency.               307
                                                 The proposed intervention considers regular testing only of LTCFs employees (staff)                 308

                                                 It should be noted that general contact reducing measures are modelled in a rather                  313
