   ABSTRACT
   OBJECTIVE
   To continually evaluate the rapidly evolving evidence base on the role of cardiovascular drugs in
   COVID-19 clinical outcomes (susceptibility to infection, hospitalization, hospitalization length, disease
   severity, and all-cause mortality).
   DESIGN
   Living systematic review and meta-analysis.
   DATA SOURCES
   Eligible publications identified from >500 databases indexed through 31st July 2020 and additional
   studies from reference lists, with planned continual surveillance for at least two years.
   STUDY SELECTION
   Observational and interventional studies that report on the association between cardiovascular drugs
   and COVID-19 clinical outcomes.
   DATA EXTRACTION
   Single-reviewer extraction and quality evaluation (using ROBINS-I), with half the records
   independently extracted and evaluated by a second reviewer.
   RESULTS
   Of 23,427 titles screened, 175 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. The most reported
   drug classes were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers
   (ARBs) with ACEI/ARB exposure being associated with higher odds of testing positive for COVID-19
   (pooled unadjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.30). Among patients with COVID-19, unadjusted
   estimates showed that ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with being hospitalized (OR 2.25, 1.70 to
   2.98) and having severe disease (OR 1.50, 1.27 to 1.77) but not with the length of hospitalization (mean
                                                                  2

   difference -0.45, -1.33 to 0.43 days) or all-cause mortality (OR 1.25, CI 0.98 to 1.58). However, after
   adjustment, ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with testing positive for COVID-19 (pooled
   adjusted OR 1.01, 0.93 to 1.10), being hospitalized (OR 1.16, 0.80 to 1.68), having severe disease (1.04,
   0.76 to 1.42), or all-cause mortality (0.86, 0.64 to 1.15). Similarly, subgroup analyses involving only
   hypertensive patients revealed that ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with being hospitalized
   (OR 0.84, 0.58 to 1.22), disease severity (OR 0.88, 0.68 to 1.14) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.77, 0.54 to
   1.12) while it decreased the length of hospitalization (mean difference -0.71, -1.11 to -0.30 days). After
   adjusting for relevant covariates, other cardiovascular drug classes were mostly not found to be
   associated with poor COVID-19 clinical outcomes. However, the validity of these findings is limited by
   a high level of heterogeneity in terms of effect sizes and a serious risk of bias, mainly due to
   confounding in the included studies.
   CONCLUSION
   Our comprehensive review shows that ACEI/ARB exposure is associated with COVID-19 outcomes such
   as susceptibility to infection, severity, and hospitalization in unadjusted analyses. However, after
   adjusting for potential confounding factors, this association is not evident. Patients on cardiovascular
   drugs should continue taking their medications as currently recommended. Higher quality evidence in
   the form of randomized controlled trials will be needed to determine any adverse or beneficial effects
   of cardiovascular drugs.

   BACKGROUND
   Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported on 8 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei
   province, China.1 It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which
   infects cells through the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.2 It was designated
   a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 20203 and has since affected 188 countries,
   more than 31 million patients and led to over 957,000 deaths (as of 20 September 20204). To put it
   into context, cardiovascular diseases such as ischemic heart disease, stroke and heart failure remain
   the leading causes of global deaths, being responsible for an estimated 17·8 million deaths in 2017.5
   The interaction between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease appears complex and bi-directional
   with cardiovascular disease increasing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity and
   at the same time COVID-19 causing injury to the cardiovascular system in some patients.6-9
   Consequently, the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular drugs is of interest because: a)
   patients with increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be taking these drugs, b) they may
   alleviate cardiovascular injury caused by COVID-19, and c) cardiovascular drugs such as angiotensin-
   converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may play a direct role in
   COVID-19 pathology.2
   Recent systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses10-21 have characterized the relationship between
   COVID-19 outcomes (such as severity and mortality) and cardiovascular drugs. These reviews have,
   however, been limited in scope in terms of the COVID-19 outcomes and cardiovascular drugs studied.
   For example, most have focused on ACEIs and ARBs given their interaction with the ACE2 receptor
   that facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells.2 However, being a novel disease, a lot is still unknown
   about COVID-19 which makes a broader systematic review (in terms of the drugs studied) necessary.
   Moreover, there are emerging reports that other drug classes such as anticoagulants, calcium channel
   blockers and statins could be beneficial.22-25 Additionally, many cardiovascular disease patients are on
   combination therapies and a broader review may facilitate understanding of the interplay between
   the different classes of cardiovascular drugs. Lastly, evidence in this field is rapidly evolving which
                                                                  4

   means that recently published reviews soon become outdated. To provide more comprehensive and
   up-to-date evidence, we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate all the
   current evidence on the influence of cardiovascular drugs on COVID-19 clinical outcomes. Due to the
   rapidly evolving nature of this field, we will periodically update this baseline review for up to two years
   to reflect emerging evidence.
   METHODS
   A predefined protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42020191283), based on the principles of the Cochrane
   Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions26 with living systematic review considerations27 28
   was followed. This report adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
   Analyses (PRISMA) statement29 (Table S1).
   Identification of studies
   A final search of the University of Liverpool’s DISCOVER platform (which links, through EBSCOhost, to
   sources from >500 databases including MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus, the Web of Science and
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial libraries) was undertaken on 31st July 2020 using medical
   subject headings and text words related to “cardiovascular drugs” and “COVID-19” (Text S1). A
   separate MEDLINE search (Text S1) was conducted to ensure that the DISCOVER search was retrieving
   all eligible records. Lists of references from the identified studies and previous systematic reviews
   were hand-searched to identify additional eligible articles. Preprint servers (bioRxiv and medRxiv, Text
   S1), COVID-19 specific databases (such as the COVID-19 Clinical Trials registry and the World Health
   Organization database of COVID-19 publications), other registries/results databases (such as
   ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) and grey literature were also
   searched to identify further eligible studies. After this baseline review is published, monthly searches
   will be conducted in the major bibliographic databases using the DISCOVER platform, with quarterly
                                                                  5

   searches applying to the other sources (including additional preprint servers such as Authorea.com,
   Preprints from Lancet, and Preprints.org).
   Selection criteria
   Both observational (e.g. cohorts/case-series and case-control studies) and interventional (e.g.
   randomised controlled trials) studies investigating the association between cardiovascular drugs and
   COVID-19 were included. Cardiovascular drugs were defined as those found in Chapter 2
   (“Cardiovascular system”) of the British National Formulary30 while COVID-19 clinical outcomes
   included those outlined below. Unless translated text could be obtained, non-English studies were
   excluded.
   Outcomes
   COVID-19 clinical outcomes included susceptibility to infection, disease severity (Text S2),
   hospitalization, hospitalization length, and all-cause mortality.
   Data extraction
   Two reviewers (IGA for DISCOVER and SP for MEDLINE) independently screened titles and abstracts of
   the retrieved bibliographic records according to eligibility. Where no abstract was available, the full
   text was obtained unless the article could be confidently excluded by its title alone. Full texts of
   potentially eligible studies were retrieved, a data extraction form developed and piloted in a subset
   of ten randomly selected papers and used to extract relevant information (related to study design,
   patient characteristics, cardiovascular drugs, COVID-19 outcomes, and study quality). Data from all
   eligible studies were extracted (Text S3 for more details) and summarized by one reviewer (IGA). As a
   quality control measure, a second reviewer (SP or RT) independently extracted and evaluated half the
   records to ascertain consistency. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.

   Assessment of study quality
   To assess the quality of each included study estimate, the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for
   randomized trials31 and ROBINS-I (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions) tool for
   non-randomized studies32 were used. When applying ROBINS-I, we bore in mind that our aim was to
   quantify the effect of starting and adhering to the intervention under study on our outcomes, and so
   co-interventions such as other cardiovascular drugs, steroids, antivirals or procedures like mechanical
   ventilation that could differ between intervention groups and so could impact the outcomes were
   considered. Based on several systematic reviews of risk factors for COVID-19 outcomes,8 33-44 the
   confounding domains we thought relevant to all or most studies included age, race, gender,
   cardiovascular comorbidities (including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity), smoking and clinical
   setting/location.
   Data synthesis
   Where ≥ 2 studies reporting on the same exposure-outcome combination were reported, effect
   estimates were pooled by way of random-effects meta-analyses using R version 3.6.145 (R meta
   package46). Odds ratios and mean differences (with 95% confidence intervals) were generated for
   dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. Both unadjusted (or in the case of binary
   outcomes, count data, which is preferred to unadjusted odds ratios as it provides more reliable
   estimates47) and adjusted estimates were extracted and pooled separately. Where there was more
   than one adjusted estimate, the estimate adjusting for the most covariates was preferred. Since
   different studies adjust for different covariates, we did not limit our inclusion criteria to a given set of
   covariates. Where median values and ranges/interquartile ranges were provided (for example for
   length of hospitalization), they were used to estimate the mean values and standard deviations.48
   Where necessary, means and standard deviations were combined using formulae available in the
   Cochrane Handbook.49 Forest plots were prepared for each exposure-outcome combination. Studies
                                                                  7

   that could not be pooled due to being the only ones reporting on an exposure-outcome combination
   were also included as part of qualitative synthesis.
   Heterogeneity measures
   The magnitude of inconsistency in the study results was assessed by visually examining forest plots
   and considering the I2 statistic.26 50 Arbitrarily-defined categories of heterogeneity were: I2 <30 %, low;
   I2 = 30–70 %, moderate; and I2 >70 %, high. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored during
   the subgroup analyses (see below).
   Publication bias
   Where enough (≥10) studies were available for a given exposure-outcome combination, publication
   bias was assessed using the linear regression test of funnel plot asymmetry (Egger’s test, implemented
   using the metabias function in the R meta package46). A p-value <0.1 was considered to suggest the
   presence of publication bias. When asymmetry was suggested by a visual assessment, we performed
   exploratory analyses to investigate and adjust for it (trim and fill analysis) using the trimfill function (R
   metafor package51).
   Sensitivity and subgroup analyses
   Due to the need to provide results in real-time, many COVID-19 studies are being directly uploaded to
   preprint servers and/or undergoing rapid peer review. Therefore, in addition to a robust quality
   assessment, we conducted sensitivity analyses in which prominent/outlier studies were excluded to
   identify those studies whose retraction would significantly alter the pooled estimates. Prominent
   studies were identified through visual examination of the forest plots (criteria including accorded
   weights and whether individual estimates were consistent with other study estimates). Random
   effects meta-regression (Text S4) was conducted to both explore heterogeneity and inform sub-group
   analyses. Where possible, sub-group analyses based on drug sub-classes were also conducted.
                                                                  8

   Confidence in cumulative evidence
   The strength of the body of evidence and the quality and strength of recommendations was assessed
   according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations)
   criteria.52 53
   Review updating
   After each monthly search, new evidence will be briefly summarized unless it changes the nature or
   strength of the conclusions, in which case a major update will be performed. The COVID-19 situation
   is extremely dynamic, and it is not possible to tell when we will be transitioning out of the living
   systematic review mode (updating for up to two years planned). The review scope and methods will,
   however, be reviewed at least once a year.
   RESULTS
   Study selection and characteristics
   Of the 23,427 titles screened, 178 and 175 studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative
   syntheses respectively (Figure 1). The characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table S2.
   Out of the 178 studies, more than a third (n = 67, 38%) were preprints. Most studies (n = 163, 92%)
   had a cohort/case series design with 14 (8%) being case-control studies. Only one (<1%) study was an
   open-label randomized control trial; however, it conducted a retrospective/non-pre-specified interim
   analysis of its currently recruited trial participants. The most commonly reported drug exposure was
   with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (ACEI/ARB),
   which therefore became the main focus.
   The summary risk of bias assessment for ACEI/ARB exposure is shown in Figure S1 (unadjusted
   estimates, all five outcomes). All studies had serious risks of bias, mainly driven by confounding (only
   counts/unadjusted estimates considered, with no adjustment for potential confounders) and
                                                                  9

   inappropriate selection of participants into the study (selection into the study was related to ACEI/ARB
   exposure and severity/hospitalization/mortality outcomes). The risk of bias in classification of
   interventions was generally considered low because of the chronic nature of most drug exposures
   while there was little information to assess the risk of bias due to deviations from intended
   interventions (we aimed to quantify the effect of starting and adhering to the intervention as
   explained under the methods section, although information on adherence was rarely reported).
   Although we did not examine each study’s individual analysis plan, the risk of bias due to missing data
   was generally considered to be low. We also considered the risk of bias in outcome measurement to
   be low, except for the susceptibility to infection outcome in which about 46% of the studies were at
   risk of differential misclassification (i.e. due to low testing rates, some participants considered
   negative could have been unknown COVID-19 cases). Although it could not be ruled out, bias during
   the selection of the reported result was considered moderate since in the primary meta-analyses the
   raw count data was used to calculate effect estimates. At least one of the first two domains was rated
   serious for all estimates which implied that the overall risk of bias rating for all studies had to be rated
   ‘serious’. Because all estimates were rated as having a serious risk of bias, no sensitivity analyses based
   on methodological rigor were performed (the risk of bias assessments for all individual estimates are
   shown in the corresponding forest plots).
   Meta-analysis
   Table 1, Tables S3-S27 and Figures S2-S60 summarise the pooled estimates for the associations
   between all cardiovascular drug exposures and the various COVID-19 clinical outcomes. The text
   below is focused on the most reported drug (ACEI/ARB) exposure.
   Susceptibility to infection
   Thirty-one studies reported count data and/or crude odds ratios (OR) for the association between
   ACEI/ARB exposure and susceptibility to infection (Figure S2). Seven studies were removed to
   minimize the inclusion of studies with overlapping data. The primary meta-analysis (24 studies)
                                                                  10

   revealed that ACEIs/ARBs were associated with higher odds of testing positive for COVID-19 (pooled
   unadjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.30, Figure 2). Heterogeneity was high (I2=93%) and could be
   explained by country (China versus other) and study design (multicentre vs single-centre, cohort/case
   series vs case-control) (Table S3). The pooled estimate was no longer statistically significant when
   analysis was restricted to only Chinese studies (n = 2), multicentre studies (n = 14), and case-control
   studies (n = 8) (Figure S2). The linear regression test of funnel plot asymmetry (Egger’s test, p = 0.89)
   was not significant (funnel plot in Figure S3). Six studies reported adjusted or propensity score–
   weighted odds ratios (pooled adjusted OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.10, I2=0%) while two studies reported
   adjusted hazards ratios (pooled adjusted HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.20, I2=0%) (Figure S2). Other
   cardiovascular drug classes included anticoagulants, antiplatelets, beta-blockers, calcium channel
   blockers, class III anti-arrhythmics (specifically amiodarone), diuretics and lipid modifying drugs.
   Except for beta-blockers and diuretics (unadjusted estimates), none of the other cardiovascular drug
   exposures (including ACEIs and ARBs assessed separately) were associated with susceptibility to
   infection as detailed in Table 1.
   Hospitalization
   Twenty-three studies explored the association between being hospitalized and being on ACEIs/ARBs
   (Figure S12). When three studies were excluded to reduce potentially overlapping data, ACEIs/ARBs
   were associated with higher odds of being hospitalized (pooled unadjusted OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.70 to
   2.98, I2=91%, Figure 2). Heterogeneity could be explained by study-level mean/median ages and the
   proportion of patients with hypertension (Table S7). Four studies included only hypertensive patients
   and for these, the pooled estimate lost statistical significance (Figure 3). We did not conduct sub-group
   analyses based on age because no two studies included patients of a unique age category. Publication
   bias assessment for the 20 studies did not reveal funnel plot asymmetry (Figure S13, Egger’s test p-
   value = 0.13). The pooled adjusted odds ratio (6 studies) was not statistically significant at 1.16 (95%
   CI 0.80 to 1.68, I2=53%), a result which was similar to the pooled adjusted hazards ratio (1.00, 95% CI
                                                                  11

   0.87 to 1.14, I2=0%, 2 studies) (Figure S12). Other cardiovascular drugs were also associated with
   higher odds of being hospitalized in unadjusted, but not adjusted, estimates (Table 1).
   Hospitalization length
   Twelve studies reported length of hospitalization (Figure S20) and for 11 of these without potentially
   overlapping datasets, ACEIs/ARBs were not significantly associated with longer hospitalization length
   (mean difference -0.45, 95% CI -1.33 to 0.43 days, I2=30%, Figure 2). When one study attributed 34%
   of the weight was excluded in a sensitivity analysis, the results were similar (mean difference -0.44,
   95% CI -1.66 to 0.77 days, I2=32%). Heterogeneity was moderate and explainable by both age and
   proportion of patients with hypertension (Table S10). When 9 studies that included only hypertensive
   patients were pooled, ACEIs/ARBs were associated with shorter hospitalization length although this
   benefit was small. Egger’s test was not statistically significant (p = 0.94, funnel plot in Figure S21). This
   outcome was not assessed for other cardiovascular drug exposures.
   Severity
   Seventy-six studies reported the association between ACEIs/ARBs and severity outcomes (Figure S22).
   Sixteen studies were excluded due to having potentially overlapping data which resulted in a primary
   meta-analysis of 60 studies in which ACEIs/ARBs were associated with higher odds of severe disease
   (pooled OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.77, I2=81%, Figure 2). Heterogeneity could be explained by country,
   study setting, sample size, study-level mean/median ages, and the proportion of patients with
   hypertension and diabetes mellitus (Table S11). Sub-group analyses based on country (South Korea
   versus other), in-patient study setting, and the proportion of patients with diabetes mellitus arrived
   at similar conclusions while the pooled estimates were no longer significant when only Chinese studies
   or hypertensive cohorts were pooled (Figure 3, Figure S22). Publication bias assessment for the 60
   studies revealed funnel plot symmetry (Figure S23, Egger’s test p = 0.15). Adjusted odds ratios were
   obtained from 18 studies (pooled adjusted OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.42, I2=65%) while hazard ratios
   were obtained from 4 studies (pooled adjusted HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.33, I2=68%) (Figure S22).
                                                                  12

   Except for antiplatelet exposure, other cardiovascular drugs were associated with higher odds of
   severe disease in the unadjusted estimates, with statistical significance being lost when adjusted
   estimates were considered (Table 1).
   All-cause mortality
   Seventy-three studies reported the association between ACEI/ARB exposure and all-cause mortality
   (Figure S40). Because some studies had potentially overlapping datasets, only 40 were included in the
   primary meta-analysis with ACEIs/ARBs not being associated with higher odds of all-cause mortality
   (pooled OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.58, Figure 2). Heterogeneity was high (I2=85%) and could be
   accounted for by country, sample size, study-level mean/median ages, and the proportion of patients
   with hypertension (Table S19). The direction of the pooled estimate was reversed and was statistically
   significant in 12 China-only studies (Figure S40) whilst when restricting the analysis to hypertensive
   cohorts only (n = 18), the result remained non-significant (Figure 3). Egger’s test was not statistically
   significant (p = 0.20, funnel plot in Figure S41). The pooled adjusted odds ratio (13 studies) was 0.86
   (95% CI 0.64 to 1.15, I2=4%) while the pooled adjusted hazards ratio (10 studies) was 0.94 (95% CI 0.79
   to 1.13, I2=29%) (Figure S40). Except for anticoagulants, other cardiovascular drugs were associated
   with higher odds of all-cause mortality in the unadjusted estimates. Statistical significance was lost for
   ACEIs, ARBs, anticoagulants, calcium channel blockers, and lipid-modifying drugs when adjusted ORs
   were pooled. When adjusted hazards ratios were considered, ACEIs, ARBs, calcium channel blockers
   and diuretics were not associated with all-cause mortality while lipid-modifying drugs (statins)
   decreased the odds of dying (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.96, I2=83%, Table 1).
   DISCUSSION
   We have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the current evidence on the
   influence of cardiovascular drugs on five COVID-19 clinical outcomes. The most reported drug classes
   were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with
                                                                  13

   ACEI/ARB exposure being associated with higher odds of testing positive for COVID-19, which
   contradicts a previous estimate by Zhang et al. (0.99, 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.04).10 Our study, which included
   24 studies for this outcome, is however more comprehensive than Zhang et al.’s which included only
   3 studies for the same outcome. Among COVID-19 patients, ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with
   being hospitalized, having severe disease but not hospitalization length or all-cause mortality. Diaz-
   Arocutipa et al.14 who explored these four outcomes reported similar results for hospitalization length
   (mean difference -0.96 days, 95%CI -2.50 to 0.57, n = 5 studies) and mortality (OR 1.11, 95%CI 0.77-
   1.60, n = 22 studies) but not for being hospitalized (OR 1.83, 95%CI 0.95-3.52, n = 4 studies) or having
   severe disease (OR 0.79, 95%CI 0.59-1.07, n = 18 studies) – differences we again attribute to our review
   being bigger in terms of the number of studies included. With a higher rate of hospitalization and more
   severe disease, one would respectively expect longer hospital stay and increased mortality, which
   makes our results seem counter intuitive. However, the length of hospitalization outcome excluded
   patients who died or those who were still hospitalized by the time of analysis, which may have
   contributed to the observed discrepancy. It is also important to note that these results are from
   pooling unadjusted estimates which did not account for confounding factors such as cardiovascular
   comorbidities. For instance, because hypertension might necessitate ACEI/ARB use, and hypertension
   contributes to poor COVID-19 clinical outcomes,8 36-39 estimates that do not adjust for hypertension
   might be spuriously elevated as seen above (an example of “confounding by indication”). Indeed,
   when subgroup analyses that included only hypertensive patients were conducted, ACEI/ARB
   exposure was no longer associated with being hospitalized or having severe disease. Lastly, co-
   interventions such as steroids and remdesivir that could influence these results could not be
   accounted for since studies rarely reported these co-interventions and stratified them by
   cardiovascular drug exposure.
   We also reported pooled adjusted estimates in which ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with
   higher odds of testing positive for COVID-19, being hospitalized, having severe disease, or all-cause
   mortality. Diaz-Arocutipa et al.14 reported similar estimates for all-cause mortality (adjusted hazards
                                                                  14

   ratio 0.83, 95%CI 0.49 to 1.38, n = 3 studies) but not severity (adjusted OR 0.56, 95%CI 0.37 to 0.87, n
   = 4 studies). Although pooling adjusted estimates can protect against the effect of confounders
   present in unadjusted estimates, these pooled adjusted estimates should still be cautiously
   interpreted since many did not include adjustment for important confounders, and odds/hazard ratios
   that adjust for different sets of covariates may not be comparable.47 Further, adjusted odds/hazards
   ratios are expected to be further from zero (the “non-collapsibility” of effect estimates).54
   Regarding other cardiovascular drug classes, this is the first review to be broad in this context (most
   previous reviews have focused solely on ACEIs/ARBs) with most other drugs not being associated with
   poor COVID-19 clinical outcomes in the pooled adjusted estimates. One key result is that lipid
   modifying drugs (statins in particular) appear to protect against all-cause mortality based on the
   adjusted hazards ratios, as has recently been reported.55 However, the number of included studies (n
   = 4) was small and the adjusted odds ratios were not statistically significant. The potential mechanisms
   in which cardiovascular drugs can influence COVID-19 outcomes have been previously discussed.6-9 22-
   25
   Limitations of this review
   For most of the meta-analyses, heterogeneity in effect estimates was high, which is similar to previous
   observations.10     12-14 17 18 21
                                         Consequently, following GRADE rating,52               53
                                                                                                  all estimates with high
   heterogeneity (I2 >70) were downgraded by one level (high to moderate certainty rating). Additionally,
   almost all estimates were ranked to be at a serious risk of bias. This differs from previous reviews in
   which many studies were considered to have low to moderate risk of bias,10-18 20 21 a contradiction we
   attribute to the risk of bias assessment tools used (whereas we used the ROBINS-I [Risk Of Bias In Non-
   randomised Studies – of Interventions] tool for non-randomized studies,32 other reviews used the
   Newcastle Ottawa Scale). Again following GRADE52 53 recommendations, the evidence certainty rating
   was downgraded by one level for estimates with a serious risk of bias (from high to moderate or from
   moderate to low). Despite our comprehensive search strategy and to facilitate timely publication, we
                                                                  15

   did not contact study authors for data that was required to enable meta-analysis but not reported in
   the published paper, and therefore did not include studies that could potentially be eligible. We were
   also unable to include many studies from some preprint servers such as Authorea.com, Preprints from
   Lancet, and Preprints.org. We were however cognizant of the fact that this is a living systematic review
   and any studies that we excluded due to data needed for meta-analysis not being reported, or that
   we missed in our initial searches may be included in subsequent updates. We also included several
   preprint publications that have not been certified by peer review. This we felt necessary since many
   COVID-19 studies are being first published as preprints and we will be reassessing the preprints that
   will be peer-reviewed in future updates. We tried to exclude potentially overlapping data – however,
   we may have missed some overlapping data or inadvertently excluded non-overlapping data. The
   overall low contributions/assigned weights of the individual studies make the reported estimates
   robust to these errors. We also relied on single-reviewer extraction for half the studies, which could
   introduce bias from simple errors. Any new information/inconsistencies that come to our attention
   will be incorporated in subsequent reviews. Lastly, we could not explore the interplay of the various
   cardiovascular drugs because the number of studies for many drug classes was small. Once more,
   preferably high-quality, studies become available, we will compare how the different drug classes
   perform in combination and against each other (for example propensity score stratified HRs suggest
   that ACEIs/ARBs combined with other drugs are similar to calcium channel blockers/thiazides (HR 1.01,
   95% CI 0.90 to 1.15) and ACEI combinations are more protective than ARB combinations (HR 0.88, 95%
   CI 0.79 to 0.99) in terms of susceptibility to infection56).
   Conclusions
   Low- to moderate-certainty evidence suggests that cardiovascular drugs are not associated with poor
   COVID-19 clinical outcomes in high-risk patients such as those with hypertension. High quality
   evidence in the form of randomized controlled trials is urgently required and will be incorporated in
   updates of this review as soon as it is available (several trials are currently ongoing such as the 3
   interventional phase III studies listed on ClinicalTrials.gov for Losartan [identifiers: NCT04343001,
                                                                  16

   between cardiovascular drugs and COVID-19 pathology is required at cellular and molecular level to
   resolve the biological plausibility arguments that support both harm and benefit from ARB/ACEI
   exposure.6-9 As we await further evidence, patients on cardiovascular drugs should continue taking
   their medications as is recommended worldwide for ARBs/ACEIs.
