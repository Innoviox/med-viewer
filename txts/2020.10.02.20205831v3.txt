70    ABSTRACT
71    Serological detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is essential for establishing rates of
72    seroconversion in populations, detection of seroconversion after vaccination, and for seeking
73    evidence for a level of antibody that may be protective against COVID-19 disease. Several
74    high-performance commercial tests have been described, but these require centralised
75    laboratory facilities that are comparatively expensive, and therefore not available universally.
76    Red cell agglutination tests have a long history in blood typing, and general serology through
77    linkage of reporter molecules to the red cell surface. They do not require special equipment,
78    are read by eye, have short development times, low cost and can be applied as a Point of Care
79    Test (POCT). We describe a red cell agglutination test for the detection of antibodies to the
80    SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). We show that the Haemagglutination Test
81    (“HAT”) has a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 99% for detection of antibodies after a PCR
82    diagnosed infection. The HAT can be titrated, detects rising titres in the first five days of
83    hospital admission, correlates well with a commercial test that detects antibodies to the RBD,
84    and can be applied as a point of care test. The developing reagent is composed of a previously
85    described nanobody to a conserved glycophorin A epitope on red cells, linked to the RBD from
86    SARS-CoV-2. It can be lyophilised for ease of shipping. We have scaled up production of this
87    reagent to one gram, which is sufficient for ten million tests, at a cost of ~0.27 UK pence per
88    test well. Aliquots of this reagent are ready to be supplied to qualified groups anywhere in
89    the world that need to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, but do not have the facilities for high
90    throughput commercial tests.

92    INTRODUCTION
93    Red cell agglutination tests have a distinguished history. Since Landsteiner’s classic
94    observations in 1901 (Landsteiner, 1961) (English translation), they have been used for the
                                                                      3

 95    determination of blood groups (Schwarz & Dorner, 2003) detection of influenza viruses (Hirst,
 96    1941) and in a wide variety of applications championed by Prof. Robin Coombs for the
 97    detection of specific antibodies or antigens (Coombs, Mourant, & Race, 1945) (reviewed by
 98    (Pamphilon & Scott, 2007)). They have the great advantage of being simple, inexpensive, can
 99    be read by eye, and do not require sophisticated technology for their application. In the
100    recent era the linkage of an antigen to the red cell surface has become easier with the
101    possibility of fusing a protein antigen sequence with that of a single domain antibody or
102    nanobody specific for a molecule on the red cell surface (discussed in (Habib et al., 2013)).
103
104    We have applied this concept to provide a simple Haemagglutination Test (“HAT”) for the
105    detection of antibodies to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
106    protein. The RBD is a motile subdomain at the tip of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that is
107    responsible for binding the virus to its ACE2 receptor. The RBD of betacoronaviruses folds
108    independently of the rest of the spike protein (Lan et al., 2020; Li, Li, Farzan, & Harrison, 2005;
109    Wang et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). This useful property provides an Achilles’ heel for the
110    virus and allows many potential applications in vaccine design (Dai et al., 2020; Mulligan et
111    al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Zha et al., 2020), and serology
112    (Amanat et al., 2020; Piccoli et al., 2020; The National SARS-CoV-2 Serology Assay Evaluation
113    Group,      2020),         see       also    www.gov.uk/government/publications/COVID-19-laboratory-
114    evaluations-of-serological-assays). The majority of neutralising antibodies bind to the RBD
115    (Barnes et al., 2020; Piccoli et al., 2020), and the level of antibody to the RBD detected in
116    ELISA correlates with that of neutralising antibodies (Amanat et al., 2020; Piccoli et al., 2020;
117    Robbiani et al., 2020). We reasoned therefore that a widely applicable and inexpensive test
118    for antibodies to the RBD would be useful for research in settings where high throughput
119    assays were not available.
120
121    In order to link the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to red cells we selected the single domain antibody
122    (nanobody) IH4 (Habib et al., 2013), specific for a conserved epitope on glycophorin A.
123    Glycophorin A is expressed at up to 106 copies per red cell. The IH4 nanobody has previously
124    been linked to HIV p24 to provide a monomeric reagent that bound p24 to the red cell surface.
125    Antibodies to p24 present in serum cross-linked the p24 and agglutinated the red cells (Habib
126    et al., 2013). We have adapted this approach to detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by
                                                                       4

129    has described preliminary results with an approach similar to ours, but using a fusion of the
130    RBD to an ScFV against the H antigen to coat red blood cells with the SARS-2 RBD (Kruse et
131    al., 2020).

146    RESULTS
147
148    Production of the IH4-RBD Reagent
149    The IH4-RBD sequence (Figure 1B) was codon optimised and expressed in Expi293F cells in a
150    standard expression vector (available on request). One advantage of this mode of production
151    compared to bacterially produced protein as used by Habib et al, is that the reagent will carry
152    the glycosylation moieties found in humans, which may play a role in the antigenicity of the
153    RBD (Pinto et al., 2020). The protein (with a 6xHis tag at the C-terminus for purification) was
154    purified by Ni-NTA chromatography which yielded ~160 mg/L. We later had one gram of the
155    protein synthesised commercially by Absolute Antibody, Oxford. The IH4-RBD protein ran as
156    single band at ~40 kDa on SDS PAGE (Figure 1C).
157
158    Establishment of the Haemagglutination Test (HAT) with monoclonal antibodies to the RBD
159    One purpose envisaged for the HAT is for use as an inexpensive Point of Care Test for
160    detection of antibodies in capillary blood samples obtained by a “finger-prick”. We therefore
161    wished to employ human red cells as indicators without the need for cell separation or
162    washes, to mimic this setting. The use of V-bottom microtiter plates to perform simplified
163    hemagglutination tests was first described over 50 years ago (Wegmann & Smithies, 1966).
164    In preliminary tests, we observed that 50 µL of whole blood (K2EDTA sample) diluted 1:40 in
165    phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), placed in V-bottomed wells of a standard 96-well plate,
166    settled in one hour to form a button of red cells at the bottom of the well. The normal
167    haematocrit of blood is ~40% vol/vol, so this dilution provides ~1% red cells. If the plate was
168    then tilted, the red cell button flowed to form a “teardrop” in ~30 seconds (for example Figure
169    2A Row 8).
170
171    If serum or plasma samples are to be tested, a standard collection of 10 mL of Type O Rh-
172    negative (O-ve) blood into a K2EDTA tube will thus provide sufficient red cells for 8,000 test
173    wells.
174
175    A well characterised monoclonal antibody to the RBD, CR3022 (ter Meulen et al., 2006) added
176    to the red cells at between 0.5-32 ng/well in 50 µL, did not agglutinate the cells on its own
                                                                       6

178      µL PBS) induced a concentration dependent agglutination of the red cells, detected by the
179      formation of a visible mat or plug of agglutinated cells, and the loss of teardrop formation on
180      tilting the plate (Figure 2A). From repeated trials of this experiment we established that a
181      standard addition of 100 ng/well of the IH4-RBD developer (50 µL of a stock solution of 2
182      µg/mL in PBS) induced agglutination of 50 µL of 1:40 human red cells in the presence of as
183      little as 2 ng/well of the CR3022 monoclonal antibody. The standardised protocol used for the
184      subsequent tests were thus performed in 100 or 150 µL final volume, containing 100 ng of
185      the IH4-RBD developer, and 50 µL 1:40 whole blood (~1% v/v red cells ~ 0.5 µL packed red
186      cells per reaction). After 60 minutes incubation at room temperature, we routinely
187      photographed the plates after the 30 s tilt for examination and reading.
188
189      The requirement for 100 ng of the IH4-RBD developer per test well means that the gram of
190      IH4-RBD protein we have had synthesised is sufficient for 10 million test wells at a cost of
191      approximately 0.27 UK pence per test.

198      IH4-RBD. From this titration, 100 ng/well of IH4-RBD was chosen for detection.

202    last dilution without tear drop formation on tilting the plate for ~ 30 s. The binding sites for
203    CR3022, EY6A and ACE2 on RBD have been defined (Huo, Zhao, et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020;
204    Yan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). EW-9B and EW-9C are monoclonal antibodies against non-
205    RBD epitopes on the spike protein (Huang et al., 2020). ACE2-Fc has been described (Huang
206    et al., 2020).
207
208    Having established a standard addition of 100 ng/well of the IH4-RBD reagent, we screened a
209    set of twelve human monoclonal antibodies, two divalent nanobodies, and divalent ACE2-Fc,
210    that are known to bind to the RBD (Huang et al., 2020; Huo, Le Bas, et al., 2020; Pinto et al.,
211    2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). These reagents bind to at least three independent
212    sites on the RBD, and some are strongly neutralising and capable of profound ACE2 blockade
213    (Huang et al., 2020; Huo, Le Bas, et al., 2020). Twelve of the 15 divalent molecules
214    agglutinated red cells and titrated in the HAT to an end point between 2-125 ng/well, after
215    addition of 100 ng IH4-RBD (Figure 2B and Supplementary Table 1). Two monoclonal
216    antibodies, FD-5D and EZ-7A (Huang et al., 2020) and one divalent nanobody VHH72-Fc
217    (Wrapp et al., 2020), failed to agglutinate red cells in the presence of the IH4-RBD reagent.
218    However, if a monoclonal antibody to human IgG was added to the reaction (50 µL of mouse
219    anti-human IgG, Sigma Clone GG5 1:100), these molecules specifically agglutinated the red
220    cells (Supplementary Figure 1A, B). This result, analogous to the “indirect” Coombs Test
221    (Coombs et al., 1945; Pamphilon & Scott, 2007), suggested that these three molecules had
222    bound to the RBD associated with the red cells but failed to crosslink to RBDs on neighbouring
223    red cells. However, these could be crosslinked by the anti IgG reagent. Monoclonal antibodies
224    to other regions of the spike protein (EW-9B, EW-9C and FJ-1C) failed to agglutinate red cells
225    (Figure 2B, Supplementary Table 1). Finally we looked at the effect of a divalent ACE2-Fc
226    molecule constructed by fusing the peptidase domain of ACE2 (amino acids 19-615) to the
227    hinge and Fc region of human IgG1 (described in (Huo, Le Bas, et al., 2020). ACE2-Fc
228    agglutinated red cells strongly in the presence of 100 ng/well of the IH4-RBD developer,
229    titrating to ~ 4 ng/well (Figure 2B rows 7,8).
230
231    In summary, these results showed that all of the known epitopes bound by characterised
232    monoclonal antibodies were displayed by the IH4-RBD reagent, as well as the ACE2 binding
233    site, and could mediate agglutination by specific antibodies, divalent nanobodies, or ACE2-Fc.

235    Agglutination by plasma from donors convalescing from COVID-19
236    These experiments established the conditions for detection of haemagglutination by
237    monoclonal antibodies to the RBD, in particular the optimum concentration of IH4-RBD of
238    100 ng/well. We then proceeded to look for haemagglutination by characterised plasma from
239    COVID-19 convalescent donors. In the first trial we tested eighteen plasma samples from
240    patients with mostly mild illness, that had been characterised with a quantitative ELISA to
241    detect antibodies to the RBD (Peng et al., 2020). For these experiments we used fresh O-ve
242    blood (K2EDTA sample) diluted to 1:40 as a source of red cells to avoid agglutination by
243    natural agglutinins in the plasma. Plasmas were titrated by doubling dilution from 1:20 in 50
244    µL, then 50 µL of 1:40 O-ve red cells were added, followed by addition of 100 ng of the IH4-
245    RBD in 50 µL PBS. After one-hour incubation, plates were tilted for ~30 seconds,
246    photographed and read. The titre of agglutination was assessed by complete loss of teardrop
247    formation by the red cells, any formation of a teardrop was regarded as negative. Figure 3A
248    shows that the HAT titre matched the RBD ELISA results. Four samples were scored as
249    negative in both assays. The remaining results showed that in general the HAT titre increased
250    with the ELISA end point titre. One sample gave a positive titre of 1:320 in the HAT but was
251    negative in ELISA (indicated with an arrow). We investigated this sample with a developer
252    composed of the IH4 nanobody without the RBD component, which revealed that
253    agglutination was RBD dependent (not shown). This sample was also positive at 1:1123 in an
254    ELISA for full length spike protein (not shown), which suggests that the antibodies contained
255    in this serum recognised epitope(s) present on the RBD exposed in the HAT, but not on the
256    RBD in the RBD-ELISA reference test (Peng et al., 2020). The highest titre detected in these
257    samples by the HAT was 1:1280 (Figure 3B).
258
259    These preliminary results showed that the HAT could detect antibodies to the RBD in plasma
260    samples from convalescent patients in a similar manner to an ELISA test, but were not
261    sufficient to establish the sensitivity and specificity of the HAT.

264      A) Eighteen plasma samples from mild cases were compared for titration in the HAT with 1:40
265      O-ve whole blood from a seronegative donor, and endpoint titre in an RBD ELISA (Peng et al.,
266      2020)). Four samples were negative in both assays. The data point marked with an arrow on
267      the graph (plasma 2 on the plate, Fig 3B) was checked with a reagent composed of IH4 without
268      RBD and shown to be dependent on antibodies to the RBD. This sample did score positive for
269      antibodies to full length spike in an ELISA (EPT 1:1123).

273      Sensitivity and specificity of the Haemagglutination Test
274      To formally assess the sensitivity and specificity of the HAT we collected a set of 98 “positive”
275      plasma samples from donors diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR at least 28 days prior to
276      sample collection (NHS Blood and Transplant), and 199 “negative” serum samples from
277      healthy donors from the pre-COVID-19 era (Oxford Biobank). The samples were randomised
278      before plating. The test wells were arranged in duplicate to contain serum/plasma at 1:40
279      dilution, and 1:40 O-ve red cells in 50 µL. 100 ng of IH4-RBD in 50 µL PBS was added to one
280      well of the pair, 50 µL of PBS to the other (as a negative control). The negative control is
281      important because in rare cases, particularly in donors who may have received blood
282      transfusions, the sample may contain antibodies to non-ABO or Rhesus D antigens. After
283      development, the plates were photographed, and read by two independent masked
284      observers. Complete loss of teardrop was scored as positive, any flow in the teardrop as
                                                                                          10

285    negative. These rules were established before setting up the tests. Disagreements (7%
286    overall) were resolved by accepting the weaker interpretation – i.e. if one observer scored
287    positive but the other negative, the well was scored as negative. Having completed the
288    scoring the columns of samples were re-randomised and the test and scoring repeated.
289
290    Examples of test wells and scoring are shown in Figure 4. The red cells in the negative control
291    (PBS) wells formed a clear teardrop. Red cells in positive wells (indicated with a solid ring)
292    settled either into a mat or a button that failed to form any teardrop on tilting for 30 seconds.
293    Occasional wells (15 of 297) formed a “partial” teardrop (shown by a dashed ring). These were
294    scored as negative by prior agreement.
295
296    With these rules in place we obtained in the first run sensitivity 88%, specificity 99%, and in
297    the second run sensitivity 93%, specificity 99% (Figure 4). The Siemens Atellica
298    Chemiluminescence assay for detection of IgG antibodies to the RBD was run in parallel on
299    293 of these 297 samples and gave sensitivity 100%, specificity 100% for this sample set.
300
301    We decided prior to this formal assessment to score wells with partial teardrop formation as
302    negative, as these wells tended to give rise to disagreements between scorers and were not
303    very helpful. Fifteen of 297 wells gave a partial teardrop. Six of these fifteen were from PCR-
304    ve donors and scored negative on the Siemens assay, 9/16 were from PCR+ve donors and
305    were Siemens positive. If partial teardrops were scored as positive, the sensitivity of the two
306    assays increased to 97% and 99% (from 88% and 93%), but specificity was reduced to 96%
307    and 98% (from 99%). This small loss of specificity would be unacceptable in sero-surveys
308    where the expected prevalence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was low.

311 Figure 4. Operating characteristics of the HAT.
312 A) The test set of 297 randomised plasma samples were diluted 1:40 mixed with 1:40 O-ve
313 blood in two columns. IH4-RBD (100 ng in 50 µL) was added to the test samples, and PBS to
314 negative control wells. The plates were incubated at room temperature for one hour to allow
315 the red cell pellet to form, then tilted for ~30 seconds to allow a teardrop to form. Complete
316 loss of teardrop was scored as positive agglutination (marked with a black solid-line circle).
317 Full teardrop or partial teardrop (marked with a dotted-line circle) were scored negative. The
318 samples in columns were re-randomised and tested for a second time two days later.

321 HAT in the Hospital Setting
322 We next assessed the HAT in the setting of patients recently admitted to hospital (the first
323 five days) through access to the COMBAT collection of samples (see methods). This set
324 comprised 153 plasma samples from donors diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR, with clinical
325 syndromes classified as « Critical », « Severe », « Mild », and «PCR positive Health Care
326 Workers ». Seventy-nine control plasma samples donated in the pre-COVID-19 era were
                                                     12

327 obtained either from patients with bacterial sepsis (54 samples), or healthy volunteers (25
328 samples). Samples were titrated in 11 doubling dilutions of 50 µL from 1:40 – 1:40,096
329 (columns 1-11). Column 12 contained 50 µL PBS as a negative control. 50 µL of 1:40 O-ve
330 whole blood was added, followed by 50 µL of 2 µg/mL IH4-RBD (100 ng/well). In parallel, all
331 of the 153 samples from PCR positive donors were assessed by the Siemens Atellica
332 Chemiluminescence test for antibodies to the RBD of the spike protein. The HAT scores (as
333 the number of doubling dilutions of the sample required to reach the endpoint of complete
334 loss of teardrop), and representative agglutination results are shown in figure 5A. In Figure
335 5B the HAT scores are plotted with their related Siemens test scores.
336
337 None of the seventy-nine negative control samples scored as positive in the HAT at a dilution
338 of 1:40, thus providing 100% specificity in this set of samples. The HAT detected 131/153 (86%
339 sensitivity) of the samples from PCR-diagnosed donors within the first five days of hospital
340 admission, whereas the Siemens test detected 113/153 (74%). On day 5 the HAT detected
341 41/45 (91% sensitivity). Two samples had an endpoint greater than 11 doubling dilutions in
342 the HAT, and required a repeat measurement spanning two plates. These two samples
343 titrated to 13 doubling dilutions (1: 163,840). Unmasking the samples revealed that both were
344 acquired from an elderly lady with mild disease on days 3 and 5 of her admission. The range
345 of positive titres detected by HAT was broad: 1 to 13 doubling dilutions (1:40 – 1:163,840). A
346 correlation coefficient with the Siemens test could not be calculated as the latter has a ceiling
347 score of 10 (Figure 5B). A comparison of the two tests in a contingency table with cut-off of
348 1:40 (first doubling dilution) for HAT, and a score ≥ 1 for the Siemens test (as defined by the
349 manufacturer), showed a strong correlation between the two tests for detection of antibodies
350 to the RBD (P <0.0001; two-tailed Fisher’s exact test, Figure 5B). Fifty-two of the 153 samples
351 were from 24 donors with COVID-19 from whom repeated samples were taken on days 1, 3,
352 or 5 of admission. The HAT detected a rise in agglutination titre over the first five days of
353 admission in 16/24 (67%) of these patients (Table 1). Reductions in titre were not detected.

357   39 samples from 32 Mild, 20 single samples from health care workers (HCW), 54 samples from
358   43 patients with unrelated sepsis in the pre-COVID-19 era, 25 samples from healthy
359   unexposed controls. Median is indicated by a red line. DD: doubling dilutions.
360   B) Comparison to Siemens Result (anti RBD) with HAT titre by doubling dilution for 153
361   samples from Critical, Severe, Mild and HCW SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive donors.
362
363   These results showed that in the setting of hospital admission in the UK for suspected COVID-
364   19 disease, the HAT has an overall sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 100% by day five, and
365   frequently (67%) detected a rise in HAT titre during the first five days of admission. In this
366   context the HAT performed at least as well as the commercially available Siemens Atellica
367   Chemiluminescence assay (74%) for the detection of antibodies to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2
368   spike protein. Twenty samples were negative in both tests, but nine of these were taken on
                                                                                                          14

369 day 1 of admission, which suggests that both tests have lower detection levels early in the
370 course of hospital admission, before the antibody response has fully developed.
371
372 The O-ve blood used as indicator for this experiment was collected into a heparin tube, and
373 then transferred to a K2EDTA tube. In order to be sure that the presence of heparin in the red
374 cells had not altered the behaviour of the test, and to confirm the robustness of the results,
375 we repeated the titrations on all of the 232 samples 34 days later, with fresh O-ve red cells
376 from a different donor collected as usual into a K2EDTA tube. The results are shown in
377 supplementary figures 2A-C. Specificity of the HAT remained at 100% (none of the 79 control
378 samples were detected as positive at 1:40). The correlation with the previous assay was
379 strong (R2 = 0.975), and 99% of the 232 titrations were within one doubling dilution of the
380 matched earlier measurement. The slope of the correlation was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.96),
381 significantly less than 1. This was due to a proportion of results titrating to one doubling
382 dilution lower titre. However, this had only a small impact on sensitivity (81% from 86%),
383 which was still an improvement on the Siemens test (74%) in this context of the first five days
384 of hospital admission. A rise in HAT titre in 16/24 during the first five days of admission was
385 confirmed.

406 HAT as a Point of Care Test on Capillary Samples
407 The HAT is designed to detect antibodies to the RBD starting at a serum dilution of 1:40, and
408 we have found that that 50 µL of 1:40 dilution of whole blood provides an optimal
409 concentration of red blood cells for detection by agglutination in V-bottomed 96 well plates.
410 We have not completed an extensive analysis of the HAT as a Point of Care Test. However,
411 we have preliminary evidence that lyophilised IH4-RBD sent to the National Institute of
412 Immunology, New Delhi, functions as a Point of Care Test on capillary blood obtained by
                                                  16

413 finger-prick. In Figure 6, three positive (donors 1, 2 and 3) and three negative (donors 4, 5 and
414 6) HAT results are compared to a standard ELISA for detection of antibodies to the RBD.
415
416
417 Figure 6. HAT as a point of care test.
418 Capillary blood samples were obtained by lancet. Antibodies to the RBD were detected by
419 HAT on autologous red cells in the sample in “Test” wells (plasma at 1:40) after addition of
420 100 ng/well IH4-RBD (see methods). NC, Negative Control (PBS replaces IH4-RBD); PC Postive
421 Control (20 ng/well CR3022, an anti-RBD monoclonal antibody added). In parallel, after
422 removal of red cells, the plasma was tested in a standard ELISA for detection of antibodies to
423 the RBD. Low levels of antibody detected in the ELISA were sufficient to give a positive result
424 in the HAT.
425
426 Further work is needed to establish the operating characteristics of the HAT as a Point of Care
427 Test on capillary samples. We provide a suggested operating procedure for capillary samples
428 in methods.

430 Distribution of the IH4-RBD as lyophilised protein
431 In order to ship the IH4-RBD reagent efficiently we have examined the effects of lyophilisation
432 and reconstitution with water. IH4-RBD synthesised for the purpose of distribution was
433 provided at 5 mg/mL in PBS by Absolute Antibody Ltd, Oxford. Two hundred microlitre
434 aliquots (1 mg, enough for 10,000 test wells) were lyophilised overnight and stored at -20 °C.
435 Aliquots were thawed, reconstituted with 1 ml double distilled water and titrated against the
436 pre-lyophilisation material. No change in the titration occurred. We have synthesised one
                                                    17

437 gram of IH4-RBD, sufficient for 10 million test wells. This is available free of charge for any
438 qualified group anywhere in the world in aliquots of 1 mg (20,000 test wells).

440 DISCUSSION
441 The COVID-19 pandemic has had a particularly gruelling influence on the world economy, and
442 on most populations of the world. The appearance of such a new highly contagious virus will
443 probably not be a unique occurrence in the decades ahead. One of the lessons learned is the
444 importance of developing affordable serological tests for detection of immune responses to
445 SARS-CoV-2. Commercial antibody tests are not widely available to low- and middle-income
446 countries, and lateral flow assays, while offering early promise as a near-patient test, have
447 failed to deliver in terms of performance metrics, are expensive, and there are concerns about
448 significant batch-to-batch variation (Adams et al., 2020). By contrast, the advantages of the
449 HAT are the low cost of production of its single reagent (~0.27 UK pence per test well), better
450 performance than most lateral flow devices (Adams et al., 2020), and versatility in not
451 requiring anything other than a source of O-ve blood (10 mL of K2EDTA blood provides
452 enough for 8,000 tests), an adjustable pipette, PBS, and a standard 96 well V-bottomed plate.
453
454 We have demonstrated that the HAT functions as a viable test for the presence of antibodies
455 to the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in stored serum/plasma samples, using O-ve red
456 cells as indicators. In the formal assessment of sensitivity and specificity we recorded an
457 average 90% sensitivity and 99% specificity (Likelihood Ratio ~175), compared to 100%
458 sensitivity and 100% specificity for the Siemens Atellica Chemiluminescence test on the same
459 set of samples. The “positive” samples were selected to have been taken at least 28 days after
460 a positive PCR test. These conditions are optimal for serological tests by allowing time for a
461 rise in antibodies. The sensitivity of ~90% and specificity of 99% did not reach the level of
462 98% for both recommended by the UK MHRA (The National SARS-CoV-2 Serology Assay
463 Evaluation Group, 2020), or 99.5% for both recommended by the Infectious Disease Society
464 of America (Hanson et al., 2020). However, these values are still consistent with a useful test
465 in appropriate contexts, provided that users are fully aware of the operating characteristics
466 and interpret the results correctly.
467
                                                   18

468 The sensitivity of the single point HAT can be enhanced (to ~98%) if wells with partial teardrop
469 formation are scored as positive. However, this improvement in sensitivity is gained at the
470 expense of a reduced specificity (to ~97%). If partial teardrops are to be scored as positive in
471 the spot test at 1:40, we recommend obtaining confirmation for these by ELISA. Improvement
472 in the operating characteristics of the HAT may be possible by a systematic analysis of buffer
473 composition and experimental conditions, and is being investigated. We have deliberately
474 kept complexity to a minimum, and thus all dilutions were made in standard PBS, and for the
475 moment we recommend scoring wells with partial teardrop formation as negative.
476
477 It is interesting that the HAT titrations actually performed a little better than the Siemens test
478 on 153 stored plasma samples from donors during the first five days of their hospital
479 admission (note that symptom onset may have been several days earlier), in whom it
480 detected 86% (81% in the repeat) of samples from PCR-diagnosed donors, compared to 74%
481 for the Siemens test, and gave 100% specificity for the sample set containing control plasma
482 from patients with sepsis and healthy controls. We speculate that at this early period of the
483 COVID-19 illness the immune response may be dominated by IgM that would be expected to
484 be particularly efficient at crosslinking the IH4-RBD labelled red cells. In addition, of the
485 twenty-four donors who were tested more than once in the first five days in hospital, the HAT
486 detected a rise in titre in sixteen (67%). A fixed high titre was detected in a further four to
487 provide a sensitivity of 83% in these twenty-four cases. In situations of high clinical suspicion,
488 the HAT could potentially have a place as a helpful test to support the diagnosis of COVID-19
489 by detecting a rising titre of antibodies to the RBD during hospital admission. In patients with
490 a prior probability of a diagnosis of COVID-19 of ~10%, the likelihood ratio of ~175 for the HAT
491 provides a posterior probability of ~95% for this diagnosis. However, it is essential that if
492 clinicians use a rising titre in the HAT as a diagnostic aid, they should be aware of the relatively
493 low sensitivity (~67%) in this context.
494
495 With a specificity of 99%, the HAT could be employed for epidemiological surveys of the
496 seropositive rate in stored serum/plasma samples from populations with a moderate
497 expected prevalence ~10%, which would entail a negative predictive value of ~90%. The HAT
498 may be useful to detect seroconversion after vaccination, and for the identification of
499 potential donors of high titre plasma for therapy, if the clinical trials that are in progress
                                                      19

500 demonstrate a benefit. In the absence of knowledge about the level of antibody that indicates
501 protection, the HAT should not be used to provide personal results to individuals, as discussed
502 by the UK Royal College of Pathologists (https://www.rcpath.org/profession/on-the-
503 agenda/COVID-19-testing-a-national-strategy.html). Finally, we show that the lyophilised
504 IH4-RBD reagent sent to New Delhi functioned as expected in preliminary point of care testing
505 on capillary samples obtained by finger-prick. However, additional evidence is needed to
506 show that the sensitivity and specificity of the HAT, applied as a Point of Care Test in this way,
507 are comparable to the tests on stored plasma samples, as stressed by the IDSA guideline on
508 serological testing (Hanson et al., 2020). This will need to be done in field conditions, which is
509 planned.
510
511 The technique required for applying the HAT can be learned in a day by a trained laboratory
512 technician, paramedic, nurse or doctor. We have produced one gram of the developing IH4-
513 RBD reagent (enough for ten million test wells) and offer to ship lyophilised aliquots of this
514 material (sufficient for 10,000 tests) anywhere in the world, free of charge, for use as a
515 research reagent for serological studies of COVID-19.

517 METHODS
518
519 Sample Collection and Ethics
520 Figures 1,2: Control whole blood (K2EDTA) as a source of red cells was collected from a
521 healthy donor after informed consent.
522
523 Figure 3: Pre-pandemic negative controls: these samples were collected from healthy adults
524 in the Oxfordshire region of the UK between 2014 and 2016, ethics approval: Oxfordshire
525 Clinical Research Ethics Committee 08/H0606/107+5. Positive sample set: these were
526 convalescent plasma donors recruited by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), ethics approval
527 (NHSBT; RECOVERY [Cambridge East REC (ref: 20/EE/0101)] and REMAP-CAP [EudraCT 2015-
528 002340-14] studies).
529
530 Figures 4, 5 and Table 1: Known COVID-19 positive samples were collated from three ethically
531 approved studies: Gastro-intestinal illness in Oxford: COVID substudy [Sheffield REC,
                                                    20

532 reference: 16/YH/0247]ISARIC/WHO, Clinical Characterisation Protocol for Severe Emerging
533 Infections [Oxford REC C, reference 13/SC/0149], the Sepsis Immunomics project [Oxford REC
534 C, reference:19/SC/0296]) and by the Scotland A Research Ethics Committee (Ref:
535 20/SS/0028). Patients were recruited from the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, UK, between
536 March and May 2020 by identification of patients hospitalised during the SARS-COV-2
537 pandemic and recruited into the Sepsis Immunomics and ISARIC Clinical Characterisation
538 Protocols. Time between onset of symptoms and sampling were known for all patients and if
539 labelled as convalescent patients were sampled at least 28 days from the start of their
540 symptoms. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. All patients were
541 confirmed to have a test positive for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcriptase polymerase
542 chain reaction (RT-PCR) from an upper respiratory tract (nose/throat) swab tested in
543 accredited laboratories. The degree of severity was identified as mild, severe or critical
544 infection according to recommendations from the World Health Organisation. Severe
545 infection was defined as COVID-19 confirmed patients with one of the following conditions:
546 respiratory distress with RR>30/min; blood oxygen saturation<93%; arterial oxygen partial
547 pressure (PaO2) / fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2) <300 mmHg; and critical infection was defined
548 as respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or shock; or other organ failures
549 requiring admission to ICU. Comparator samples from healthcare workers with confirmed
550 SARS-CoV-2 infection who all had mild non-hospitalised disease were collected under the
551 Gastro-intestinal illness in Oxford: COVID sub-study, and samples from patients with
552 equivalently severe disease from non-COVID infection were available from the Sepsis
553 Immunomics study where patients presenting with significantly abnormal physiological
554 markers in the pre-pandemic timeframe had samples collected using the same methodology
555 as that applied during the COVID pandemic. Blood samples were collected in K2EDTA
556 vacutainers and PBMCs were separated from plasma using Sepmate isolation tubes
557 (STEMCELL Technologies) and plasma was used in the downstream HAT assay.

564 Cloning, Expression and Purification of VHH(IH4)-RBD
565 The codon-optimised gene encoding IH4-RBD sequence (Figure 1B and supplementary for the
566 cDNA sequence) was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. The gene was cloned in
567 to the AbVec plasmid (Genbank FJ475055) using the restriction sites AgeI and HindIII (the
568 vector supplied the signal sequence). This expression plasmid for IH4-RBD is available on
569 request. Protein was expressed in Expi293FTM cells using the manufacturer's protocol
570 (Thermo Fisher). Protein supernatant was harvested on day 5/6 after transfection, spun and
571 0.22 µm filtered. The protein was affinity-purified using a His-Trap HP column (Cytiva). Binding
572 buffer consisted of 20 mM Sodium Phosphate, 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM Imidazole at pH 7.4,
573 and the elution buffer of 500 mM Imidazole in 1 x binding buffer. Protein was concentrated
574 using 15 ml Vivaspin 30 kDa MWCO filter and then buffer exchanged to PBS using a 10 ml 7
575 kDa Zebaspin column (Thermo Fisher).
576
577 For large scale production, the protein was synthesized by Absolute Antibody Ltd, Oxford
578 using the same plasmid construct in HEK293 cells.
579
580 Lyophilisation of IH4-RBD and CR3022 monoclonal antibody
581 For lyophilisation, 200 μL (1 mg) of IH4-RBD (5 mg/mL) and 100 μL (200 μg) CR3022 mAb (2
582 mg/mL) in PBS buffer prepared in Protein Lo-Bind microcentrifuge tube (Fisher Scientific)
583 were frozen at -80 °C and further cooled down to - 196 °C using liquid nitrogen. Pre-cooled
584 samples were transferred to Benchtop K freeze-dryer (VirTis) with chamber at 49 µbar and
585 condenser pre-cooled to -72.5 °C. The samples were freeze-dried for a minimum of 24 h,
586 wrapped in Parafilm (Merck) and stored at -20 °C. Lyophilised sample was reconstituted in
587 the same original volume of MilliQ water.
588
589 Indirect ELISA to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG (Figure 6)
590 A standard indirect ELISA was used to determine the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG levels in plasma
591 samples. A highly purified RBD protein from SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain (NR-52306, BEI
592 Resources, USA), expressed in mammalian cells, was used to capture IgG in the plasma
593 samples. Briefly, ELISA plates (Nunc, Maxisorp) were coated with 100 µL/well of RBD antigen
594 diluted in PBS (pH 7.4) at the final concentration of 1 µg/mL and incubated overnight at 4°C.
595 Plates were washed three times with washing buffer (0.05% Tween-20 in PBS) followed by
                                                   22

596 the incubation with blocking buffer (3% Skim milk and 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS). The 3-fold
597 serially diluted heat inactivated plasma samples in dilution buffer (1% Skim milk and 0.05%
598 Tween-20 in PBS) were added into the respective wells, followed by incubation at room
599 temperature for 1 hour. After incubation, plates were washed, and anti-human IgG
600 conjugated with Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) (Southern Biotech) was added in each well.
601 After 1 h incubation, plates were washed and developed by OPD-substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) in
602 dark at room temperature. The reaction was stopped using 2N HCl and the optical density
603 (OD) was measured at 492 nm. The RBD-antigen coated wells that were added with sample
604 diluent alone were used as the blank. The OD values from sample wells were plotted after
605 subtracting the mean of OD values obtained in the blank wells.
606

625
626 1. Spot test on Stored Serum/Plasma samples (Figure 4).
                                                   23

627     1. Plate out 50 µL of 1:20 serum/plasma in alternate columns 1,3,5,7,9,11 (add 2.5 µL
628         sample to 47.5 µL PBS).
629     2. Add 50 µL 1:20 O-ve blood collected in (so that now sample is diluted to 1:40 and red
630         cells at ~1% v/v)
631     3. Mix and transfer 50/100 µL to neighbouring columns 2,4,6,8,10,12 for -ve controls.
632         The negative control is important because in rare cases, particularly in donors who
633         have received blood transfusions, the sample in principle may contain antibodies to
634         non-ABO or Rhesus D antigens.
635     4. Add 50 µL IH4-RBD reagent (2 µg/mL in PBS = 100 ng/well) to Columns 1,3,5,7,9,11
636     5. Add 50 µL PBS to columns 2,4,6,8,10,12.
637     6. Inc 1 hr RT
638     7. Tilt for 30 seconds
639     8. Photograph: with mobile phone use the zoom function to obtain a complete field
640     9. Read as Positive = No teardrop, Negative <1:40 = partial teardrop, Neg = complete
641         teardrop.
642     10. Two readers should read the plates independently, and disagreements resolved by
643         taking the lesser reading.
644     11. For each batch of samples set up positive control wells containing 20-100 ng
645         monoclonal antibody CR3022 (as in Finger-Prick test below). This establishes that all
646         of the reagents are working.
647
648 2. Titration of Stored Serum/Plasma Samples.
649     1. Dilute samples to 1:20 in 50 µL PBS (2.5 µL to 47.5 µL) in V-bottomed plate in Rows A-
650         H, column 1.
651     2. Prepare doubling dilutions with PBS across the plate columns 1-11 (1:40 to 1:40,960),
652         PBS control in column 12. Eight samples can be titrated per 96-well plate.
653     3. Add 50 µL 1:40 O-ve red cells (1% v/v or 1:40 fresh EDTA O-ve blood sample) to all
654         wells
655     4. Add 50 µL IH4-RBD (2 µg/mL, = 100 ng/well). [Note: the red cells and IH4-RBD can be
656         pre-mixed and added together in either 50 µL or 100 µL volume, to save a step. This
657         variation in technique does not alter the measured titres.]
658     5. Allow red cells to settle for 1 hr
                                                   24

659     6. Tilt plate for at least 30 s and photograph. The titre is defined by the last well in which
660         the tear drop fails to form. Partial teardrop regarded as negative.
661
662 3. Finger-prick test on capillary blood as a Point of Care Test
663     1. Preparation: Clean Hands, warm digit. Prepare a plate (96-well V-bottomed) labelled
664         with Date and Time.
665     2. Prick skin on outer finger pulp with disposable, single use BD or another Lancet.
666     3. Wipe away first drop of blood with sterile towel/swab
667     4. Massage second drop
668     5. Take a minimum of 5 µL blood with 20 µL pipette, mix immediately into 20 µL K2EDTA
669         (3.6 mg/mL/PBS) in Eppendorf. If possible, take 20 µL of blood and mix into 80 µL
670         K2EDTA solution. Another approach is collection of blood drops into a BD Microtainer
671         K2E EDTA lavender vials that take 250-500 µL.
672     6. For 5 µL sample dilute to 200 µL with PBS (add 175 µL PBS), for 20 µL sample dilute to
673         800 µL (add 700 µL PBS). Sample is now at 1:40, and the red cells are at the correct
674         density (~1% v/v assuming a haematocrit of 40%) to give a clear tear drop.
675     7. Plate 50 µL x 3 in V bottomed microtitre wells labelled T (Test), + (PC, positive Control),
676         - (NC, negative control) – see figure 6.
677     8. Add 10 µL of control anti RBD Mab CR3022 (2 µg/mL stock in PBS, 20 ng/well) to “+“
678         well
679     9. Add 50 µL IH4-RBD (2 µg/mL in PBS) to “T” (Test) and “+ve“ wells, 50 µL PBS to “-ve“
680         well.
681     10. Incubate 1 hour at RT for Red Cells to form a pellet in the “-ve“ well
682     11. Tilt plate against a well-lit white background for ~30 seconds to allow Tear drop to
683         form in “-ve“ well.
684     12. The presence of antibodies to RBD is shown by loss of Tear Drop formation in the “T“
685         and “+ve“ wells. Occasionally a partial tear drop forms – these wells are counted as
686         Negative.
687     13. Photograph the plate to record the results with the date and time. Results can be
688         reviewed and tabulated later. Taking picture from a distance and using the zoom
689         function helps to take a clear picture of all wells in a 96-well plate.
                                                    25

690     14. The negative (PBS) control should be done on every sample for comparison. The
691         Positive control induced by CR3022 is used to check that all the reagents are working,
692         and that the glycophorin epitope recognised by VHH(IH4) is present on the red cells.
693         Absence of the IH4 epitope should be very rare (Habib et al., 2013). For setting up
694         cohorts a positive control on every sample is therefore not necessary but should be
695         included in every batch of samples.
696     15. If a 20 µL sample of blood was taken from the finger prick there should be 650 µL of
697         the 1:40 diluted blood left. The red cells can be removed and a preparation of 1:40 O-
698         ve red cells used as above to titrate the sample. In principle the autologous red cells
699         could be washed repeatedly, resuspended in the same volume of PBS, and used as
700         indicators for the titration, however we have not attempted to do this. The s/n is 1:40
701         plasma that can be used in confirmatory ELISA or other tests.

872   Supplementary Figure 2. A) The 232 samples from figure 5 in the main paper were titrated a
873   second time 34 days after the first measurement, as described for figure 4 (Methods). The
874   values for the end point doubling dilution were compared and a correlation coefficient, and
875   slope calculated (Prism v8).
                                                                                                            33

876 B) The collection included 32 samples from 24 Critical patients, 62 samples from 48 Severe,
877 39 samples from 32 Mild, 20 single samples from health care workers (HCW), 54 samples from
878 43 patients with unrelated sepsis in the pre-Covid-19 era, 25 samples from healthy unexposed
879 controls. Median is shown.
880 C) Comparison to Siemens Result (anti RBD) with HAT Titre by Doubling Dilution for 153
881 samples from Critical, Severe, Mild and HCW PCR+ve donors. The sensitivity of the HAT in this
882 repeat was 81%, v 86% in the first test.

884 Supplementary Table 2. Fifty-two samples from 24 donors who were sampled repeatedly
885 during the first five days in hospital; assay repeated 34 days after the measurements in Table
886 1. Sixteen of 24 showed a rise in titre.
