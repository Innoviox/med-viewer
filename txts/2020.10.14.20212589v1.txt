                                                         ABSTRACT

   Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a common and distressing symptom of cancer and its

   treatments that may persist for years following treatment completion in approximately one-

   third of cancer survivors. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the pathophysiology

   of CRF. Using a comprehensive group of physiological and psychosocial variables, the aim of

   the present study was to identify correlates of CRF in a heterogenous group of cancer survivors.

   Ninety-three cancer survivors (51 fatigued, 42 non-fatigued, with grouping based on validated

   cut-off scores derived from The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue

   scale) completed assessments of performance fatigability (i.e. the change in maximal force-

   generating capacity, contractile function and capacity of the central nervous system to activate

   muscles caused by cycling exercise), cardiopulmonary exercise testing, venous blood samples

   for whole blood cell count and inflammatory markers and body composition. Participants also

   completed questionnaires measuring demographic, treatment-related, and psychosocial

   variables. The results showed that performance fatigability (decline in muscle strength during

   exercise), time-to-task-failure, peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2peak), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-

   α), body fat percentage and lean mass index were associated with CRF severity. Performance

   fatigability, V̇O2peak, TNF-α and age explained 35% of the variance in CRF severity.

   Furthermore, those with clinically-relevant CRF reported more pain, more depressive

   symptoms, less social support, and were less physically active than non-fatigued cancer

   survivors. Given the association between CRF and numerous physical activity related

   measures, including performance fatigability, cardiorespiratory fitness, and anthropometric

   measures, the present study identifies potential biomarkers by which the mechanisms

   underpinning the effect of physical activity interventions on CRF can be investigated.

                                                       INTRODUCTION

   Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is defined as a distressing, persistent sense of physical, emotional,

   and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes

   with usual functioning 1. CRF is often the most incapacitating and distressing symptom among

   people with cancer, above other common symptoms such as pain, nausea, and vomiting 2. As

   such, CRF can have widespread adverse emotional, social, and physical consequences. Indeed,

   CRF negatively impacts health-related quality of life (HRQL), and can interfere with a patient’s
                                                                                                                               3
   ability to perform activities of daily living and maintain functional independence                                              .

   Furthermore, there have been suggestions that CRF may impair the ability to complete medical

   treatments for cancer, and thus has potential implications for overall survival 4. Cancer-related

   fatigue is prevalent both at diagnosis and, to a greater extent, throughout treatment 5 6. However,

   while this symptom often improves after treatment, a substantial proportion, in the region of

   one-third of cancer survivors, report persistent CRF for months and years after cancer treatment
   6-8
         . In addition to the negative impact on HRQL, persistent CRF in cancer survivors can impact

   return to work, reduce the capacity to work 9, and result in increased utilization of health care

   resources 10, thereby having economic consequences.

              Given that the number of cancer survivors is increasing 11, the number of survivors with

   persistent CRF is likely to increase concomitantly. Despite an increased awareness of the

   prevalence of CRF in cancer survivors, relatively little is known regarding aetiology or risk

   factors. Although the aetiology remains elusive, it is understood that CRF is a multi-factorial

   process that is influenced by a variety of demographic, psychosocial and biological factors. For

   example, demographic factors such as marital status and income have previously been

   associated with CRF, with unmarried patients and patients with a lower household income
                                                  12
   reporting higher levels of fatigue                  . Co-occurring psychosocial factors such as depression,

   anxiety, and sleep disturbances, are frequently correlated with CRF 13-16. There is also evidence

   for the physiological underpinnings of CRF 17. For example, impairments in physical function

   owing to physical inactivity and deconditioning, neuromuscular alterations 18, reduced aerobic
               19                     20
   capacity         , and cachexia         have previously been associated with CRF. These perturbations

   could subsequently induce increases in fatigability and reduced exercise tolerance, thereby

   impairing the ability to perform every-day tasks and compounding CRF 21. Moreover, negative

   anthropometric changes, such as increases in body fat and reduced lean mass index, could

   further contribute to CRF through impaired physical function, with previous studies reporting

   links between CRF and anthropometric measures 22 23. Finally, chronic inflammation has also

   been linked with CRF, with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) 24-26, interleukin 1 beta (IL-

   1β) 27 and 6 (IL-6) 28 frequently implicated in neuro-immune interactions thought to exacerbate

   CRF. However, a comprehensive assessment of the potential objective physiological correlates

   of CRF is lacking. This understanding is essential, as these factors provide a target for future

   interventions to reduce CRF.

             Accordingly, this is the first study to investigate CRF and include several physiological

   variables via the assessment of neuromuscular function, maximal exercise capacity, body

   composition, complete blood count and inflammation, alongside assessments of psychosocial

   and disease-related outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify correlates of CRF and to

   examine differences in these outcomes between a heterogenous group of fatigued compared

   with non-fatigued cancer survivors.

                                                         METHODS

   Study population and recruitment

   The target population for the present study was cancer survivors following any cancer diagnosis

   and cancer treatment type. Participants were recruited via the Alberta Cancer Registry (Alberta

   Health Services, Canada). Data extraction criteria included age (≥ 18 years), diagnosed with

   any invasive cancer, and postal codes within 20 km of the University of Calgary. From the

   resulting extraction, equal numbers of males and females were randomly sampled and sent

   a confidential invitation letter from the registry (such that the research team did not know who

   received the invitation, but participants could then contact the research team if

   interested). Participants meeting these criteria were also recruited via liaising with clinicians

   and/or advertising at cancer centres local to the University of Calgary. Additional Inclusion

   criteria included 1) approval to participate from a Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology

   Certified Physiologist (CSEP-CEP) and/or a physician and 2) having command of the English

   language and ability to understand instructions related to the study procedure. Interested

   participants contacted the study coordinator via phone or email and were informed on the main

   aspects of the research. Potentially eligible participants were provided with a participant

   information sheet and were encouraged to ask questions about the risks and benefits of

   participation. Once participants had time to review the information, the first visit to the

   laboratory was scheduled. Initially, 64 participants were recruited. The study was later

   extended to include an exercise program29, and an additional 33 participants from that study

   with clinically relevant CRF were included in the present study. Therefore, a total

   of 97 participants provided written informed consent to participate and completed the

   study procedures.

   Procedures

   Approval for all procedures was obtained by the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board and

   the Health Research Ethics Board of Alberta Cancer Committee (REB14-0398 and

   HREBA.CC-16-10-10, respectively). Participants completed all assessments over two separate

   visits to the laboratory, separated by ~2 weeks to prevent fatigue from the initial visit

   influencing performance during the second visit. Laboratory visits commenced between 8 am

   – 9 am and lasted 2-3 hours. Visits were scheduled in the morning to ensure participants were

   as fresh as possible and to avoid fatigue accumulated throughout the day from influencing

   performance during the protocol. Participants were advised to consume breakfast 1.5 h prior to

   arrival at the laboratory, to arrive at the laboratory hydrated, and to refrain from alcohol,

   caffeine and strenuous activity for the preceding 24 h.




   Screening, medical and demographic information

   Prior to the study commencing, participants underwent a screening procedure. During the

   screening visit, participants completed a Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for

   Everyone (PAR-Q+), before being screened for arrhythmias and hypertension, determined

   during resting electrocardiography and blood pressure measurements, respectively. If the

   participant displayed a normal sinus rhythm and systolic and diastolic blood pressure of ≤ 144

   and ≤ 94 mmHg, respectively, was cleared for physical activity by a CSEP-CEP, and no further

   concerns were raised that would warrant physician approval, the participant continued to the

   procedures described for below. Otherwise, physician approval was sought. Medical

   information included the cancer and treatment type (surgery only, single modality, i.e.

   chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or multi-modality, i.e. chemotherapy and radiotherapy).

   Demographic information included age, sex, marital status (single, married, divorced,

   Patient reported outcomes

   The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) scale was used to

   assess CRF, with the score used as the dependent variable for the present study. This scale

   comprises 13 items, and delineates the physical and functional consequences of CRF 30. Using

   the FACIT-F scale, a score ≤ 34 is recommended for the diagnosis of CRF based on diagnostic

   interview 31. In addition to CRF severity, a number of other patient-reported outcomes were

   assessed. These included HRQL, depressive symptomatology, pain, social provisions, leisure-

   time exercise and insomnia severity. Questionnaires to measure these patient-reported

   outcomes were chosen based on their established reliability and validity with specific emphasis

   on use in cancer populations. Participants’ HRQL was assessed using the Functional

   Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General (FACT-G) 32, which includes subscales for physical,

   social/family, emotional and functional well-being, and additional concerns related to

   symptoms. Depressive symptomatology was assessed using the Center for Epidemiological

   Studies on Depression Scale (CES-D)                          . Pain severity and functional interference were

   assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-sf) 34. The Social Provisions Scale

   (SPS) 35 was used to assess social provisions, using the total score from six sub-group scores:

   guidance, reliable alliance, reassurance of worth, attachment, social integration, and

   opportunity for nurturance. The total physical activity score (leisure score index) and moderate

   and strenuous physical activity score ([moderate frequency per week × 5] + [strenuous

   frequency per week × 9]) derived from the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire

   (GLTEQ) 36 was used to assess leisure-time exercise.

   Physiological outcomes

   Cardiopulmonary exercise test

   Following the measurement of stature (cm) and mass (kg), a cardiopulmonary exercise test was

   performed to determine maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2peak), gas exchange threshold (GET) and

   respiratory compensation point (RCP). The tests were conducted using a custom-built

   recumbent ergometer, using an electromagnetically-braked Velotron system (RacerMate Inc.,

   Seattle, WA). Heart rate (HR) and breath-by-breath pulmonary gas exchange and ventilation

   was measured throughout the cardiopulmonary exercise test (Quark CPET, COSMED, Rome,

   Italy). The starting power output (25-50 W) and increment (8-20 W) were estimated and

   adjusted on an individual basis for a desired test duration of 8-12 min. The power output was

   increased at 1-min intervals until volitional exhaustion. Verbal encouragement was provided

   by the same experimenters every 20-60 s. The highest 30 s mean oxygen uptake was considered

   V̇O2peak. The GET and RCP were determined through visual inspection of relevant gas

   exchange variables. The GET was defined as the V̇O2 at which the rate of V̇CO2 began to

   increase disproportionally in relation to V̇O2, while the ventilatory equivalent of V̇CO2

   (V̇E/V̇CO2) and end-tidal PCO2 was stable 37. The RCP was defined as the V̇O2 at which end-

   tidal PCO2 began to decrease after a period of isocapnic buffering, as well as a second

   breakpoint in V̇E/V̇CO2, with further confirmation provided through examining the V̇O2 at

   which V̇E/V̇CO2 began to systemically increase 38.




   Venous blood sample

   A venous blood sample was collected from the antecubital fossa by a certified phlebotomist,

   with blood collected ≥ 2 h post-prandial. The sample was analysed for whole blood count

   (haemoglobin, white blood cell and platelet concentration), TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Whole

   blood count was analysed within 2 h of collection at the laboratory of Foothills Medical Centre

   (Calgary, Canada). Blood collected in an EDTA tuba was centrifuged at 4°C and 3000×g for

   15 min, divided into aliquots and stored at − 80°C. Samples were stored until laboratory

   evaluation, performed at Eve Technologies Corp (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) using the Bio-

   Plex™ 200 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA).




   Performance fatigability test

   The incremental cycling test was performed during the second visit to the laboratory, 2 weeks

   following the first visit in which the cardiopulmonary exercise test was performed. During the

   measurements of neuromuscular function are provided by Twomey et al.                                                . Briefly,

   participants performed an incremental cycling test to task-failure on a validated custom-built

   cycle ergometer, which permits the immediate assessment of neuromuscular function after

   cycling 29 39. Each stage of the cycling test lasted 3 min, beginning with a power output of 0.3

   W·kg-1, with an increment of 0.3 W·kg-1 for the next four stages and 0.4 W·kg-1 for the

   following five stages. Pre-exercise, between each stage, and following task-failure, a

   neuromuscular assessment was performed. The neuromuscular assessment consisted of

   participants performing a maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MVC) of the knee

   extensors of the right leg, delivering a supramaximal electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve

   during the plateau in MVC force, and delivering the same electrical stimulation 3 s following

   the MVC while the participants relaxed. The stimuli delivered during the plateau in MVC

   evoked a superimposed force response (superimposed twitch, SIT) while the subsequent

   stimulation delivered while participants relaxed evoked a resting twitch response (resting peak

   twitch force, Ptw, respectively) of the knee extensors. During cycling, participants received real-

   time feedback for cadence, which was self-selected by the participants (≥ 60 rpm). Participants

   were instructed to maintain their self-selected cadence, and verbal instructions were provided

   when the cadence drifted ≥ 4 rpm. The exercise was terminated when rpm fell below 60 rpm,

   or if participants verbally indicated that they were unable to continue the task.

             For the neuromuscular assessments throughout the incremental cycling test, the peak

   force during MVCs was calculated at each time-point. The amplitude of the potentiated

   mechanical response following a single electrical stimulus delivered on relaxed muscles was

   analysed to determine the Ptw. Voluntary activation was calculated using the interpolated twitch

   technique, where the amplitude of the superimposed twitch was normalised to the

   corresponding Ptw using the equation VA (%) = (1 – SIT/Ptw) × 100                               40

   measure of contractile function, while VA measures the capacity of the central nervous system

   to activate the muscle, and together these variables can determine the locus of reductions in

   MVC. The relative decline in MVC force, VA and Ptw compared to pre-exercise values at the

   final common stage (i.e. the minimum number of stages that all participants completed, which

   was three stages) and at task failure was analysed, as well as the total exercise duration.




   Body composition

   Participants underwent a whole-body scan using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA;

   Discovery W, Hologic, Bedford, MA), for the assessment of percentage body fat, body-mass

   index (BMI; kg/m2) and lean mass index (LMI; kg/m2).

   Statistical analysis

   were performed with the R statistical software package                              . Missing data was evident across

   multiple variables, with a maximum of nine (~10%) participants missing data for TNF-α, IL-

   1β and IL-6. Missing data were inputted using the k- nearest neighbour (k=5) method, from the

   ‘VIM’ package wherein 5 ‘(k’) samples were used to estimate the value of the missing data

   points 42. Patient demographics were compared between fatigue groups using Chi-squared and

   Mann-Whitney U-tests. Relevant predictors of FACIT-F score, and fatigue group were selected

   using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. LASSO

   regression is a sparse regularized regression which uses a penalty term to shrink regression

   coefficients and selects for only the most significant predictors. Ten-fold cross-validated linear

   and binomial LASSO regression was performed using the ‘glmnet’ package                                        43

   predictors from the linear LASSO regression were then subsequently entered into a robust

   regression model with FACIT-F score as the dependent variable. Selected predictors from the

   binomial LASSO regression were compared between groups using independent Student’s T-

   tests or Mann-Whitney U-tests where data violated assumptions of normality or homogeneity

   of variance, assessed using the Shapiro Wilk’s and Levene’s tests. Control for multiple testing

   (breast, prostate, head and neck, colon, haematological and other cancer types) and the three

   treatment type categories (surgery only, single modality and multiple modality) were assigned

   a number and entered into the model. The threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis was set at

   Of the 97 participants recruited, four were excluded due to having incomplete data sets.

   Specifically, participants who had ≥ 6 missing variables (with 6 variables equating to 37.5% of

   all included variables) were excluded, as it was deemed that too high a proportion of the data

   for those participants would be estimated. The data for 93 cancer survivors were thus analysed.

   Of the included participants, the percentage of missing data points was 6 ± 12%. The fatigued

   group comprised 51 participants (55%) with clinically-relevant fatigue: FACIT-F ≤ 34, n = 21

   from initial recruitment and n = 30 from subsequent RCT 29 (baseline measures). The remaining

   42 participants from the initial recruitment formed the non-fatigued group (FACIT-F > 34).

   The median age of the sample was 57 years (range 24-82 years), and 56 participants (60%)

   were female. Sex (χ2 = 1.0, p = 0.33) and age (U = 819, p = 0.05) were not different between

   fatigue groups. Participant socio-demographic and clinical characteristics are displayed in

   Table 1.

   Physiological outcomes and fatigue score – associations and between-group comparison

   Univariate analyses

   In the initial analysis, LASSO regressions identified seven variables as significant predictors

   of fatigue severity (FACIT-F score): three related to exercise (relative reduction in MVC post-

   stage 3, time to task failure during the fatigability test and V̇O2peak,), two related to body

   composition (body fat percentage and lean mass index), age and TNF-α concentration. The

   correlation matrix displaying the Spearman’s Correlation Coefficients for the associations

   between FACIT-F score and the identified predictors are displayed in Supplementary Figure

   1.




   Multivariate model predicting fatigue severity

   In a secondary analysis, the significant predictors of fatigue identified from the LASSO

   regressions were entered into a robust multivariate linear regression model. The results showed

   Between-group comparison

   For fatigue vs non-fatigued between-group comparison, the binomial LASSO regression

   identified four predictors of fatigue-group, including relative decrease in MVC post-stage 3,

   time-to-task failure, V̇O2peak, and TNF-α (Table 3; Figure 2A-D, respectively). Independent

   samples t-tests revealed that V̇O2peak (t91 = 4.2, P < 0.01, d = 0.86) and time to task failure (t91

   = 4.0, P < 0.01, d = 0.84) were lower in the fatigued group compared with the non-fatigued

   group, while the relative decrease in MVC post-stage 3 (t91 = 3.7,P < 0.01, , d = 0.77) and TNF-

   α (Mann Whitney U test U = 739, P = 0.01, , d = 0.55) were higher in the fatigued group

   compared with the non-fatigued group.

                                                        DISCUSSION

   The aim of the present study was to (i) identify correlates of CRF severity in a large cohort of

   cancer survivors using a comprehensive group of physiological and psychosocial variables,

   and (ii) examine differences in fatigued vs. non-fatigued cancer survivors. We identified that

   several variables measured during exercise testing, including cardiorespiratory fitness,

   alterations in neuromuscular function during exercise, and cycling exercise time were

   significantly associated with CRF severity. For the first time, we show that a decrease in the

   maximal force generating capacity caused by exercise is a significant independent predictor of

   CRF severity, alongside V̇O2peak, age and TNF-α concentration. Together, these four variables

   explained 35% of the variance in CRF severity. Furthermore, using the most widely-

   recommended measure of CRF severity and a cut-point based on diagnostic interview 31, we

   confirm earlier reports that people with clinically-relevant CRF experience more pain, more

   depressive symptoms, have less social support, and are less physically active than cancer

   survivors with no or mild fatigue.




   Performance fatigability

   Performance fatigability is defined as the change in an objective measure of physical
                                                               45
   performance measured following exercise                          . In the present study, participants performed

   incremental cycling exercise at intensities relative to their body mass, with cycling stages

   interspersed with assessments of neuromuscular function (MVC, Ptw and VA) in order to

   determine performance fatigability following the final common stage of cycling exercise and

   at task failure. A custom-built cycle ergometer which permits the immediate assessment of

   neuromuscular function between stages of cycling and following exercise was used to assess

                   39
   fatigability         . This original methodology provides a means of measuring neuromuscular

   function in response to an ecologically valid mode of exercise which resembles the type of

   activity performed in every-day life (i.e. whole-body, dynamic exercise). Furthermore, the

   ergometer permits the measurement of neuromuscular function without a delay between

   exercise cessation and the neuromuscular assessment, a delay that is normally associated with

   measuring fatigability in response to whole-body exercise 46. We found that fatigability at the

   final common stage of exercise (i.e. the final stage completed by all participants) was more

   pronounced in fatigued (–16%) compared with non-fatigued (–9%) participants, and was

   associated with fatigue severity. Likely due at least in part to the more rapid decline in

   neuromuscular capacity, the time-to-task-failure during the cycling task was 18% shorter in

   fatigued compared with non-fatigued participants. Using isometric exercise tasks, previous

   studies have similarly demonstrated that those with CRF reach task failure during sustained
                                                          18 47 48
   contractions more quickly than controls                           and that fatigability during isometric tasks is

   associated with CRF severity 49. However, the present study improves on previous designs by

   utilising a more ecologically valid exercise-mode to assess performance fatigability, as well as

   gold-standard assessments of neuromuscular function. These methods have previously been

   shown to be sensitive in detecting cancer treatment-induced changes in muscle function 50.

             While we have demonstrated that a relationship exists between fatigue severity and

   performance fatigability, the nature of this relationship, and whether impaired performance

   fatigability is a contributor or consequence of CRF, is unclear. For example, the impaired

   fatigability in those with CRF likely occurs secondary to reduced physical activity levels and

   subsequent physical deconditioning, with physical activity levels and V̇O2peak lower in fatigued

   versus non-fatigued participants and associated with fatigue severity in the present study,

   similar to previous findings 51-53. Although speculative, it has been suggested that exacerbated

   impairments in neuromuscular function in response to physical activity (considering the

   reduced exercise tolerance) could lead to increases in the perception of fatigue when

   performing daily activities21. Indeed, the greater impairment in MVC in the fatigued versus

   non-fatigued group occurred following 3 stages of incremental cycling exercise, and the

   intensity at this stage could correspond with low-intensity activities of daily living, such as

   walking or climbing stairs.                 In turn, the physiological disturbances (such as greater

   cardiorespiratory demand and metabolic perturbations) at relatively low intensities (relative to

   sex and age) would lead to an increased sense of effort 54 and fatigue when performing tasks in

   the presence of impaired neuromuscular function21. Accordingly, ‘primary’ factors

   contributing to CRF could precede and precipitate lower physical activity levels, inducing

   physical deconditioning and impairments in fatigability, further compounding fatigue as a

   ‘secondary’ factor. Further longitudinal research is warranted to assess the temporal

   associations between fatigue, physical inactivity, and fatigability in cancer survivors in order

   to determine the potential causal role of increased fatigability in persistent CRF 29.




   Anthropometrics and physical activity variables

   In addition to the increased fatigability in those with CRF, numerous other variables relevant

   to physical activity levels and anthropometrics, including V̇O2peak, body fat percentage, and

   LMI, were associated with fatigue severity. Regarding the anthropometric measures, the

   associations between body fat percentage and LMI with CRF suggest that these could provide

   useful measures to monitor potential risk factors for those with CRF, and that efforts to improve

   patient anthropometry could help to mitigate CRF in cancer survivors. Anthropometric

   measures could be integrated into the analysis from computerized tomography scans routinely

   used in people with cancer. Similar to the present findings, previous studies have shown that

   cardiorespiratory fitness 53 and anthropometric measures 22 23 are predictors of fatigue in cancer

   patients. While a causal role of these measures in CRF cannot be deduced from the present

   findings, the associations between physical activity levels, physical activity related measures,

   and CRF highlight the importance of performing regular physical activity in order to prevent

   cardiorespiratory deconditioning and deleterious changes which might contribute to CRF.

   Indeed, the Oncology Nursing Society ‘Putting Evidence into Practice’ tool on CRF proposes

   exercise and physical activity as a first-line intervention for CRF 55, and the American College

   of Sports Medicine guidelines similarly recommend regular structured physical activity to
                                 56
   reduce CRF severity                . This notwithstanding, it is estimated that only one-third of cancer
                                                                                                                           57-60
   survivors achieve physical activity guidelines outlined by the American Cancer Society                                          .

   Thus, further research is required to understand the barriers to physical activity in cancer

   survivors, and to tailor exercise interventions to meet individual needs regarding physical

   activity interests, preferences, tolerance, and physiological requirements 29 in order to improve

   adherence to exercise guidelines and potentially mitigate persistent CRF in cancer survivors.




   Inflammation

   The present results further demonstrated that TNF-α was higher in fatigued compared with

   non-fatigued participants and was associated with fatigue severity. Several studies have
                                                                                                        24-26
   similarly shown a link between TNF-α and CRF in cancer survivors                                             , indicative of

   heightened systemic inflammation in those with CRF. In turn, inflammation has emerged as a

   key biological pathway contributing towards CRF 61, with a strong mechanistic link between

   pro-inflammatory cytokines and fatigue. For example, neuro-immune interactions are known

   to occur through various pathways, including the transport of cytokines across the blood-brain

   barrier, activation via afferent vagal nerves, and through cytokine receptors located on brain

   vascular endothelial cells, which initiate cytokine production in the brain 62. Cytokine receptors

   are contained in diverse areas of the brain, with an abundance of receptors located on the

   hypothalamus. In turn, the hypothalamus has rich connections with the brain stem, frontal

   cortex, and limbic system, areas involved in emotion, behavior, motivation, memory, and

   motor dexterity. These neuro-immune interactions mediated through pro-inflammatory

   cytokines are implicated in ‘sickness behavior’, the coordinated set of adaptive behavioral

   changes that occur in infected individuals to promote survival, a major component of which is

   an increase in fatigue 63. Thus, the link between TNF-α and fatigue found in the present study

   corroborates numerous previous findings, and strong evidence points towards a cause-and-

   effect association between inflammation and fatigue in individuals with cancer.




   Psychosocial outcomes

   In addition to the numerous physiological correlates of CRF in the present study, psychosocial

   measures of depression, pain, and social support were also associated with fatigue severity.
                                                                                                     15 64 65
   Both depression and pain have been consistently associated with CRF                                          . However, the
                                                                                                           64
   nature and directionality of the depression-fatigue relationship is unclear                                  . For example,

   whether fatigue induces depression, or the reverse, is not understood. The consistent

   associations found between CRF and depressive symptoms could also arise due to

   measurement issues, particularly due to the overlap across dimensions of measurement tools

   used to assess both constructs. Moreover, there have been suggestions there could be common

   mechanisms between depression and fatigue 66, although differences in the temporal pattern of
                                                                                                                              67
   CRF and depressive symptomology have been noted in patients undergoing radiotherapy                                             ,

   had no effect on CRF 68. Future longitudinal studies should aim to determine the directionality

   of the relationship between fatigue and depression in order to assist in developing interventions

   to reduce these symptoms. Furthermore, social support has similarly been associated with

   findings to cancer survivors, highlighting the importance of social support in coping with

   fatigue, and the requirement for social support interventions in those who lack such support.




   Limitations

   While the present study provides important and novel results on the associates of CRF, the

   limitations should be acknowledged. Using the FACIT-F questionnaire, a score of ≤ 34 is

   recommended for diagnosis the of CRF 31, and this score was thus used to separate participants

   into the fatigued and non-fatigued group for the secondary between-group analysis in the

   present study. However, it is possible that this dichotomization of FACIT-F scores could have

   resulted in some participants being misclassified, though this is unlikely to influence our

   conclusions given that numerous measures which were different between groups were

   concurrently correlated with CRF severity. Furthermore, while the study uses what we believe

   Conclusions

   The present study is the first attempt to comprehensively assesse physiological, psychosocial,

   and disease-related variables potentially correlated with CRF severity in a large cohort of

   cancer survivors. The key and novel findings from the present study are that several exercise-

   related variables, including performance fatigability, V̇O2peak, LMI, body fat percentage, and

   self-reported physical activity levels, were different between fatigued and non-fatigued groups

   and predicted 35% of the variance in CRF severity. These results highlight the importance of

   performing regular physical activity in order to prevent physical deconditioning which might

   contribute to CRF. Taking this into account, exercise testing provides an important target for

   exercise interventions aimed at alleviating CRF, and exercise physiologists should be

   integrated in the management of CRF. In addition to physiological variables, a number of

   psychosocial measures, including depressive symptoms, pain, and social support, were

   associated with CRF severity. The numerous associates of CRF found in the present study

   highlight the multi-factorial nature of this symptom, and the requirement to use an

   individualised approach in the treatment and prevention of CRF. The results from this study

   can be used to guide future research when devising strategies to attenuate CRF in cancer

   survivors.
