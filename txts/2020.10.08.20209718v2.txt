     Abstract Dengue fever is an infectious disease caused by Flavivirus transmitted by Aedes mosquito. This disease
     predominantly occurs in the tropical and subtropical regions. With no specific treatment, the most effective way to
     prevent dengue is vector control. The dependence of Aedes mosquito population on meteorological variables make
     prediction of dengue infection possible using conventional statistical and epidemiologic models. However, with
     increasing average global temperature, the predictability of these models may be lessened employing the need for
     artificial neural network. This study uses artificial neural network to predict dengue incidence in the entire
     Philippines with humidity, rainfall, and temperature as independent variables. All generated predictive models have
     mean squared logarithmic error of less than 0.04.

1. Introduction
           Dengue fever is an infectious disease caused by Flavivirus transmitted by the vector mosquito Aedes. The
dengue virus has 4 serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) which mostly occur in the urban and sub-urban
areas in tropical and subtropical regions. It is estimated that 50 million people have dengue infection globally per annum.
In the Philippines, an estimated 170,000 cases occurred annually. Currently, there are no specific treatments for dengue
and the most effective way to prevent it is through vector control. [1-6]
           The 2 most important vectors for dengue transmission are: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The lifecycle of
these vectors is divided into egg, larva, pupa, and adult stages; which is heavily influenced by different meteorological,
geological, and anthropological variables. The typical adult mosquito lays egg just above the waterline of a stagnant
water. It will take 48 hours in warm, humid environment for the embryo to develop. Once developed, the eggs are tolerant
to desiccation up to more than a year.[1] The adult mosquito then typically emerges after 10 days. The adult female mates
and takes blood meal necessary for egg maturation. The blood meal biting activity takes place in the morning and
afternoon. [7, 8] However, blood meals also do occur at night in lighted rooms. [3]
           Temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity affects the transmission of dengue. [9] Annual rainfall of more than
200 cm provides conducive growth of Aedes population. [10] Mosquito population growth is more abundant in sea level
up to 500 meters above sea level, although they can thrive up to 1,200 meters. [11] Climate variability strongly influence
dengue epidemic. Maximal temperature of more than 32°C, maximal relative humidity of more than 95% influence the
incubation period, feeding frequency, and longevity of Aedes. [12] There is low mosquito mortality in temperature
between 15°C to 30°C. Pupae development occurs in less than 1 day in 32°C to 34°C but takes 4 days in 22°C. [13-17]
           With the dependence of Aedes mosquito population dynamics on weather variables; climate change,
undoubtedly, will have its impact on the spread of dengue infection. It is estimated that the average global temperature
will increase by 2°C to 4.5°C by year 2100. [18] There are many researches that predicted dengue infection using weather
variables. Different statistical models were employed such as: Poisson regression, autoregressive integrated moving
average (ARIMA), seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) [19, 22], negative binomial, quasi-
likelihood regression [19, 20], distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) [21]. There are also attempts to employ machine
learning techniques such as random forest and gradient boosting to make dengue infection predictions. [23-25] These
predictive models have varying degree of predictions on dengue incidence.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Setting
           The study was conducted in all 17 administrative regions in the Philippines: Region 1 to 12 (including 4-A and
4-B), Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), Cordillera Autonomous Region (CAR), and CARAGA. The
Philippines has two seasons: wet (June to October) and dry (November to May). However, there are 4 climate types in the
Philippines based on modified Coronas classification: Type I (dry from November to April, we from May to October),
Type II (seasonal rainfall from November to December), Type III (same as Type I but with maximum rainfall from May
to October), and Type IV (evenly distributed rainfall annually). [26]
2.2. Data Collection
           Data on dengue incidence is freely available in the Department of Health (DOH) website as PDF reports. These
dengue reports are sum of all case definition of a dengue case with or without the confirmation of polymerase chain
reaction. This is attributed to the limited resources available especially in remote and rural areas where dengue case
definition is based on signs and symptoms only. The meteorological data: humidity (as %), rainfall (as mm), temperature
(as °C) were requested from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration
(PAGASA) and were received as excel files. Missing dengue values were addressed by getting the average value from the
same region from different year period but of the same week time frame. Missing meteorological values were filled using
the average value from same weather station from different year period but of the same month time frame. These files
from DOH and PAGASA were encoded to CSV files for data analysis. Dengue data were reported on a weekly basis
from each administrative regions while the meteorological data were reported on a monthly basis from each weather
stations where most administrative regions have 2 to 3 weather stations. To reconcile these differences, the weekly tally
of dengue were summed up to reflect a month value while the meteorological values were averaged out from the weather
stations to reflect the regional value. The data on dengue and weather variables is from year 2013 to 2018.
2.3. Artificial Neural Network
           Data were analyzed in Python 3 using Jupyter Notebook as the interface while also employing several libraries
such as Numpy, Pandas, Keras, and Tensorflow. A training and test set were created for each region. The training set
consists of data from 2013 to 2017 and the test set contains data from 2018. An artificial neural network was created with
1 input layer, 6 hidden layers, and 1 output layer as shown in Figure 1. The input layer is composed of humidity, rainfall,
and temperature. The output layer is composed of dengue incidence.
Figure 1. Artificial neural network architecture.
           The artificial neural network uses rectified linear unit (ReLu) as the activation function and adaptive moment
estimation (Adam) as an optimiser. The artificial neural network was trained with batch size of 24 in 500 epochs for each
administrative region. The created model from the training set was used to predict the dengue values in the test set. The
prediction was evaluated using mean squared logarithmic error (MSLE).
3. Results
           Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of monthly humidity, rainfall, temperature, and dengue incidence for
each administrative region. ARMM has the lowest average dengue incidence of 157.26 while Region 4-A has the highest
at 2,616.97. NCR has the lowest average humidity of 75.24% while CAR has the highest at 87.25%. Region 12 has the
lowest average rainfall of 81.99 mm, while Region 7 has the highest at 1,130.61 mm. CAR has the lowest average
temperature of 19.47°C, while Region 11 has the highest at 28.7°C.

4. Discussion
           Although there is low MSLE in each administrative region, visual inspection of the actual and predicted dengue
incidence revealed that there are predictive models that are better than the other. It should be noted that the predictive
models are unique to each region since they are trained separately and have their own artificial neural network even
though they have the same network architecture. The administrative regions that have visually performed well are:
ARMM, CAR, Region 1, 3, 4-A, and 4-B. The predictive models also had inefficiencies in identifying the peak dengue
incidence which are evident in Region 2, 5, 10, and ARMM. The worst predictive models are in CARAGA, NCR, Region
2, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12.
           Predictions made by an artificial neural network is different from statistical or epidemiological modelling.
Artificial neural network utilizes collection of artificial neurons that take the weighted inputs, pass it through an
activation function, to produce an output. [27] In this study, there are 3 inputs: humidity, rainfall, and temperature; and
there is 1 output which is a single value of dengue incidence. The idea is, at any given values of the 3 input variables,
what will be the resulting dengue incidence. The rectified linear unit (ReLU) [28] is the activation function used to avoid
having negative values for the dengue incidence. These multiple units and layers of computation can make better
predictions.

          There are several limitations that was encountered in this study. The study encompasses entire administrative
region, which means micro-climate variability from each city or municipality can be a contributing factor to the dengue
incidence. The meteorological variables provided by PAGASA was limited to 3 (humidity, rainfall, temperature),
although the request includes flood occurrence and average sunlight. These 3 significant meteorological variables
appeared in the researches done in the Philippines. [23, 29] However, flood occurrence may help in dengue incidence
prediction because flushing can potentially reduce dengue incidence. [30] Average sunlight have inconclusive relationship
to dengue incidence using statistical model. [31] However, this might be proven otherwise if artificial neural network is
use.
          The impact of climate change can influence the transmission of dengue to other places other than the tropical
and subtropical regions. By the end of this century, dengue epidemic potential for Aedes aegypti could occur in 10
European cities (Madeira, Malaga, Athens, Rome, Nice, Paris, London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Stockholm) with continued
current rate of greenhouse gas emission. [32] The complexities of weather and climate influences on dengue transmission
are not easily modelled with statistical approach [33] which makes artificial neural network more helpful in predicting
dengue incidence more accurately.
5. Conclusion
          Close fidelity on the predicted and actual dengue incidence in some administrative region in the Philippines
prove that artificial neural network can be implemented for predicting dengue. Further work can be done in optimizing
the artificial neural network architecture: number of neurons, number of hidden layers, and additional input
meteorological variables (flood occurrence, average sunlight). It is recommended that future research be focused on the
city or municipal level of dengue cases and weather variables measurement to be able to create a local public health
policy.
