                       COVID-19 superspreading in cities versus the countryside

                                                           (Dated: October 13, 2020)
                 So far, the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by an initial rapid rise in new cases
              followed by a peak and a more erratic behaviour that varies between regions. This is not easy to
              reproduce with traditional SIR models, which predict a more symmetric epidemic. Here, we argue
              that superspreaders and population heterogeneity are the core factors explaining this discrepancy.
              We do so through an agent-based lattice model of a disease spreading in a heterogeneous population.
              We predict that an epidemic driven by superspreaders will spread rapidly in cities, but not in the
              countryside where the sparse population limits the maximal number of secondary infections. This
              suggests that mitigation strategies should include restrictions on venues where people meet a large
              number of strangers. Furthermore, mitigating the epidemic in cities and in the countryside may
              require different levels of restrictions.

infects practically all of them, but there is a lower cap on the number of secondary infections.

        Different distribution of infectious periods
        In order to take into account that the duration of illness caused by COVID-19 does not actually follow
        a neat exponential distribution, we have here considered the case where the duration of infection is
        gamma distributed as well, though with a dispersion factor greater than one (k ≈ 4). We repeat the
        central figures 3 and 5 from the main article in order to see if a different distribution of infectious
        period durations changes our results. The gamma distribution should give fewer people with a very
        short disease duration, though both distributions have a relatively long tail. The mean duration of
        infectiousness is the same as in the main article (10 days). An important complication, that individuals
        with a long period of illness are likely to be hospitalised or otherwise isolated for part of it and thus
        less infectious, has not been accounted for here.
            We find that, while the different distribution of infectious periods does lower the percolation thresh-
        hold slightly and also diminishes the population density dependence of the epidemic, it does not fun-
        damentally change our conclusions.

        Figure 2: A comparison of the effect of population density on an epidemic that is not overdispersed
        (top) and an overdispersed epidemic (bottom). As above, the duration of illness is gamma distributed.
        The effect of density is somewhat reduced in the overdispersed case, but still noticeably greater than
        the non-overdispersed case. The smaller number of people with very short disease durations using this
        distribution seemingly also helps the epidemic spread more effectively.

        Fractal city distribution
        The random distribution of cities used in fig. 6 of the main article is not entirely realistic. Rather,
        there is evidence suggesting that real geographical distribution of cities follows a fractal pattern [1,2].
        We therefore repeat the figure here with a (partially) fractal distribution of cities. The results of this
        simulation are fairly similar to the random city distribution.

        Figure 3: A simulation where, instead of a random distribution, the cities are laid out in a fractal
        pattern. We see that this makes little difference from the random distribution shown in the main
        article. The lower panel shows epidemic trajectories from three test runs.
