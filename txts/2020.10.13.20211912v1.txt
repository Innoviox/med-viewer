    Abstract
    Pernicious anemia is a rare condition characterized by vitamin B12 deficiency anemia due to lack
    of intrinsic factor, often caused by autoimmune gastritis. Patients with pernicious anemia have a
    higher incidence of other autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes, vitiligo and autoimmune
    thyroid issues. Therefore, the disease has a clear autoimmune basis, although the genetic
    susceptibility factors have thus far remained poorly studied. We conducted a genome-wide
    association study meta-analysis in 2,166 cases and 659,516 European controls from population-
    based biobanks and identified genome-wide significant signals in or near the PTPN22
    (rs6679677, p=1.91 x 10-24, OR=1.63), PNPT1 (rs12616502, p=3.14 x 10 -8, OR=1.70), HLA-DQB1
    (rs28414666, p=1.40 x 10 -16, OR=1.38), IL2RA (rs2476491, p=1.90 x 10 -8, OR=1.22) and AIRE
    (rs74203920, p=2.33 x 10 -9, OR=1.83) genes, thus providing the first robust associations between
    pernicious anemia and genetic risk factors. We further mapped the susceptibility in the HLA region
    to the HLA-DR15 haplotype. Analysis of associated diagnoses and disease trajectories confirm
    the association between pernicious anemia and thyroid issues, vitiligo, gastritis, stomach cancer,
    osteoporosis and other diagnoses.
    Main text
    B12 deficiency anemia due to intrinsic factor deficiency, also known as pernicious anemia, is
    characterized by impaired B12 uptake caused by lack of intrinsic factor, a substance produced by
    epithelial cells of the stomach lining. Intrinsic factor normally binds B12 and facilitates absorption
    in the intestinal tract. Pernicious anemia is often caused by autoimmune damage to the stomach
    lining (autoimmune gastritis) in which case the gastric epithelial lining is damaged or destroyed1.
    The prevalence of pernicious anemia is around 0.1% in populations of European ancestry;
    however, it is more common in older people (~2% in >60-year-olds), and believed to be less
    prevalent in Asian populations2. Symptoms of pernicious anemia range from fatigue to

    megaloblastic anemia and neurological abnormalities (peripheral numbness, paresthesia, ataxia)
    in more serious cases3.
              Pernicious anemia is a complex disease with familial clustering, with a clear autoimmune
    basis and higher incidence of other autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid
    conditions4, vitiligo5, type 1 diabetes6 in both patients with pernicious anemia and their relatives 7.
    Although studies focusing on HLA serotypes have been conducted for pernicious anemia, the
    results have been conflicting7 and currently there is no clear consensus on the HLA alleles or
    other genetic risk factors predisposing to pernicious anemia.
              We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of vitamin B12 deficiency due
    to lack of intrinsic factor to evaluate the contribution of genetic variation to the etiology of this
    disease in a combined dataset of 2,166 cases and 659,516 controls from three large population
    based biobanks - Estonian Biobank (EstBB)8, UK Biobank (UKBB)9, and FinnGen study. In the
    EstBB, individuals with pernicious anemia were identified using the ICD-10 code D51.0, resulting
    in 378 cases and 138,207 controls for analysis. Association testing was carried out with SAIGE
    0.38 software10, adjusting for sex, year of birth and 10 PCs. Analysis in the EstBB was carried out
    under ethical approval 1.1-12/624 from the Estonian Committee on Bioethics and Human
    Research and data release N05 from the EstBB. GWAS summary statistics for the UKBB analysis
    including       White         British       participants      were     downloaded             from   the   UKBB        PheWeb
    (http://pheweb.sph.umich.edu/SAIGE-UKB/about). Similarly, cases had been identified using the
    ICD-10 code D51.0 (754 cases, 390026 controls) and SAIGE had been used for association
    testing, adjusting for sex, birth year and the first 4 PCs. Summary statistics for FinnGen study
    were          obtained             from         the         publicly       available            R3     release         PheWeb
    (https://www.finngen.fi/en/access_results). In the FinnGen study, we used the endpoint ‘Vitamin
    B12 deficiency anemia’, which included all the subcodes in the ICD10 D51 diagnosis group (1,034
    cases, 131,283 controls). Similarly to other cohorts, SAIGE had been used for association testing,
    adjusting for sex, age, 10 PCs and genotyping batch. For meta-analysis, we used fixed-effects
    meta-analysis implemented in GWAMA11. Additional details available in Methods section.
              In our GWAS meta-analysis we identify five genome-wide significant (p<5 × 10-8)
    associations (Table 1, Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1) on 1p13.2 (lead signal rs6679677,
    p=1.91 × 10-24), 2p16.1 (rs12616502, p=3.14 × 10-8), 6p21.32 (rs28414666, p=1.40 × 10-16),
    10p15.1 (rs2476491, p=1.90 × 10-8), and 21q22.3 (rs74203920, p=2.33 × 10-9), with similar effect
    estimates (effect heterogeneity was measured using Cochran’s test, p-values ranging from 0.05
    to 0.83) in all analyzed cohorts (Figure 1), except for the lead variant on chromosome 2, which is
    absent in the Finnish data.

              The lead SNP on chr1, rs6679677, is in high LD (r 2=0.96) with a non-synonymous variant
    in exon 12 of the PTPN22 gene (rs2476601, p=2.82 × 10-24). PTPN22 is a known immune
    regulator gene and this particular variant has been associated with several autoimmune diseases,
    including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, vitiligo,
    autoimmune thyroid conditions, type 1 diabetes and others (Supplementary Table 1 and 3,
    Supplementary Figure 2).
              On chromosome 2, the lead signal rs12616502 is in high LD with exonic non-synonymous
    variants in CCDC104 (r2=0.94, rs1045920) and PNPT1 (r2=0.94, rs7594497), and this region has
    been previously associated with both vitiligo, hypothyroidism and myelodysplastic syndrome
    (Supplementary Tables 1 and 3, Supplementary Figure 2). Colocalization analysis demonstrated
    that pernicious anemia has a common causal variant with the expression of PTPN1 in thyroid
    tissue in GTEx v8 dataset (Figure 2, Supplementary Table 2). PTPN1 is further supported as a
    candidate          causal        gene        in    this     locus      by     data      from        mouse   knockouts,           as
    Pnpt1tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi/Pnpt1+ mice exhibit increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) together
    with increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 12. Increased red blood cell MCV is a
    common feature in macrocytic anemias, both megaloblastic (caused by B12 deficiency and
    pernicious anemia) and nonmegaloblastic (caused by diseases such as myelodysplastic
    syndrome and hypothyroidism)13.

              The third signal on chromosome 6 is located in the HLA region, a common hub for
    autoimmune condition associations, downstream HLA-DQB1. To further clarify the association
    signal in the HLA region, we used data on a total of 249 imputed HLA alleles at four-digit level
    available for 183 cases and 67,505 controls in the EstBB. Three tested alleles passed the
    Bonferroni corrected threshold of association (0.05/249=2 × 10-4), including HLA-DRB1*15:01
    (p=1.3 × 10-6), HLA-DQB1*06:02 (p=1.3 × 10-6) and HLA-DQA1*01:02 (p=2.8 × 10-5). The
    DRB1*15:01-DQB1*06:02-DQA1*01:02 combination forms the HLA-DR15 haplotype, which is a
    reported risk factor for multiple sclerosis14. HLA-DR15 belongs under the HLA-DR2 group, which
    has been associated with pernicious anemia in a 1981 study 15.

              On chromosome 10, the sentinel variant rs2476491 is intronic to IL2RA. IL2RA encodes
    the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain, thus being involved in regulating regulatory T-cells and
    immune tolerance, as regulatory T cells suppress autoreactive T-cells. Accordingly, this locus has
    previously been associated with multiple sclerosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, vitiligo and
    hypothyroidism (Supplementary Table 1).
              Finally, the association on chromosome 21, rs74203920, is a missense variant in the AIRE
    gene, a known autoimmune regulator. Interestingly, mutations in AIRE are a known cause of
    autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1 (APS-1), which is a rare autosomal recessive
    syndrome, that sometimes includes pernicious anemia among other components16.
              We used the individual level data in EstBB to evaluate the association between pernicious
    anemia and other diseases (defined by ICD-10 codes). According to our analysis, individuals with
    pernicious anemia have more diagnoses of other anemias and vitamin deficiencies (Figure 3,
    Supplementary Table 4), thyroid problems (thyroiditis and hypothyroidism), gastrointestinal tract
    diagnoses (gastritis, malignant neoplasm of stomach, intestinal malabsorption, irritable bowel
    syndrome), but also of vitiligo, dermatitis, osteoporosis and spontaneous abortion. Evaluation of
    disease timeline shows that while there is considerable individual variation, on average, thyroid
    issues (ICD10 E03 other hypothyroidism and E06 thyroiditis, Figure 3), intestinal problems (K12
    stomatitis, K29 gastritis and K58 irritable bowel syndrome), spontaneous abortion (O03),
    depression (F32) and vitiligo (L80) are diagnosed before pernicious anemia, while nutritional
    deficiencies are diagnosed after (D52 folate deficiency, E53 deficiency of other B vitamins, E55
    vitamin D deficiency, E61 deficiency of other nutrient elements). Majority of these diagnoses
    reflect the etiology of pernicious anemia (gastritis) or symptoms (skin problems, syncope and
    collapse, depression, stomatitis), known comorbidities (vitiligo, thyroid issues4,5), or diseases
    where pernicious anemia is a known risk factor (such as osteoporosis17 and stomach cancer18).
    The association with spontaneous abortion is interesting, as although there is some evidence B12
    deficiency and pernicious anemia could cause recurrent miscarriage 19–21, the data is scarce and
    the link with spontaneous miscarriage has not been explored in depth.

              This GWAS meta-analysis focused on individuals with pernicious anemia identified from
    population-based biobanks, thus more detailed analysis on the effect these genetic risk factors
    have on disease severity or subphenotypes is unfortunately not possible. Although the used
    summary statistics for FinnGen cohort are for a broader vitamin B12 deficiency phenotype
    definition compared toother two cohorts, we see no significant differences in effect estimates for
    the reported lead variants. The analyses included participants of European ancestry, however,
    analyses in other populations are warranted, since the prevalence of pernicious anemia differs
    depending on racial background, being more common in people with African or European
    ancestry, especially from Scandinavia and UK 2. The analysis of associated phenotypes could
    potentially provide clinically useful insights into pernicious anemia disease trajectories and o ffer
    information for patient management; however, at the moment it only includes participants of the
    EstBB, with limited follow-up time, therefore further studies are needed.
              In summary, our analysis of 2,166 cases and 659,516 controls identifies robust risk loci
    for pernicious anemia in or near candidate genes with a known role in autoimmune conditions
    (PTPN22, HLA, IL2RA, AIRE). We further narrow the signal in the HLA region to the HLA-DR15
    haplotype and propose PNPT1 as the most likely causal gene in the 2p16.1 locus. The
    associations between the identified loci and other autoimmune conditions, such as type 1
    diabetes, vitiligo, and autoimmune thyroid conditions help to clarify the link between pernicious
    anemia and its common comorbidities. Analysis of associated diagnoses and disease trajectories
    confirm the association between pernicious anemia and thyroid issues, vitiligo, gastritis, stomach
    cancer, osteoporosis and other diagnoses, but also between pernicious anemia and spontaneous
    abortion.
    Methods
    Cohorts
    Estonian Biobank
    The Estonian Biobank is a population-based biobank with over 200,000 participants. The 150K
    data freeze was used for the analyses described in this paper. All biobank participants have
    signed a broad informed consent form. Individuals with pernicious anemia were identified using
    the ICD-10 code D51.0, and all biobank participants who did not have this diagnosis were
    considered as controls. Information on ICD codes is obtained via regular linking with the national
    Health Insurance Fund and other relevant databases8.

              All EstBB participants have been genotyped at the Core Genotyping Lab of the Institute
    of Genomics, University of Tartu, using Illumina GSAv1.0, GSAv2.0, and GSAv2.0_EST arrays.
    Samples were genotyped and PLINK format files were created using Illumina GenomeStudio
    v2.0.4. Individuals were excluded from the analysis if their call-rate was < 95% or if sex defined
    based on heterozygosity of X chromosome did not match sex in phenotype data. Before
    imputation, variants were filtered by call-rate < 95%, HWE p-value < 1e-4 (autosomal variants
    only), and minor allele frequency < 1%. Variant positions were updated to b37 and all variants
    were changed to be from TOP strand using GSAMD-24v1-0_20011747_A1-b37.strand.RefAlt.zip
    files from https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~wrayner/strand/ webpage. Prephasing was done using
    Eagle v2.3 software22 (number of conditioning haplotypes Eagle2 uses when phasing each
    sample was set to: --Kpbwt=20000) and imputation was done using Beagle v.28Sep18.793 23 with
    effective population size ne=20,000. Population specific imputation reference of 2297 WGS
    samples was used.
    Association analysis was carried out using SAIGE (v0.38) 10 software implementing mixed logistic
    regression model with LOCO option, using sex, year of birth and 10 PCs as covariates in step I.
    UK Biobank
    The UK Biobank (UKBB) is a prospective cohort of 502,637 individuals aged 37-73 recruited in
    2006-2010 from across the UK, who completed detailed questionnaires regarding socio-
    demographic and lifestyle characteristics and their medical history and had a clinical assessment.
    Additional information about medical conditions (both existing at baseline and occurring during
    follow-up) has been obtained through linking with hospital admission and mortality data. Full
    details of the study have been reported in Sudlow et al9. Publicly available GWAS summary
    statistics downloaded from the UKBB PheWeb [http://pheweb.sph.umich.edu/SAIGE-UKB/about]
    were used for the analysis. Briefly, the PheWeb includes GWAS summary statistics for ICD code-
    based traits extracted from electronic health records. Phenotypes have been classified into 1,403
    broad PheWAS codes, including pernicious anemia (PheCode 281.11), defined using the ICD-10
    code D51.0 and excluding other anemias under the PheCodes 280-285.99. Genetic analyses
    have been carried out using SAIGE10.
    FinnGen
    FinnGen is a public-private partnership project combining data from Finnish biobanks and
    electronic health records from different registries. After a one-year embargo, the FinnGen

    summary stats are available for download. In this study, we used the results from the FinnGen
    release R3, which includes data from 135,638 individuals and more than 1,800 disease endpoints.
    FinnGen individuals have been genotyped with Illumina and Affymetrix arrays and imputed to the
    population-specific SISu v3 importation reference panel. Genetic association testing has been
    carried out with SAIGE10. The FinnGen disease endpoint “Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia”
    included all individuals with the ICD10 D51 diagnosis as cases. For more information on genotype
    data,          disease               endpoints              and        GWAS               analyses,        please              see
    https://finngen.gitbook.io/documentation/.
    GWAS meta-analysis
    We extracted all genetic variants with a rs-number from the summary statistics of the three
    participating cohorts and conducted an inverse of variance weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis
    without genomic control using GWAMA11. A total of 30,907,385 variants were included in the
    meta-analysis. Genome-wide significance was set to p < 5 × 10-8.
    HLA allele imputation in the EstBB
    Imputation of HLA alleles from SNP data was carried out at the Broad Institute using the
    SNP2HLA tool24.
    Colocalization
    We conducted colocalization analyses to detect shared causal variants between pernicious
    anemia and gene expression using COLOC (v.3.2.1) R package 25 and GWAS meta-analysis
    summary statistics. We set the prior probabilities to p 1=1 × 10-4, p2=1 × 10-4, p12=5 × 10-6 as
    suggested by Wallace (2020)26 and used the COLOC version which takes regression coefficients
    and their variance into account.
    In the analysis we compared our significant GWAS loci to all eQTL Catalogue
    (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl/) RNA-seq datasets (excluding Lepik et al. 2017 27 due to sample
    overlap) containing QTLs for gene expression, exon expression, transcript usage and txrevise
    event usage; eQTL Catalogue microarray datasets containing QTLs for gene expression
    (excluding Kasela et al 2017 28); and GTEx v8 datasets containing QTLs for gene expression (see
    Methods: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl/Methods/).
              We lifted the GWAS summary statistics over to hg38 build to match the eQTL Catalogue.
    For each genome-wide significant (p<5 × 10-8) GWAS locus we extracted the 1Mbp radius of its
    top hit from QTL datasets and ran the colocalization analysis for those eQTL Catalogue traits that

    had at least one cis-QTL within this region with p< 1 × 10-6. We considered two signals to
    colocalize if the posterior probability for a shared causal variant was 0.8 or higher. All results with
    a PP4 > 0.8 can be found in Supplementary Table 2.
              Results were visualized with the LocusCompareR library30.
    Look-up of phenome-wide associations in GWAS catalog and with PhenoScanner v2
    FUMA v1.3.6a29 was used to compare the genome-wide significant lead signals and markers in
    high LD with these markers against the results in the GWAS catalogue. The results of this look-
    up are presented in Supplementary Table 1.
              PhenoScanner v231,32 was used for look-up of phenotype associations for the GWAS lead
    variants in previous GWAS studies. PhenoScanner query was done using the rsid-s of GWAS
    lead               variants                  and             the            phenoscanner                   R           package
    (https://github.com/phenoscanner/phenoscanner). Query results were filtered to keep one
    association per variant per trait, keeping studies from newer or larger studies. Descriptions of
    Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) terms and classification of EFO broad categories were
    obtained from the GWAS Catalog. Missing categories were added by manually searching the
    EMBL-EBI EFO webpage (www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/). For visualization of PhenoScanner results, parent
    categories with fewer results were grouped into larger categories and a heatmap was created
    using       the        pheatmap             library      in    R      3.6.1.       and        a      modified   script        from
    (https://github.com/LappalainenLab/spiromics-covid19-
    eqtl/blob/master/eqtl/summary_phenoscanner_lookup.Rmd). The results of this look-up are
    presented in Supplementary Table 3.
    Mouse phenotypes
    We used the Mouse Genome Database12 ( http://www.informatics.jax.org) to evaluate the
    PNPT1 effect on phenotype in mouse models.
    Analysis of associated phenotypes in EstBB
    Using the individual level data in the EstBB, we conducted an analysis to find ICD10 diagnosis
    codes associated with the D51.0 diagnosis. We tested the association between pernicious anemia
    status (defined as ICD10 D51.0) and other ICD10 codes using logistic regression and adjusting
    for sex, age and 10 PCs. Bonferroni correction was applied to select statistically significant
    associations (Number of tested ICD main codes – 1,944, corrected p-value threshold – 2.5 × 10-

      ). Results were visualised using the PheWas library (https://github.com/PheWAS/PheWAS). All
    analyses were carried out in R 3.6.1. Diagnosis timeline of pernicious anemia and significantly
    associated diagnoses was evaluated by calculating the time interval (in years) between the first
    date of pernicious anemia diagnosis (D51.0) and first date of associated disease for each
    individual. Results were visualized by plotting the means and standard deviations of calculated
    intervals using R 3.6.1. The results of this analysis are presented in Supplementary Table 4.
