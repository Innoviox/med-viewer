   Abstract
   Background: Up to 80% of active SARS-CoV-2 infections are proposed to be asymptomatic based on
   cross-sectional studies. However, accurate estimates of the asymptomatic proportion require systematic
   detection and follow-up to differentiate between truly asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. We
   conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis of the asymptomatic proportion of PCR-confirmed SARS-
   CoV-2 infections based on methodologically-appropriate studies in community settings.
   Methods: We searched Medline and EMBASE for peer-reviewed articles, and BioRxiv and MedRxiv for
   pre-prints published before 25/08/2020. We included studies based in community settings that involved
   systematic PCR testing on participants and follow-up symptom monitoring regardless of symptom status.
   We extracted data on study characteristics, frequencies of PCR-confirmed infections by symptom status,
   and (if available) cycle threshold/genome copy number values and/or duration of viral shedding by
   symptom status, and age of asymptomatic versus (pre)symptomatic cases. We computed estimates of
   the asymptomatic proportion and 95% confidence intervals for each study and overall using random effect
   meta-analysis.
   Findings: We screened 1138 studies and included 21. The pooled asymptomatic proportion of SARS-
   CoV-2 infections was 23% (95% CI 16%-30%). When stratified by testing context, the asymptomatic
   proportion ranged from 6% (95% CI 0-17%) for household contacts to 47% (95% CI 21-75%) for non-
   outbreak point prevalence surveys with follow-up symptom monitoring. Estimates of viral load and
   duration of viral shedding appeared to be similar for asymptomatic and symptomatic cases based on
   available data, though detailed reporting of viral load and natural history of viral shedding by symptom
   status were limited. Evidence into the relationship between age and symptom status was inconclusive.
   Conclusion: Asymptomatic viral shedding comprises a substantial minority of SARS-CoV-2 infections
   when estimated using methodologically-appropriate studies. Further investigation into variation in the
   asymptomatic proportion by testing context, the degree and duration of infectiousness for asymptomatic
   infections, and demographic predictors of symptom status are warranted.

   Background
   Reports of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and potential transmission1,2,3 have generated concern
   regarding the implications of undetected asymptomatic transmission on the effectiveness of public health
   interventions in the current COVID-19 pandemic4. However, estimating the proportion of asymptomatic
   SARS-CoV-2 infections with viral shedding is challenging as the majority of testing is carried out on
   symptomatic individuals5. Furthermore, longitudinal designs that include symptom follow-up are required
   to differentiate truly asymptomatic cases, i.e. those that never develop symptoms during infection, from
   pre-symptomatic cases, i.e. those that shed virus and therefore test positive prior to symptom onset (see
   Figure 1). While asymptomatic viral shedding has been suggested to comprise up to ~80% of SARS-CoV-
   2 infections 6,7,8, data informing these figures are largely confined to cross-sectional reports that cannot
   distinguish truly asymptomatic cases from those who are pre-symptomatic at the point of testing (see
   Figure 1). Interchangeable use of these concepts, i.e. asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic, precludes
   accurate estimation of the asymptomatic proportion of potentially infectious SARS-CoV-2 cases.
   Detectible SARS-CoV-2 shedding based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   testing cannot conclusively establish infectiousness in the absence of viral culture 9,10. However, PCR
   cycle threshold values provide an informative estimate of viral load and, by extension, probable
   infectiousness 9; consequently, PCR-confirmed infection can provide a useful and accessible indicator of
   potentially infectious cases, including those without symptoms, for epidemiological modelling.
   Differences in demographic characteristics of asymptomatic versus symptomatic individuals are also
   poorly understood. Age is an important risk factor for COVID-19 severity, with greater risk of poor
   prognostic outcomes including mortality in older adults 11,12. Consequently, asymptomatic infection may be
   less common with increasing age. Understanding the relationship between age and symptom status has
   important implications for public health interventions.
   Given the widespread discussion and potential implications of asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-
   2, we aimed to rapidly synthesize studies to estimate the asymptomatic proportion of PCR-confirmed
   cases in community settings (primary outcome). We also aimed to synthesize available data from these
   studies regarding viral load and duration of viral shedding in asymptomatic community cases compared to
   pre-symptomatic cases or those symptomatic from baseline (secondary outcome), and the relationship
   between symptom status and age (secondary outcome). We limited the review to include studies from
   community settings rather than hospitals and other medical facilities to prevent selection bias towards
   symptomatic cases. Only studies reporting PCR-confirmed cases rather than exclusive serological studies
   were included to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with viral shedding. The
   review was not extended to estimate the overall asymptomatic proportion including non-shedding
   serological cases due to the limited number of serological studies, varying interpretation, and ongoing
   development of valid serological assays for SARS-CoV-2.

   Methodology
   This review was reported in line with the PRISMA guidelines 13. A protocol was not registered due to its
   status as a rapid review.
   Search Strategy
   We used Ovid to search the Medline and EMBASE databases of peer-reviewed literature (2019- May 05
   2020 and search repeated to include period of May 06 2020 to June 10 2020, and subsequently to
   include June 11 2020 to August 25 2020) using the following search terms for titles and abstracts:
   (Coronavirus* OR Covid-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR nCoV) AND (asymptomatic) AND (polymerase chain
   reaction OR PCR OR laboratory-confirmed OR confirmed). We also searched BioRxiv and MedRxiv for
   titles and abstracts of pre-print manuscripts using the terms “Covid-19” + “asymptomatic”. We hand-
   searched the reference lists of all included studies to identify any additional relevant literature.
   Selection Criteria
   We included studies that met all of the following criteria: 1) human study; AND 2) presented original
   research or public health COVID-19 surveillance data; AND 3) available in English; AND 4) presented data
   on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 cases; AND 5) presented data on PCR testing
   of exposed or potentially exposed individuals regardless of symptom status (to avoid bias towards
   symptomatic cases); AND 6) had systematic follow-up at ≥ 1 time-point and reporting of symptom status
   among PCR confirmed cases (to differentiate pre-clinical shedding from truly asymptomatic cases); AND
   7) presented data from a community setting (i.e. community and home contact tracing, population
   screening, traveller screening, community institutional settings such as care homes, schools, or workplaces,
   occupational exposure including healthcare workers). Studies were excluded if they met any of the following
   criteria: 1) studies or case series with <5 positive cases and/or <20 total cases (small sample size) due to
   likely low generalisability of asymptomatic proportions; OR 2) not possible to consistently ascertain the
   symptomatic status of participants across follow-up; OR 3) inadequate detail about testing strategy (i.e. not
   possible to discern if all cases were tested systematically); OR 4) recruitment/reporting of patients from
   acute healthcare settings (e.g. hospitals, medical facilities) due to selection bias towards symptomatic
   cases.
   Data Extraction and Analysis
   One researcher performed the search and deduplication using Ovid, screened and selected studies, and
   extracted study details. Two researchers extracted primary outcome data independently and resolved any
   disagreement by consensus. We extracted the following variables of interest to assess the primary and
   secondary outcomes and the characteristics and quality of included studies: author names, year of
   publication, publication type (peer-reviewed article or pre-print), study design, study setting, study country
   of location, participant age (mean, median, or range as available), participant sex distribution, symptoms
   comprising symptomatic case definition, duration of symptom history at PCR-confirmation, duration of
   follow-up symptom monitoring, testing criteria, sample size, number of participants who underwent PCR
   testing, number of PCR-confirmed cases, number of confirmed cases who remained asymptomatic
   throughout follow-up, and cycle threshold or genome copy number values, viral culture results, duration of

   viral shedding for asymptomatic and pre-/symptomatic cases, and any available data regarding age or age
   distribution of asymptomatic versus (pre)symptomatic cases if reported.
   We performed random-effects meta-analysis using the metaprop programme14 in Stata Version 15 to
   compute the study-specific and pooled asymptomatic proportion - the primary outcome of this review - with
   its 95% confidence intervals (Wilson score method) and 95% prediction intervals 15, applying the Freeman-
   Tukey transformation. We decided a-priori to use a random effects model to address heterogeneity. The
   asymptomatic proportion is given as the number of consistently asymptomatic confirmed cases divided by
   the total number of PCR-confirmed cases who received follow-up (Figure 2). It is important to note that the
   term asymptomatic proportion is sometimes used to alternatively refer to the asymptomatic proportion of all
   infections including those that do not shed virus and would not be PCR-confirmed (see Figure 2). To
   account for potential exposure-driven heterogeneity in asymptomatic proportion, we present findings
   stratified by testing context as well as overall. Testing context was subdivided into studies comprising
   exclusive household contacts of an index case, studies comprising contacts from other settings or those
   (potentially) exposed to an outbreak (including travellers returning from high-prevalence regions), and point
   prevalence surveys not specifically linked to an outbreak that had follow-up symptom monitoring.
   We reported available findings regarding the viral load, duration of viral shedding, and age of asymptomatic
   and (pre)symptomatic cases, but did not conduct meta-analysis due to sparse reporting and inconsistencies
   in data presented.
   Risk of Bias Assessment
   We assessed risk of bias based using criteria relevant to the topic of this review adapted from the Joanna
   Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for prevalence studies16 (Table 1). Two researchers independently
   assessed the risk of bias for each included study and resolved any disagreement by consensus. Bias was
   assessed according to criteria described in Table 1, with studies graded as very low risk of bias if they were
   unlikely to have been affected by bias on any of the criteria, low if one criterion may have been affected,
   moderate if two may have been affected, and high if all three may have been affected. Risk of publication
   bias across included studies was assessed using a funnel plot and Egger’s test.
   Results
   Records Identified
   Figure 3 presents an adapted PRISMA flow diagram13 of the study selection procedure. The search
   yielded 1077 published articles indexed on OVID and 473 pre-prints. Following deduplication, we
   screened the titles and abstracts of 1138 published articles and pre-prints, of which we assessed the 133
   full texts – including a relevant text identified through hand-search of the literature – and included 21 in
   the present review 17-37. Three of the 21 included studies comprised household contacts of confirmed
   cases26,28,29. A further 3 included studies were point prevalence surveys with symptom monitoring follow-
   up34,35,36, one of which was conducted in a general population sample 36 and the remaining two in nursing

   home samples34,35. The remaining 15 studies involved participants with other epidemiological links to
   confirmed or suspected cases/outbreaks17,18,19,20,21,22, 23,24,25,27,30,31,32,33, including 5 studies based in
   nursing homes 18,19,24,32,37, and 1 study of healthcare workers with occupational exposure to confirmed
   cases30. The healthcare worker study was included as it comprised whole-facility testing following
   occupational exposure in healthcare workers rather than patients presenting to healthcare settings due to
   symptoms (see inclusion criteria). Studies were conducted across the following range of countries in Asia,
   Europe, and North America: China22,25,26,27,29, USA18,19,28,32,36, UK24,35,37, South Korea17, France20,
   Vietnam21, Brunei23, Italy30, Japan31, Hong Kong33, and Ireland34. Risk of bias was rated as very low for 2
   studies 30,33, low for 15 studies17-20,22,23,25-29,32,34-36, and moderate for 4 studies21,24,31,37.
   Asymptomatic Proportion of PCR-Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Community Settings
   Estimates of the asymptomatic proportion of PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 infections for included studies
   ranged from 0% (95% CI 0-0.8%; Yousaf et al., 202028) to 91% (95% CI 73%-98%; Starling et al.,
   202035). Table 2 reports all asymptomatic proportions with 95% confidence intervals for as well as details
   of included studies. Based on random-effects meta-analysis (Figure 4), the pooled estimate for the
   asymptomatic proportion was 23% (95% CI 16%-30%; 95% prediction interval 0.01-57%). There was high
   heterogeneity: Q(20)= 253.06, p<.001, τ2= 0.11, I2= 92.10%. Heterogeneity appeared to be partly
   influenced by testing context (test for subgroup heterogeneity: Q(2) = 10.49, p=0.01), but remained
   substantial within these subgroups. Household contact studies demonstrated the lowest asymptomatic
   proportion estimate of 6% (95% CI 0-17%; heterogeneity Q(2)= 12.09, p<.001 τ2= 0.07, I2= 83.46%),
   rising to 23% (95% CI 14-32%; Q(14)= 139.86, p<.001 τ2= 0.12, I2= 89.99%) for studies comprising
   participants with other epidemiological links to SARS-CoV-2 cases or outbreaks, and 47% (95% CI 21-
   75%; Q(2)= 47.16, p<.001 τ2= 0.23, I2= 95.76%) for point prevalence surveys with symptom follow-up
   and without direct links to outbreaks/cases. Data were limited for studies exclusively involving household
   contacts or point prevalence surveys (both n=3 studies).
   The funnel plot (Figure 5) and Egger’s test did not indicate publication bias across studies included in the
   meta-analysis: t=0.23, p=0.82, 95% CI: -0.97, 1.20.
   Viral Load and Duration of Viral Shedding
   Eight of the twenty-one included studies reported data regarding the CT values/viral load and/or duration
   of viral shedding for asymptomatic cases versus pre-symptomatic cases and/or those symptomatic from
   baseline. Differences in methodology and reporting precluded meta-analysis.
   Five studies reported CT values and/or genome copy number by symptom status. One of these studies,
   Hung et al. (2020)33, found lower median baseline genome copy number in asymptomatic (3.86 log10
   copies/mL) than symptomatic participants (7.62 log10 copies/mL). The remaining four studies all reported
   similar CT values for asymptomatic and symptomatic participants. Arons et al. (2020)18 reported similar

   baseline median cycle threshold values (CT) for asymptomatic (CT =25.5), pre-symptomatic (CT=23.1),
   and symptomatic (CT=24.5) cases. Infectious virus was isolated by viral culture from 33% (1/3) of
   available asymptomatic case specimens, 70.8% (17/24) of pre-symptomatic case specimens, and 65.0%
   (16/20) for symptomatic case specimens18. Chamie et al. (2020)36 also found that median CT values
   across samples were not significantly different between asymptomatic (CT=24, IQR: 19-26) and
   symptomatic individuals (CT=24, IQR: 19-25). Pre-symptomatic individuals appeared to have higher
   median CT values if seronegative and similar values if seropositive, but numerical detail was not reported
   overall for this group. Ladhani et al. (2020)37 also found no significant difference in baseline CT values
   between asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and post-symptomatic (i.e. reported symptoms in
   the two weeks prior to positive PCR result) participants; exact values were not provided. Chau et al.
   (2020)21 also reported similar baseline cycle threshold values for asymptomatic and symptomatic cases,
   though further numeric detail was not reported. When including all PCR results across follow-up for
   asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases (including negative PCR results), asymptomatic cases
   appeared to demonstrate lower CT values overall, which was proposed to indicate faster viral
   clearance21.
   Direct investigation of duration of viral shedding was limited. Lombardi et al. (2020)30 found that median
   duration from positive test to first negative test was shorter in asymptomatic participants (22 days; IQR:
   15–30) than symptomatic ones (29 days; IQR: 24–31), but the difference was not statistically significant.
   Danis et al. (2020)20 reported that the single asymptomatic case demonstrated the same viral load
   dynamics as one of the five symptomatic cases, with respective viral shedding periods of 7 and 6 days.
   Age of Symptomatic versus Asymptomatic Cases
   Six studies21,27,29,31,33,37 reported information regarding the age of asymptomatic versus symptomatic
   cases. Variation in measurement and reporting precluded meta-analysis. Findings are reported in Table
   3. Three studies indicated no significant difference in age between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases,
   while three studies suggested that asymptomatic cases tended to be younger than those with symptoms.
   Five studies were conducted in general population samples (contacts/potential contacts of confirmed
   cases or returning travellers), and one study was conducted in nursing home residents and staff with
   results stratified for these groups. Only one study29 reported a substantial child sub-sample (<14 years
   old), and found a higher asymptomatic proportion for infected children (23% n=10/43) than adults (7%,
   n=8/108).
   Discussion
   Accurate estimates of the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections depend on appropriate
   study designs that systematically detect asymptomatic viral shedding and follow these cases up to
   differentiate truly asymptomatic infections from pre-clinical shedding. We calculated that an overall
   estimate of 23% of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in community settings were asymptomatic,
   with a 95% confidence interval between 16%-30%. These findings do not support claims                        6,7,8 of a very

   high asymptomatic proportion for PCR-confirmed infections (up to 80%) and highlight the importance of
   distinguishing between asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. Heterogeneity in estimates of the
   asymptomatic proportion, however, was partly influenced by variation between testing contexts. Subgroup
   estimates range from 6% (95%CI 0-17%) for household contacts, increasing to 23% (95% CI 14-32%) for
   participants with other epidemiological links to case(s) or outbreaks, and the highest estimate of 47%
   (95% CI 21-74%) for point prevalence studies not directly linked to contact(s)/outbreaks.
   These findings should be interpreted with caution in terms of the relationship between exposure and
   symptom status38. The assumption that household contacts of index cases may experience frequent and
   intense exposure with limited protection compared to other groups, and conversely that participants in
   non-outbreak studies may have more limited exposure, could not be empirically verified in the present
   review. Confidence intervals for subgroup asymptomatic proportions overlapped substantially, and data
   were limited for both the household contact and the point prevalence survey with symptom follow-up
   categories (both n=3 included studies). Furthermore, the estimate for point prevalence surveys was
   affected by one study35 with a very high asymptomatic proportion (91%); this estimate was likely
   influenced by the limited symptomatic case definition of new-onset cough or fever. Estimates for the other
   two studies were similar to the ‘other epidemiological link’ category (26% and 29%). Only one of the point
   prevalence studies with symptom follow-up36 was conducted in a general population sample.
   Furthermore, the ‘other epidemiological link’ category comprised a variety of study testing contexts,
   including studies that combined household contacts with participants with less intensive exposure, which
   likely contributed to substantial within-category heterogeneity. Despite these substantial limitations,
   further investigation is warranted into variability in the asymptomatic proportion across testing contexts as
   more data become available.
   This effect of study context may partially account for differences between the overall estimate of the
   asymptomatic proportion in the current review and higher estimates from other studies. Notably, early
   population-based data collected from English households by the Office for National Statistics suggested
   that only 22% (95% CI 14-32%) of the 88 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 thus far reported
   any symptoms, rising to 29% (95% CI 19-40%) of the 76 individuals tested repeatedly8. Similarly, 69% of
   another English community sample recruited regardless of symptom status reported no symptoms in the
   seven days up to their positive PCR result39. However, neither of these studies systematically followed-up
   cases regarding their symptoms across the course of infection, potentially overestimating the
   asymptomatic proportion and precluding inclusion in this review. Furthermore, findings were affected by
   the small sample size and consequently wide confidence intervals due to testing at a period of relatively
   low COVID-19 incidence in the population, as well as potential false positive PCR tests leading to an
   overestimate of asymptomatic cases. While some of these issues may have impacted studies included in
   the present review, the careful screening of study design and methodology done as part of this review
   was reflected in the overall very low or low risk of bias on assessed criteria for all but four included
   studies. An additional strength of our review is the systematic search of both peer-reviewed published
   literature and preprint studies which has enabled us to capture the most up to date estimates available.

   Although this review identifies PCR-confirmed cases, PCR-confirmation and symptom-status alone
   cannot establish whether cases are infectious and, if so, the degree or duration of their infectiousness.
   Case reports, however, have indicated potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from some asymptomatic
   index cases 1,2,9,21. The balance of evidence regarding viral load in the present review indicates that
   asymptomatic cases had similar baseline or overall median viral loads to pre-symptomatic and
   symptomatic cases. Virological evidence suggests that infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be isolated by viral
   culture from samples with cycle threshold values up to 33, though the proportion of infectious virus
   decreases at higher cycle threshold values (i.e. lower viral load) 40. While median baseline cycle threshold
   values for all symptom status groups (23.1-25.5) reported by Arons et al. (2020)18 fell well within this limit,
   infectious virus was isolated from only 33% of asymptomatic baseline samples, compared to 71% of pre-
   symptomatic and 65% of symptomatic samples. These findings should be interpreted with caution given
   the very small sample of asymptomatic specimens (n=3). Overall, clear reporting of cycle threshold
   values across follow-up by symptom status was lacking in included studies. This is an important area for
   further research given that the degree and duration of the infectious period for asymptomatic cases, as
   well as the overall proportion of virus-shedding cases that are asymptomatic, influence the contribution of
   asymptomatic cases to SARS-CoV-2 transmission at a population level.
   Evidence regarding the duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding by symptom status was very limited, with two
   studies suggesting no substantial difference in viral clearance times for asymptomatic and symptomatic
   cases. Duration of shedding varied widely between participants across all symptom status groups in
   included studies. The sample of asymptomatic cases in studies that reported duration of viral shedding
   also tended to be small, and the natural history of viral excretion by symptom status remains unclear.
   Further inquiry into the degree of preclinical shedding for pre-symptomatic cases, although not the focus
   of this review, is also warranted. The contribution of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases to the
   overall spread of infection cannot be accurately inferred in the absence of high-quality evidence
   assessing the infectiousness of such cases41.
   Evidence was also split regarding age and symptom status, with three studies indicating no difference in
   age between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and three studies indicating that asymptomatic cases
   may tend to be younger than those with symptoms. Samples in the present study – both within the age-
   related analysis and in the meta-analysis overall – tended to comprise primarily or exclusively of adults,
   and one study with a substantial child subsample29 found that a larger proportion of infected children were
   asymptomatic (23%) than adults (7%). Further comparison of the asymptomatic proportion for children
   and adults is required.
   An important limitation of this review was the variability between symptomatic case definitions across
   included studies. Only eight of the twenty-one included studies18,22-24,30,32,35,37 described the full range of
   symptoms included within their symptomatic case definitions, while a further ten studies19,20,23,25-29,33,34
   reported details of symptoms endorsed by participants but did not specify whether or which additional

   symptoms were assessed as part of their case definitions and three17,31,36 provided no detail. While a
   similar range of symptoms appear to have been monitored/endorsed across most included studies, it is
   possible that symptomatic case identification may have been affected by reporting bias and consequently
   that the true proportion of symptomatic cases was underestimated. Notably, Starling et al. (2020)                      35  – the
   study with the highest reported asymptomatic proportion (91%) – used a very limited case definition of
   new-onset cough or fever. The reported proportion likely reflects individuals not meeting this case
   definition and excludes cases with other symptom profiles. This issue is particularly relevant given that
   unusual symptoms such as dysosmia/anosmia - only explicitly investigated by four studies21,28,30,37 - and
   dysgeusia/ageusia -only explicitly investigated by two studies28,30 - may be the primary or sole symptom
   for some COVID-19 cases             42-44. Demographic reporting across studies was also limited and it was not
   possible to stratify findings by further demographic characteristics. Estimates of the asymptomatic
   proportion may vary across population subgroups and this is a relevant area for future enquiry.
   We included only studies with symptom-related follow-up to prevent symptom status misclassification.
   However, overestimation of the asymptomatic proportion may still occur in contact tracing studies initiated
   during established outbreaks, such as Graham et al. (2020)24., if baseline symptomatic participants are
   classified as index cases and systematically excluded from the asymptomatic proportion. This review was
   also limited to estimating the asymptomatic proportion of virologically-confirmed infections. The
   asymptomatic proportion of infection varies depending on whether infections are identified using
   virological or serological methods45. PCR confirmation, which identifies infection with viral shedding, is
   informative for modelling transmission potential. However, review of the asymptomatic proportion of total
   infections based on emerging serological evidence – which identifies infections regardless of viral
   shedding – will be informative to understand how far SARS-CoV-2 has spread within populations and
   investigate evidence of immunity following asymptomatic infection46.
   Overall, this review provides preliminary evidence that, when investigated using methodologically-
   appropriate studies, a substantial minority of SARS-CoV-2 infections with viral shedding are truly
   asymptomatic. These findings indicate that testing should not be exclusively limited to symptomatic
   individuals. Further research identifying distinguishing features (e.g. age) and testing contexts for truly
   asymptomatic cases, as well as their transmission potential, is recommended to inform testing
   programmes. These findings also highlight the importance of other public health measures, such as
   promoting social distancing and wearing face coverings in public places, regardless of symptom status.

   Testing
   Figure 1 Note: This figure demonstrates two trajectories of symptom development in cases with detectable viral shedding. The
   symptomatic case trajectory comprises a period of pre-clinical viral shedding, in which the individual demonstrates no symptoms but
   tests PCR positive (pre-symptomatic PCR-confirmed). These individuals subsequently develop symptoms and continue to shed
   virus (symptomatic PCR-confirmed). Consequently, cases with a symptomatic trajectory may appear to be asymptomatic if tested in
   the pre-clinical shedding period and not followed-up. Asymptomatic cases with viral shedding, conversely, test PCR positive and
   never go on to develop symptoms across the course of infection (asymptomatic PCR-confirmed).

   Table 1. Risk of Bias Assessment
    Potential Issue                                              Direction of Bias
    Information Bias: Initial testing does not identify all      Effect estimate could be biased downwards if PCR testing is
    infected people shedding virus                               more likely to detect symptomatic shedders compared to
                                                                 asymptomatic shedders. This could be because asymptomatic
                                                                 cases shed less virus or shed for a shorter duration.
    Information Bias: Difficulty distinguishing pre-clinical     Effect estimate could be biased upwards if pre-symptomatic
    versus truly asymptomatic                                    cases are misclassified as asymptomatic (see figure 1)
    Non-Participation Bias: Individuals opt out of initial       Effect estimate could be biased in either direction if participation
    PCR testing or out of symptom follow-up                      is influenced on symptom-status

symptoms and not systematic PCR-testing; g only residents included as staff testing was not systematic and was partially based on
symptom status; h demographics reported for asymptomatic participants only; i demographics reported for PCR-positive cases or
those with clinical abnormalities only; j excludes index case and two PCR-positive case without symptom follow-up; k demographics
for children only but adults included in clinical outcomes; l 8 participants excluded because of insufficient data; m staff excluded due
