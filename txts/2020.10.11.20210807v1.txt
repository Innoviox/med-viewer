          Abstract-
          Background: There is always an uncertainty of epidemiological , serological infectivity and virulence
          of the emerging novel coronavirus. Antibody test can be used for assessing whether immunity has
          developed in the infected person after 5-7 days of illness and understand cumulative exposure levels
          to the infection, make inferences on the actual burden of infection, its geographical spread, effect
          on specific demographic/risk groups, gaps in testing and infection fatality rates.
          Objective-
          To estimate and compare the sero-prevalence, hidden prevalence and determine the demographic
          risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among adults in three largest cities of Odisha,
          India.
          Methodology: This was a population based cross sectional serological survey carried out in August
          2020 in the three largest cities of the state of Odisha. Sample size per city was estimated to be 1500
          and participants were enrolled from the community using multi-stage random sampling from 25
          clusters from each city. Data was collected using ODK based tools by household visits and 3-4 ml of
          blood samples were collected after informed consent. Samples were transported to testing lab

          where Serum was separated and tested for anti- SARS CoV-2 antibodies using automated CLIA
          platform. Statistical analysis was done using R-software packages.
          Results: A total of 4146 participants from the 3 cities of Bhubaneswar (BBS), Berhampur (BAM) and
          Rourkela (RKL) participated. A total of 5635 households were approached and the average non
          response rate in the community was 17.4%. The gender weighted seroprevalence across the three
          cities was 20.78% (95% CI: 19.56%-22.05%). Seroprevalence was highest in BAM at 31.14% (95% CI:
          28.69-33.66%) followed by 24.59% (95% CI: 22.39-26.88%) in RKL and 5.24% (95% CI: 4.10-6.58%) in
          BBS. While females reported a higher seroprevalence (22.8%) as compared to males (18.8%), there
          was no significant difference in seroprevalence across age groups. A majority of the seropositive
          participants were asymptomatic (93.87%). Among those who reported symptoms, the most
          common symptom was fever (68.89%) followed by cough (46.06%) and myalgia (32.67%). The case
          to infection ratio on the date of serosurvey was 1: 6.6 in BBS, 1:61 in BAM and 1:29.8 in RKL.
          Conclusion: The study found a high seroprevalence against COVID-19 in urban Odisha as well as high
          numbers of asymptomatic infections.
          Background-
          The COVID19 pandemic has so far affected 216 countries and caused more than 32 million cases and
          about a million deaths worldwide.(1)India has the second largest number of cases at 5.9 million and
          has been reporting about a quarter of the daily global incident cases for some time now. (2) While
          the pandemic is at different stages across the country, there seems to be significant local differences
          in the progression within the states as well. The state of Odisha in eastern India contributes over 3%
          of the active case load but with less than 1% of the cumulative mortality in the country. (2) The
          pandemic in the state has till now been largely driven by urban clusters with major cities
          contributing the most to the caseload. (3) Large population size with high density, presence of slums,
          variable adherence to preventive measures and a sizeable migrant population seem to be the
          common characteristics driving the transmission of infection in these cities. These regions remain
          critical to the COVID-19 response of the state.
          As with any novel respiratory infection, there is an uncertainty of epidemiological, serological,
          infectivity and virulence related information of SARS-CoV-2. (4)Testing strategies and capacities have
          been evolving but broadly, until now,it has been focused on the symptomatic and higher risk groups,
          which tend to overestimate the burden of the infection in the community due to biased
          denominator. (4–6) Additionally, the role of pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic and subclinical
          infection in disease transmission dynamics is also not well understood. (4)
          While viral nucleic acid detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is considered
          the gold standard frontline test for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, it is useful only when performed
          in the acute stage of infection.(7)Usually, antibody tests can be used for disease detection after 5–7
          days of illness. IgM antibodies are evident in the blood for the first two months and IgG antibodies
          generally start appearing after two weeks of onset of infection and last for several months. (8–
          10)Thus, although these tests are not useful for detecting acute infection, population based sero-
          epidemiological studies could be useful to understand cumulative exposure levels to the infection
          and make inferences on the actual burden of infection, its geographical spread, effect on specific
          demographic/risk groups, gaps in testing and infection fatality rates. (4,10)The information from
          such studies will also be helpful for designing and monitoring immunization programs, as and when a
          vaccine is available.(11)This evidence will inform the policy makers to plan and implement public
          health interventions for prevention and control of the pandemic. Thus the following sero survey is

          proposed to assess the extent of infection in the community and specific groups with the following
          objective:
          Objective-
          To estimate and compare the sero-prevalence, hidden prevalence and determine the demographic
          risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among adults in three largest cities of Odisha,
          India.
          Methodology-
          This was a population based cross sectional serological survey carried out in August 2020 in the
          three largest cities of the state of Odisha in eastern India with a total population of over 2 million.
          The study population was randomly selected from the community members of the municipal wards
          from each of the city. Adults residing in the city since at least the past 3 months and who agreed to
          provide written informed consent for data and sample collection were included in the study. We
          excluded pregnant women, bed ridden patients and those with recognizable cognitive impairment.
          Minimum sample size per city was calculated to be 1437. This was done on the Open Epi ver3.0
          software using the following formula-
                                             n = [Deff*Np(1-p)]/ [(d2/Z21-α/2*(N-1)+p*(1-p)]
          We assumed a sero-prevalence of 15%, which has been reported in urban regions of India during the
          same time period, relative precision of 20%, a design effect of 2.2 (calculated using a weak interclass
          correlation and a cluster size of 60), a finite population and a non-response rate of 20%. (12–14)This
          was rounded off to 1500 per city.
          Multi-stage random sampling was used for recruiting participants. For every city, the municipal
          wards were treated as clusters and 25 wards were selected based on probability proportional to
          size. Residential street names in the ward were listed and the street from where the sampling began
          (as well as direction of sampling) in each cluster was selected by computerized simple random
          method. Households in the street were selected using systematic random sampling and one eligible
          individual was selected from each household using an age ordered matrix. Locked house and/or non-
          response were recorded and the sampling frame was shifted by one household to the immediate
          adjacent house in these cases. The sampling framework is provided below in figure-1.

          Data on the socio-demographic variables, exposure history with a confirmed (and/or suspected)
          case, symptom profile in the last 30 days, geographical location, travel and testing history were
          collected in a structured tool by trained field investigators who conducted participant interviews. An
          Open Data Kit based electronic data capture tool was used for this purpose. Following all aseptic
          precautions, 3-4 ml blood samples were collected in the field by trained phlebotomists by
          venepuncture and transferred to vacutainers. These were transported maintaining cold chain (2-8 o
          C) to the serology laboratory at Indian Council of Medical Research-Regional Medical Research
          Centre in Bhubaneswar(ICMR-RMRC) for analysis. Additionally, secondary data on the daily number
          of antigen tests carried out, number of positives and deaths due to COVID-19 were obtained for the
          past 3 months from government sources directly.
          Serum samples were subjected to detection in Roche Cobas e411 for the presence of IgG antibodies
          against COVID-19 using Electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) based technique which is
          based on test principle of double-antigen sandwich assay and provides the result in 18 minutes.
          Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 is an immunoassay for the in vitro qualitative detection of antibodies
          (including IgG) to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and plasma. The assay uses a recombinant protein
          representing the nucleocapsid (N) antigen for the determination of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
          The test is intended as an aid in the determination of the immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2.
          Testing procedures were followed as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Patient’s sample (20 μL)
          were incubated with a mix of biotinylated and ruthenylatednucleocapsid (N) antigen. Double-
          antigen sandwich immune complexes (DAGS) are formed in the presence of corresponding
          antibodies. After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the DAGS complexes bind to the
          solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. After that the reagent mixture was transferred
          to the measuring cell, where the microparticles were magnetically captured onto the surface of the
          electrode. Unbound substances were subsequently removed. Electrochemiluminescence was then

          induced by applying a voltage and measured with a photomultiplier. The signal yield increased with
          the antibody titre. The value was expressed in Cut off Index (CoI) and a value of <1.0 was considered
          non-reactive and COI ≥1.0 was reactive.
          The sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated as proportion along with 95%
          confidence intervals and its distribution assessed across cities and demographic parameters. Gender
          weights were added in prevalence estimates in order to account for a higher non-response rate in
          females. The infection-to-case ratio and the infection fatality rate were calculated. Median time of
          seroconversion was assessed by a time dependent plot among those previously tested positive for
          SARS-CoV-2 by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Temporal comparisons of the
          community seroprevalence estimates with the detected number of cumulative cases, active cases,
          recoveries and deaths was done. Heat maps for varying seroprevalence were built for each of the
          city’s wards. Statistical analyses were done using R (ver. 4.0.2) software packages and GIS analysis
          was done using QGIS (ver. 3.10).
          Interviews were conducted ensuring privacy. All data was stored securely under the investigator’s
          responsibility, with a focus on ensuring the confidentiality of study participants. The final report and
          publications are based on aggregate data without any identifying information. A database with
          electronic tracking, password-restricted access and audit trail, with time and date stamps on data
          entry and edits, was used for quality control. State Health Department and city administration
          authorities were actively engaged to ensure smooth operationalization and also to reduce any
          stigma among the residents. Written informed consent for participation was obtained and a
          participant information sheet was provided to each household. Approval for the protocol was
          obtained from the ICMR RMRC Institutional Human Ethics Committee and the State Health and
          research ethics committee. The study methods, analyses and reporting have been informed by the
          WHO Unity protocols and ICMR National Serosurvey protocol in India.(15,16)

          Figure-2. Study Flow diagram of the sample collection process
          Among the study participants, 1553 were females and the rest males. The non-response rates were
          significantly higher among females (27.6%) as compared to males (12.4%). The mean age of the
          study participants was 44.20 (± 14.2) years.
          The gender weighted seroprevalence across the three cities was 20.78% (95% CI: 19.56%-22.05%).
          This was highest in BAM at 31.14% (95% CI: 28.69%-33.66%) followed by 24.59% (95% CI: 22.39%-
          26.88%) in RKL and 5.24% (95% CI: 4.10%-6.58%) in BBS. While females reported a higher
          seroprevalence (22.8%) as compared to males (18.8%), there was no significant difference in
          seroprevalence across age groups.
          The demographic characteristics of the study population and the distribution of seroprevalence is
          provided in table-1 below.

          Among those who had seroconversion and also had been tested positive by PCR, the median
          duration between both was 31 days.
          The cumulative number of cases detected as on 1st September were 11641 in BBS, 3277 in BAM and
          5362 in RKL. The association between time trends of the progression of the daily new cases and
          cumulative cases and the time point of seroprevalence estimates is given in figure-3a and 3b below.

          Discussion
          This COVID-19 serosurvey involving more than 4000 participants from the three largest cities of
          Odisha found an overall seroprevalence of 20.78%, although there was wide variation in
          seroprevalence between the cities. The study included only adult population. As educational

          institutions remain closed and lockdowns of various degrees have been imposed in the study setting
          since the pandemic began, the likelihood of adults being the source of household infection is high.
          Although molecular tests are being used for diagnosis of active symptomatic and asymptomatic
          cases of COVID-19, antibody based tests can provide a more robust and comprehensive knowledge
          about the actual spread of infection in the community. (17)Seroprevalence studies on COVID-19
          have been reported globally to assess the spread of infection either in the general population or
          focussing on certain high risk groups. Seroprevalence studies performed on health care workers
          across countries such as Germany, Belgium, United Kingdom, Malawi, and Italy, have reported wide
          variation in seropositivity ranging from 1.6% in Germany to 15.6% in Pakistan.(18–23) However, such
          studies on population involved in high risk professions, though useful in informing trends of infection
          in such occupations, do not provide information about exposure at the population level and
          inferences possible are limited.
          Globally, there have been few reports on seroprevalence against COVID-19 in the community. An
          early study on seroprevalence from Lombardy, Italy, involving 390 blood donors showed that 23% of
          the donors were positive for anti-COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies. (24)A community-based study
          from British Columbia in Canada, involving serial cross-sectional sampling, reported a seroprevalence
          of only 0.28% in March 2020, and 0.55% in May 2020. (25)Another community based weekly
          serosurvey conducted in April 2020 in Geneva, Switzerland, reported a seroprevalence of 3.1%,
          6.1%, and 9.7% during the first, second, and third week respectively, with a significantly higher
          seroprevalence in less than 50 years age group. (26)Such studies involving periodic sampling are
          extremely valuable in monitoring the spread of the infection in certain areas, and understanding the
          dynamics of community transmission as well as residual susceptibility. (25)In China, the
          seroprevalence in Guangzhou and Wuhan, the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, was reported to
          be 0.6% and 2.1% respectively till April 2020. (27)During the same month, a study from Santa Clara
          County, California, reported a seroprevalence of 2.8% (95% CI 1.3-4.7%). (28)These studies across
          countries indicate that the actual spread of COVID-19 infection in the community was much higher
          than that reported by detection of active cases using molecular methods. Our study also presents
          evidence to support this case.
          Few studies on seroepidemiology of COVID-19 have been reported from Asia till date. A national
          serosurvey from India conducted during May-June, 2020, which included 28000 individuals from 70
          districts of 21 Indian states, reported the seroprevalence to be approximately 0.73% (95% CI: 0.34-
          1.13). (29)This indicated that the cumulative COVID-19 infections in India was approximately 6.46
          million by the beginning of May 2020. Compared to our study, the low seroprevalence reported in
          the national serosurvey may be due to the difference in study period (May-June in the national
          serosurvey compared to August in our study). While our study showed females to be more infected,
          the national serosurvey found males to have significantly higher seroprevalence. The infection to
          case ratio (ICR) in this national serosurvey varied between 81.6 and 130.1 with May 11 and May 3,
          2020, as reference points for reported cases. (29)This is higher than that reported in our study
          (ranging from 6.6 in Bhubaneswar to 61 in Berhampur). The steady increase in testing and
          subsequent improvement in case identification may be the reason for this difference. Similar to our
          study, the national serosurvey also reported a higher seropositivity rate in occupations with high risk
          of exposure to potentially infected persons. (29)Very few other countries from Asia have conducted
          serosurveys for COVID-19 in their general population. A recently reported community based study
          from Karachi, Pakistan, has reported a seroprevalence of 8.7% (95% CI 5.1-13.1) and 15.1% (95% CI
          9.4-21.7) in low and high transmission areas respectively, with no significant difference between
          males and females. (30) Similarly, the seroprevalence reported from two community clinics in Tokyo

          was 3.83% (95% CI 2.76-5.16). (31)While others have reported a higher seroprevalence among the
          elderly, our study did not find any difference between the age groups with respect to their
          seropositivity. Thus, the evidence till date is showing significant regional as well as time dependant
          variations in findings of serosurveys to assess the exposure to SARS-CoV-2.Most serosurveys,
          including ours have reported a large majority of infections to be asymptomatic in nature. Among the
          symptomatic cases, the most common symptom was fever followed by cough and diarrhea as a
          symptom was strongly associated with seropositivity.
          An interesting finding is higher seropositivity in members of larger households indicating the higher
          risk of household transmission among them. Correlation with the actual detected epidemic curves of
          the three cities show a trend where with higher seroprevalence, there is consistent relative
          flattening. Thus the possibility of herd immunity being achieved at some point of time in the
          population cannot be ruled out. GIS analysis shows that wards detected with high seropositivity did
          not necessarily report more detected cases, implying gaps in testing in those regions.
          Our study had a few limitations. The participants were only adults and the non-response rate was
          high (17.4%), and hence, the possibility of selection bias cannot be excluded. The non response was
          higher among females probably due to cultural factors and higher individual apprehensions towards
          blood sample collection. The study reported on the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at a
          point in time. Follow up data on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the same subjects will be required to
          understand the duration of immunity to natural infection as well as protection against reinfection.
          Serial cross-sectional serosurevs have been planned in the same population to address this issue and
          estimate the rate of spread of COVID-19 infection in Odisha.
          To conclude, our study found a high seroprevalence against COVID-19 in urban Odisha. Future
          studies integrating the seroprevalence data with sociocultural and other biological data will help us
          better understand the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission and the susceptibility to infection at the
          individual and community level. It will also help us understand the effectiveness of the several steps
          undertaken by the state and central Government such as social distancing, usage of masks, etc, in
          preventing the spread of COVID-19 infection in the community. However, we should be careful while
          interpreting the findings of a seroprevalence study. There is still no concrete data to support the fact
          that presence of antibodies against COVID-19 is protective against reinfection. Also, seroprevalence
          studies should not be used to stigmatize any community or politicized to underestimate the efforts
          of any government in reducing the spread of infection in their respective countries.
