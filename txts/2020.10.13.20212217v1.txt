          ABSTRACT
          Purpose: Premenopausal women diagnosed with estrogen receptor (ER) positive
          breast cancer are prescribed 5–10 years of endocrine therapy to prevent or delay
          recurrence. Many women who initiate endocrine therapy fail to complete the
          recommended course of treatment. In this study, we evaluated the association
          between early discontinuation of adjuvant endocrine therapy and breast cancer
          recurrence in a cohort of premenopausal women.
          Patients and Methods: We identified 4,503 premenopausal ER+ breast cancer
          patients who initiated adjuvant endocrine therapy and were registered in the Danish
          Breast Cancer Group clinical database (2002–2011). Women were excluded if they
          had a recurrence or were lost to follow-up less than 1.5 years after breast cancer
          surgery. Endocrine therapy was considered complete if the patient received at least
          4.5 years of treatment or discontinued medication less than 6 months before
          recurrence. Exposure status was updated annually and modeled as a time-
          dependent variable. We accounted for baseline and time-varying confounders via
          time-varying weights, which we calculated from multivariable logistic regression
          models and included in regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and
          accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CI) associating early discontinuation with
          breast cancer recurrence.
          Results: Over the course of follow-up, 1,001 (22%) women discontinued endocrine
          therapy. We observed 202 (20%) recurrences among those who discontinued
          endocrine therapy, and 388 (11%) among those who completed the recommended
          treatment. The multivariable-adjusted estimated rate of recurrence was higher in
          women who discontinued endocrine therapy relative to those who completed their
          treatment (HR=1.67, 95% CI 1.25, 2.14).
          Conclusion: These results highlight the importance of clinical follow-up and
          behavioral interventions that support persistence of adjuvant endocrine therapy to
          prevent breast cancer recurrence.

           Background
                    More than two-thirds of premenopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer
          have estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease and are therefore candidates for
          endocrine therapy.1 Current guidelines recommend that premenopausal women
          diagnosed with ER-positive tumors receive adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for at least
          five years post-diagnosis to prevent or delay a recurrence.2 Tamoxifen is a selective
          ER modulator with metabolites that compete with estrogen at the ER binding site.3
          Tamoxifen was first introduced in the adjuvant setting in 1989 with treatment
          guidelines recommending one year of adjuvant therapy.4 As evidence from clinical
          trials accumulated, treatment guidelines have extended the intended duration of
          adjuvant tamoxifen therapy from one year, to two years, to five years.5 A pooled
          analysis of tamoxifen clinical trials among breast cancer patients diagnosed with ER-
          positive disease reported risk ratios (RR) for the effect of one, two, and five years of
          tamoxifen therapy versus placebo of 0.79, 0.72, and 0.50, respectively.6 Since 2013,
          a duration of up to ten years of tamoxifen is recommended for premenopausal
          women diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer.7 These changes in guidelines
          reflect accumulating evidence of the benefit of longer duration tamoxifen therapy.
                    Barriers         to     tamoxifen        treatment     adherence         and      completion       include
          sociodemographic characteristics suggestive of poor access to resources,
          concurrent medication use, disease severity, and overall health status of the
          patient.8–13 Lower treatment completion has been observed in younger patients
          (aged less than 40 years), unmarried patients, and those with a low level of social
          support.14 Switching hormonal therapies can also reduce adherence.15,16 Endocrine
          therapies sometimes cause adverse side effects (e.g. hot flashes, nausea, fatigue,
                                                                                                                                4

          continue therapy.17,18
                    Early discontinuation and poor adherence to prescribed therapies may
          contribute to poor patient outcomes. In the US, approximately 50% of breast cancer
          patients never complete the intended duration of endocrine therapy.19 In Denmark,
          the proportion of patients completing adjuvant therapy is higher. A population-based
          study using the Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) clinical database reported that
          approximately 84% of postmenopausal breast cancer patients in Denmark
          completed endocrine therapy, which was defined as medication use for at least 4.5
          years.20 No study has quantified the effect of early discontinuation of adjuvant
          endocrine therapy on breast cancer recurrence in an exclusively premenopausal
          cohort. In this study, we quantify the association between early discontinuation of
          endocrine therapy and breast cancer recurrence among premenopausal women with
          a stage I–III first primary breast cancer diagnosis in Denmark.
          Methods
          Study Population
                    Denmark provides universal tax-funded health care with residency-based
          entitlement and availability of government-maintained nationwide                                         registries,
          providing longitudinal sources of routinely collected administrative, health, and
          clinical quality data.21 The Predictors of Breast Cancer Recurrence (ProBe CaRe)
          cohort is a study of premenopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer in
          Denmark and reported to the DBCG.22 The cohort includes 4,600 women diagnosed
          with stage I–III ER-positive primary breast cancer between January 1, 2002 and
          December 31, 2011. Women were excluded if they had a previous cancer diagnosis.

          As breast cancer recurrences that occur within the first 1.5 years following breast
          cancer surgery are unlikely to be related to endocrine therapy, we also excluded 97
          women in the cohort (68 of whom were diagnosed with a breast cancer recurrence)
          who had less than 1.5 years of follow-up. The final study population included 4,503
          premenopausal women diagnosed with ER-positive breast cancer. Members of the
          cohort had follow-up information available until August 31, 2019, with recurrence
          follow-up from 1.5 years after surgery until the first of a) recurrence, b) death, c) 10
          years of follow-up, d) loss to follow-up due to emigration, e) another incident
          malignancy, or f) the end of available follow-up. Mortality and emigration were
          identified using the Danish Civil Registration System, which is updated daily.23
          Emigration or withdrawal from clinical follow-up were the only sources of loss of
          follow-up, which have impacted less than 5% of the study population. This study was
          approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (record number KEA-2017-4), the
          Danish Medicines Agency, the DBCG (DBCG-2014-15), and the local Institutional
          Review Boards of the US co-investigators. This study is based on routinely collected
          registry data, so Danish law does not require an ethical board’s approval in
          Denmark, nor does it require patient consent to participate.
          Exposure: Early Discontinuation
                    According to the DBCG guidelines, women diagnosed with breast cancer are
          recommended to undergo semi-annual examinations during the first 5 years after
          diagnosis and annual examinations in years 6–10.24 Women undergoing treatment
          for breast cancer receive endocrine therapy at the treating hospital at each follow-up
          visit. Treatments prescribed during these follow-up visits are registered by the
          DBCG, which documents whether a treatment was received and the type of therapy
                                                                                                                                6

          (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors). At each visit, a 6-month supply of endocrine
          therapy is dispensed.
                      Early discontinuation of endocrine therapy was defined as receipt of
          endocrine therapy for less than 4.5 years. If a recurrence, emigration, or death
          occurred before 5 years elapsed after treatment initiation, then discontinuation of
          therapy was deemed early if therapy was discontinued more than half a year before
          the event. Initiation of endocrine therapy was defined as the first date of receipt of
          endocrine therapy according to the DBCG registry. Discontinuation of endocrine
          therapy was based on the last date of receipt of endocrine therapy, with
          consideration of the 6-month supply of endocrine therapy prescribed. Figure 1
          illustrates the cohort entry, induction period, and follow-up considerations.
          Covariates
                    Using the DBCG registry, the ProBe CaRe premenopausal cohort collected
          information about the first primary breast cancer diagnosis, including demographic,
          tumor, and treatment characteristics. This information included the date of surgery,
          type of surgery (mastectomy or breast conserving surgery), age at diagnosis, tumor
          size, tumor grade, lymph node status, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2
          (HER2) receptor expression (available after 2007), stage—derived from tumor size
          (T), lymph node status (N), and metastases (M)—, radiation therapy, anti-HER2
          therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Among baseline patient characteristics,
          potential        confounders            include      comorbidities       (Charlson          comorbidity      index),
          socioeconomic status (median household income in tertiles), marital status (single,
          married), and education (high school, college, or graduate school). Medication
          persistence—defined as the continued per-protocol use—can be influenced by time-
                                                                                                                                7

          varying covariates. As such, incident comorbid diagnoses during follow-up, initiation
          of concomitant medication, and switching from tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors
          were treated as potential time-varying confounders.
          Statistical Analysis
                    For descriptive analysis, we calculated the frequencies and proportions of
          patient demographic factors, tumor characteristics, treatments received, concomitant
          medications, and comorbidities within strata of tamoxifen early discontinuation
          status.        We then evaluated the association between early discontinuation and
          recurrence using two complementary approaches.
                    First, we used pooled logistic regression models to estimate the time-
          dependent hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association
          between early discontinuation of endocrine therapy and breast cancer recurrence.25
          The pooled logistic regression models allow for a flexible baseline hazard and
          produce estimates that approximate the average rate ratio, similar to a Cox
          proportional hazards model with a time-dependent exposure.26 The exposure is time-
          varying to allow for treatment discontinuation at different timepoints over the five or
          more years of prescribed endocrine therapy. We updated the exposure annually
          after endocrine treatment initiation. We present multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95%
          CI accounting for potential baseline confounders.
                      Realizing that the experience of women who discontinue adjuvant endocrine
          therapy is not likely exchangeable with the experience of women who continue on
          therapy, for the second approach, we used G-computation to estimate the effect of
          early discontinuation of tamoxifen therapy on breast cancer recurrence adjusted for
          baseline tumor, treatment, and patient-level characteristics as well as time-varying
                                                                                                                                8

          covariates.27 To perform this analysis, we first calculated stabilized time-varying
          weights for each year of treatment. The weights for each patient were calculated
          from multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the probability of early
          discontinuation in that time interval based on baseline characteristics and time-
          varying factors, namely concomitant medication use and comorbidity diagnoses
          during follow-up. We used stabilized weights, computed by dividing the probability of
          discontinuing            therapy       given      baseline     characteristics       by      the  probability        of
          discontinuing therapy given baseline characteristics and time-varying covariates.27
          These stabilized weights were then used as time-varying weights in a pooled logistic
          regression model to estimate the HR for the association between early treatment
          discontinuation and breast cancer recurrence. We calculated the accompanying 95%
          CI using nonparametric bootstrapping with 50 resamples.28
                    In a sensitivity analysis, we used a longer period to define early
          discontinuation. We allowed for 1.5 years between last date of prescription and end
          of follow-up, still considering a 6-month supply of endocrine therapy. This sensitivity
          analysis assumes that any event that occurred within one year of stopping endocrine
          therapy would not be due to early discontinuation of therapy.
          Results
                    Of the 4,503 premenopausal women included in the cohort, 1001 (22%)
          discontinued endocrine therapy over the course of follow-up (Table 1). The annual
          proportion of patients who discontinued therapy was lowest in the first year (2.6%),
          and gradually increased each year, culminating in a 6.7% discontinuation proportion

          recurrence (Figure 2). Compared with women who completed endocrine therapy,
          those who discontinued were less likely to have received chemotherapy (86% vs.
          92%) or radiation therapy (49% vs. 55%). Women who discontinued were also more
          likely to have had a comorbid condition at diagnosis (11% vs 8.4%), have had a
          lower household income (42% vs. 31%), have been single during follow-up (36% vs.
          32%), and have had a high school level of education (22% vs 19%).
                    In multivariable-adjusted models, early discontinuation of endocrine therapy
          was associated with an increase in the estimated rate of recurrence (HR=1.63, 95%
          CI: 1.30, 2.04) [Table 2]. Similarly, results from the G-computation approach (using
          time-varying weights) indicated that women who discontinued endocrine therapy had
          1.67 times the estimated rate of recurrence compared with women who continued
          endocrine therapy (95% CI: 1.25, 2.14). The crude results were comparable to the
          above approaches, suggesting little confounding by measured baseline or time-
          varying confounders (HR=1.59, 95% CI: 1.27, 2.00).
                    The sensitivity analyses, which defined completion of adjuvant endocrine
          therapy as four years of therapy or continuation of therapy for up to one year before
          a recurrence, yielded similar, although attenuated estimates (Table 2).
           Discussion
                    This study is the first to quantify the effect of early discontinuation of adjuvant
          endocrine therapy on breast cancer recurrence in a population-based cohort of
          premenopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer. We report that 22% of
          premenopausal women discontinued endocrine therapy before completing five years
          of recommended treatment. The estimated rate of breast cancer recurrence in this
          study was about 1.7-fold higher among women who discontinued endocrine therapy

          compared with those who completed their course of treatment. Among women who
          did not complete adjuvant endocrine therapy, most (57%) discontinued taking
          medication in the last two years of treatment.
                    Trial results have reported that 5 years of tamoxifen therapy, compared with
          placebo, reduced the risk of recurrence by nearly one-half among premenopausal
          women diagnosed with ER-positive breast cancer.29 This result suggests that lack of
          tamoxifen therapy among premenopausal women diagnosed with ER-positive breast
          cancer would nearly double the risk of recurrence compared with tamoxifen therapy
          of appropriate duration. A recent systematic review reported that 15%–20% of
          women discontinued tamoxifen therapy in the first year of therapy and 31%–60%
          discontinued by the end of 5 years.30–34 Although the review primarily included
          studies of U.S. populations—in which a greater proportion of women than in
          Denmark discontinue endocrine therapy—the pattern of discontinuation over the first
          5 years of therapy is comparable to the pattern observed in our study. A meta-
          analysis of trials comparing the benefit of 5 years vs 1–2 years of tamoxifen therapy
          reported 0.82 times the rate of recurrence.29 Therefore the expected increase in the
          rate of recurrence comparing 2 vs 5 years of tamoxifen therapy would be
          approximately 1.22 (1/0.82).29 The estimated effect from our study is further from the
          null than this expectation, likely due to a combination of factors. First, there is a
          difference in target populations, as the trials were conducted among both pre- and
          postmenopausal breast cancer patients, whereas our study is restricted to
          premenopausal women. Second, most women in our study who completed 5 years
          of tamoxifen therapy continued on therapy, given the change in guidelines from 5 to
          10 years of therapy in 2013.35 Third, our study estimated the rate ratio, which will be
          further from the null than the risk ratio reported from trials. Finally, we excluded
                                                                                                                              11

          recurrences in the first 1.5 years after diagnosis, which were included in the trial
          results. This exclusion reduces the number of events, and ratios of rarer events are
          often larger than ratios of more common events.36 Even though these women would
          have received some benefit from initiating therapy, evidence clearly supports the
          need for completion of the 5 years of tamoxifen therapy—and even extending to 10
          years—to acquire the full preventive benefit.
                    Before the end of 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy, 22% of women in
          our cohort discontinued treatment. This estimate is substantially lower than those
          from previous studies conducted in the U.S.;19 however, the proportion is slightly
          larger than the corresponding 16% of postmenopausal women who discontinued
          treatment reported in an earlier Danish study.20 This difference may be expected
          because some previous studies have shown that younger women are less likely to
          complete adjuvant endocrine therapy than older women.10 Similar to U.S.-based
          studies, we observed that women who discontinued therapy were more likely to
          report a lower household income, be unmarried, and have high school rather than
          third-level education, compared with women who completed therapy.37 Income,
          education, and healthcare access gaps are more pronounced in the U.S. than in
          Denmark, which is also correlated with healthcare access, and may partially explain
          the differences observed between our study and the review.38,39 The BIG 1-98
          study—a double-blind trial that randomized postmenopausal women to tamoxifen or
          aromatase inhibitors—reported tamoxifen discontinuation rates that were consistent
          with those observed in the current study (19%).40 In BIG 1-98, among
          postmenopausal women who were randomized to the tamoxifen arm, adverse
          events such as thromboembolic complications were the most common causes for
          treatment discontinuation.40 In the clinical setting, women who are at risk for or who
                                                                                                                              12

          experience thromboembolic complications are eligible to switch to aromatase
          inhibitors, which carry about half the risk of thrombotic events compared with
          tamoxifen.41,42 Still, adverse side effects are often reported as a reason that patients
          stop taking tamoxifen.12,43
                    Our results are comparable to those observed in other studies that were not
          restricted to premenopausal women. A study using a Kaiser Permanente patient
          database reported that early discontinuation was associated with higher all-cause
          mortality (HR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.46).44 In a Danish population-based cohort of
          postmenopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1996 and 2004,
          those who discontinued therapy had an increased hazard of recurrence (HR=1.45,
          95% CI: 1.14, 1.85).20 The associations observed in our study are more pronounced,
          underscoring             the       importance         of    endocrine       therapy         completion       among
          premenopausal women to prevent or delay a recurrence.
                    There are several limitations to consider. First, as with all population-based
          studies of medication use, we had information on prescriptions dispensed at each
          follow-up visit but could not be certain that endocrine therapy was taken as
          prescribed. It is likely that women who discontinued therapy before the
          recommended 5 years of treatment were also less likely to take the medication as
          indicated, even when they filled a prescription. Second, since 2013, the Danish
          guidelines recommend that tamoxifen be prescribed to premenopausal women for up
          to 10 years.7,35 We observed that, among women who completed at least 5 years of
          adjuvant endocrine therapy, 11% (n=405) completed 10 years of treatment, and 71%
          (n=2,565) continued taking medication for more than 5 years. The proportion of
          women receiving more than 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy increased as a
                                                                                                                              13

          function of year of diagnosis between 2002 and 2011. Given that our study
          population included women diagnosed with breast cancer through 2011, and with
          follow-up available until August 31, 2019, we were unable to examine the effect of
          discontinuation of tamoxifen therapy at 5 years compared with continuation for up to
          10 years. Third, we were unable to capture menopausal transition. We did observe
          that 40% of those who completed therapy and 30% of those who did not complete
          therapy switched from tamoxifen to an aromatase inhibitor. This suggests that a
          large proportion of women transitioned to menopause, but women may also switch
          type of therapy due to side effects. Finally, women who discontinued therapy were
          more likely to have had a recurrence within the first 5 years following their diagnosis
          compared with those who completed therapy (70% vs. 52%). This may reflect an
          innate resistance to adjuvant endocrine therapy.45–47 We excluded women with less
          than 1.5 years of follow-up or a recurrent event within the first 1.5 years following
          diagnosis to help mitigate this potential bias. Still, the hazard of recurrence is highest
          in the first 2–3 years after diagnosis, and the prevalence of discontinuation increases
          over time.48 The combination of eliminating the first 1.5 years of follow-up and a
          discontinuation proportion that increases over time suggests that the association
          observed in this study pertains to recurrences that occur after the initial high hazard
          period. If we assume that recurrences in the high hazard period reflect an innate
          resistance of the cancer rather than persistence of endocrine therapy, then our
          results are unbiased. However, future analyses might consider analyzing the results
          stratified based on year of discontinuation to look specifically at the influence of
          endocrine therapy on this early period of high recurrence hazard.

                    In conclusions, our results highlight the importance of clinical follow-up and
          behavioral interventions that support persistence of adjuvant endocrine therapy to
          prevent a recurrent event.
