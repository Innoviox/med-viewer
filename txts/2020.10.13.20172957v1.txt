    ABSTRACT
    Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
    (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with a world-wide pandemic, with the United States (US) having
    the largest total number of cases and deaths (>7 million and >200,000, respectively) at this time. We
    assessed data as of September 1, 2020 from our combined laboratories and as reported for selected
    states and countries for case, death, and testing rates per 1 million in the population. Our goal was to
    elucidate potential causes for the large rate differences observed. SARS-CoV-2 naso-pharyngeal (NP)
    RNA swab testing in 985,219 US subjects referred to our laboratories by healthcare providers revealed an
    overall 10.1% positive rate, comparable to the 7.3% rate reported nationwide. In a small subset of 91
    subjects, all of whom had been positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in NP swabs 2-4 weeks earlier, NP
    swab testing was twice as likely to be positive (58.6%) as saliva samples (21.5%), based on paired
    sampling. Our positive rates per state agreed reasonably well with reported Centers for Disease Control
    and Prevention (CDC) data (r=0.609, P<0.0001) based on 19,898 cases, 593 deaths, and 271,637 tests,
    all per 1 million in the US population. Louisiana had the highest case rate; New Jersey had the highest
    death rate; and Rhode Island had the highest testing rate. Of 47 countries, including all countries with
    populations >50 million, Qatar had the highest case rate; Peru had the highest death rate; and Israel had
    the highest testing rate for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Correlations between case rates and death rates as
    well as testing rates were 0.473 and 0.398 for US states and 0.488 and 0.395 for the various countries,
    respectively (all P<0.0001). In conclusion, outpatient saliva testing is not as sensitive as NP testing for
    SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. While testing is important, without adequate public health measures, it is
    unlikely that we will get this pandemic under adequate control until vaccines become available.

    INTRODUCTION
              Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
    coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is now associated with a world-wide pandemic (>30 million cases
    and >1 million deaths). The diagnosis is made by SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in naso-pharyngeal (NP)
    swabs, nasal swabs, oro-pharyngeal (OP) swabs, or saliva.1-4 The greatest number of deaths/1 million in
    the population has been reported in the densely populated northeastern states of the United States (US).
    Up to 50% of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients can remain symptomatic; however, such individuals can
    spread infections.5-7 The average onset of symptoms after infection is about 5 days (range 2-14 days).
    COVID-19 fatality is substantially higher in the elderly, and in those with cardiovascular disease,
    diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and lung disease.
              COVID-19 disease symptoms include fever, fatigue, cough, loss of smell and taste, gastro-
    intestinal symptoms, and shortness of breath. The virus spreads between people mainly via respiratory
    droplets generated by talking, singing, coughing, and/or sneezing. Severe complications include severe
    acute respiratory distress due to pneumonia (which may require a ventilator), and potentially death from
    overwhelming infection and inflammation.1-4 The virus is highly contagious, with about 50% of infected
    people being asymptomatic.5,6 While testing is critical for diagnosis and documentation of potential
    immunity, public health measures (e.g. face masks, shields, social distancing, and hand washing) are
    critical for prevention of new cases until a vaccine becomes available. Subjects that are positive for
    SARS-CoV-2 RNA based on NP swabs may not have transmissible virus over time, but only viral
    fragments.7 Our goals were to assess our own data as well as available US and worldwide data in terms of
    cases, deaths, and testing per 1 million in the population, in order to examine potential causes for the large
    rate differences observed between states and countries.
                                                                                                                                       4

    METHODS
    Populations studied
              A total of 985,219 subjects (58.2% female; age range 1-101 years; median [IQR] age 49.0 [35.0-
    6.0] years; 18.2% ≥65 years of age) were assessed in physician offices, clinics, and hospitals. These
    subjects had NP, OP, or nasal swab samples collected by healthcare providers at various sites throughout
    the United States, placed in viral transport media, and submitted by overnight express courier service for
    SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection to Boston Heart Diagnostics (Framingham, MA) beginning on April 17,
    2020, Diatherix (Huntsville, AL) beginning on March 16, 2020, and/or Viracor (Lee’s Summit, MO)
    beginning on March 13, 2020. For this analysis, data assessment was ended as of September 1, 2020.
    Table 1 presents data from hospitals, clinic sites, and healthcare provider offices in 38 states with more
    than 100 results for samples sent to these laboratories.
              For this research, patient data were extracted from medical records without name or identification
    number and were analyzed as anonymized data. In our view, this research is exempted from requirement
    for human institutional review board approval as per exemption 4, as listed at
    https://grants.nih.gov/policy/ humansubjects.htm and at the open education resource (OER) website for
    research involving human subjects. This exemption “involves the collection or study of data or specimens
    if publicly available or recorded such that subjects cannot be identified”. At the request of the preprint
    server medRxiv, we had this designation and our research reviewed by the Advarra Institutional Review
    Board (Columbia, MD) and their determination on September 26, 2020 was that “had the request for
    exempt determination been submitted prior to initiation of research activities, the research would have
    met the criteria for exemption from institutional review board review under 45 CFR 46.104(d) (4).
    Therefore, they agreed that this research did not require institutional review board approval.
              The paired NP swab and saliva samples were collected from previously positive convalescent
    plasma donors (n=91, mean age 53 years, 53% female) using a protocol and written informed consent
    form approved by the human institutional review board of Trinity Health of New England (Hartford, CT).
    These subjects had all been positive 2-4 weeks earlier for SARS-CoV-2 RNA based on NP swabs. The
                                                                                                                                       5

    saliva was collected in viral transport media kits obtained from Strategic Laboratory Partners (Nashville,
    TN).
              We also examined Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data from various states for
    comparison. We included Rhode Island because of the high case and death rates observed for this state.
    To obtain information on COVID-19 data for the states in the US and world-wide data, we accessed the
    CDC website on September 1, 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html#testing, as well
    as the website https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/? and the World Health Organization website
    https://www.covid19.who.int/.
    SARS-CoV-2 viral detection
              Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in NP, OP, nasal swabs or saliva was performed using reverse
    transcriptase polymerase chain reaction methods as previously described for the Viracor assay.8 Viracor
    was among the first US laboratories to offer SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing as of March 13, 2020. Viral
    detection and quantification in plasma was performed using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
    reaction (RT-PCR) method which targets two regions of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleo-capsid (N) gene using
    TaqMan chemistry. This assay is a modification of an assay approved by the Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) under emergency use authorization (EUA) guidelines for qualitative detection of
    SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples. Nucleic acid extraction was performed using the ThermoFisher
    KingFisher FLEX instrument with MagMAX Viral/Pathogen Nucleic Acid Isolation reagents.
    Amplification was performed using the Applied Biosystems™ 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR Systems (SDS
    v1.5.1) with TaqPath 1-step RT-qPCR master mix CG reagents. A total of 15 µL nucleic acid was
    amplified in a 30 µL reaction volume. The thermocycling protocol was as follows: 25˚C for 2:00 (1
    cycle), 50˚C for 15:00 (1 cycle), 95˚C for 2:00 (1 cycle), 95˚C for 0:03, 60C for 0:30 (45 cycles). For
    quantification, a standard curve was used by amplifying 10-fold serial dilutions (75 copies/mL to 7.5 x
    107 copies/mL) of in vitro transcribed RNA prepared from the full SARS-CoV-2 N gene. The copies/mL
    value for each sample which generated a cycle threshold value was calculated using the slope and y-
                                                                                                                                       6

    intercept derived from linear regression of the standard curve results.
              The Boston Heart Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay is very similar to the Viracor assay
    except that this assay uses Thermo-Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kits (Waltham, MA) and targets a
    region in the N gene, a region in the spike (S) glycoprotein gene, and a region in the ORF1 gene. Positive
    values are those detected at a cycle threshold values of ≤37 cycles. Boston Heart Diagnostics began
    offering its testing as of April 17, 2020.
              Diatherix began offering SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing as of March 16t, 2020, based on nested, end-
    point PCR technology that allows SARS-CoV-2 detection through target enrichment and amplification.
    The reaction process includes enrichment and tagging of the target, followed by traditional PCR
    amplification. First, nucleic acid is extracted from the sample. SARS-CoV-2 is amplified by low
    concentration nested gene-specific primers that are designed to enrich the targets during the initial PCR
    cycles. Inside nested primers have a unique tag sequence complementary to proprietary SuperPrimers (Fs
    and Rs), which are included in the primer mix. The universal SuperPrimers are used to amplify all targets
    by annealing to the complementary tag sequence on the inside nested primers. The reverse primer of the
    SuperPrimer set is labeled with biotin, which is incorporated into the resultant PCR product. In the
    procedure, universal SuperPrimers (Fs and Rs) are used to amplify all targets. The Rs primer is labeled
    with biotin for subsequent detection. Following PCR, amplicons are hybridized onto a Diatherix
    microarray in which a detection probe specific to the assay target is attached. Hybridization is followed
    by incubation with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SA-PE), which binds to the biotinylated amplicon and
    emits fluorescence upon excitation. Results for SARS-CoV-2 are reported as ‘Detected’ or ‘Not Detected’
    based on fluorescence intensity above background. The Diatherix SARS-CoV-2 assay has been validated
    to be used with the KingFisher Flex System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) utilizing
    extraction reagents from either Qiagen (ClearMag) or Omega Bio-tek (MagBind Viral DNA/RNA). RT-
    PCR reactions have been validated on and can be performed on the Applied Biosystems (ABI) GeneAmp
    9700 or the Veriti 96-well Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Postamplification hybridization
    washes are performed using a Wellwash Versa Microplate Washer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

    (Sensovation AG, Radolfzell, Germany. The RNA assays in all three laboratories have received EUA
    approval from the FDA and have excellent sensitivity, reproducibility, and reliability.
    Statistical Analysis
              All statistical analyses were performed using R software, version 3.6.0 (R Foundation, Vienna,
    Austria) for comparisons between rates, and the statistical significance of differences between groups was
    assessed using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis method. Pearson correlation analysis was also
    performed using R.

    RESULTS
              Of 985,219 subjects having NP, OP, or nasal swabs done between March 13 and September 1,
    2020 at various sites in 43 states, 10.1% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The data from 38 states in
    which at least 100 swabs were submitted for testing are presented in Table 1. When we first tabulated
    these data on June 1, 2020, New York State had by far the highest percentage of positive subjects
    (43.5%); this rate decreased to 4.6%, when we included 104,195 tests done for health screening and for
    nursing home employees who had much lower positive rates of <4.0%. When a subset of 91 subjects,
    who served as convalescent plasma donors and had been positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA based on NP
    swabs 2-4 weeks earlier, had repeat NP swabs and saliva collected, 58.6% were still positive based on NP
    swabs; but only 21.5% were positive based on saliva collection. These differences were statistically
    significant P<0.01). In our total study population, 18.2% were ≥65 years of age, of whom 6.9% were
    positive compared to 10.5% in the <65-year age group. Therefore, in the population we tested, older
    people did not have a higher positivity rate; in fact, it was lower (P<0.0001), even though it has been well
    documented that elderly subjects have a significantly higher case fatality rate than younger subjects.
              When we compared our data with CDC state-wide data, for the 38 states where we had >100
    cases/state, we noted a significant correlation for the percentage of positives (r=0.609, P<0.0001). We
    added Rhode Island to the data set because it is in the very high mortality, densely-populated northeast
    corridor of the US. As of September 1. 2020, the top ten states in the United States for cases/1 million
    were Louisiana, Mississippi, Arizona, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina, Texas, New York,
    and Iowa (Table 1). However, the top ten US states in terms of deaths/1 million were New Jersey, New
    York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Louisiana, Rhode Island, Mississippi, Arizona, Michigan, and Illinois.
    In terms of testing per 1 million, the top ten states were Rhode Island, New York, Louisiana, Connecticut,
    Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Tennessee, Michigan, and California.
              In Figure 1, we have plotted the relationship between death and case rates per million by state
    (Panel A). These data are based on 19,898 cases/1 million and 593 deaths/1million in the US as of
    September 1, 2020, as well as 271,637 tests/1 million in the US population. As can be clearly seen in
                                                                                                                                       9

    Figure 1, the northeastern states of New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island
    (red circles) had the highest death rates per case, while the southern states (orange circles) of Louisiana,
    Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia, and one western state Arizona had higher case rates, but generally
    much lower mortality rates. Western states (blue circles), especially Oregon, Wyoming, Washington,
    Colorado, Utah, and California, had the lowest mortality rates and also relatively low case rates. The
    overall correlation between deaths/1 million and cases/1million was 0.473 (P<0.0001). In Panel B, we
    plotted tests/1 million versus cases/1 million, and here we see a similar positive relationship with a
    correlation coefficient of 0.398 (P<0.0001). Clearly higher testing rates are not associated with lower case
    rates, but in fact, with higher case rates. Louisiana had the highest case rate as well as a high testing rate,
    while the converse was true for Oregon. Overall, the highest testing rates were observed in Rhode Island,
    New York, and Louisiana, all states with among the highest case rates.
              We carried out a similar analysis for all countries in the world with populations >50 million, as
    well as other selected countries. This analysis included 47 countries. Of these, 3 countries were in Asia
    and Oceania; 11 countries were in Europe; 5 countries were in North America; 7 countries were in South
    America; 7 countries were in the Middle East; and 4 countries were in Africa (Table 2). As for US states,
    we also plotted these relationships in Panel A and B of Figure 2. The correlations between cases/1 million
    and deaths/1 million were similar to US states at 0.488 (P<0.0001), as were the correlations between
    cases/1 million and tests/1 million at 0.395 (P<0.0001). However, these relationships had to be plotted on
    log scales instead of linear scales because of the very large variability in rates between countries.

    populous Asian countries (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the Philippines) had intermediate case rates,
    as well as fairly low death and testing rates. Similar relationships between case rates and testing rates
    were observed. As for US states, high testing rates were generally associated with high case rates.

    DISCUSSION
              The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection has been in large part due to its very contagious
    nature and the fact that many infected people are asymptomatic. Although the pandemic started in China,
    its spread there as well as in other countries in Asia, such as Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, South
    Korea, and Japan, has been quite well controlled. In these countries case rates have been <100/1
    million and death rates have been <10/1 million. One cannot attribute this excellent infection control
    to testing, but rather to excellent public health measures including isolation of cases, contact tracing,
    social distancing, and the wearing of face masks. It is interesting that even in countries such as India,
    Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Australia, all with >1,000 cases/1 million, death rates have been
    <60/1 million. In contrast, subjects in Europe, North America, and South America have fared far
    worse with case rates generally >5,000/1 million and death rates >500/1 million, despite a large
    amount of testing. In the northeastern and southern US states, case rates have generally exceeded
    15,000/1 million; and death rates have been >1,000/1 million, despite a lot of testing.
              Rates in the United States (19,898 cases and 593 deaths per million) and Brazil (19,919 cases
    and 609 deaths per million) were comparable in cases and deaths, due to limited public health
    measures. In contrast, Japan (579 cases and 11 deaths per million), South Korea (430 cases and 7
    deaths per million), China (59 cases and 3 deaths per million), and Thailand (50 cases and < 1 death
    per million) had much lower rates, presumably due to significantly better public health measures.
    Many European countries had case rates lower than the United States, but comparable death rates. The
    importance of public health measures may best be exemplified by comparing Sweden, which did not
    introduce such measures, to its neighbors Norway and Finland, which did introduce such measures.
    Sweden had case and death rates of 8,555/1 million and 578/1 million, respectively, while Norway and
    Finland had case and death rates of <2,500/1 million and <65/1 million, respectively. These great
    differences occurred despite the fact that these countries had fairly equivalent testing rates.
              There may be some other potential causes of the large variability in case and death rates between
    countries. One such possibility is mutations in the virus. The D614G amino acid substitution in the S

    glycoprotein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 S gene has been reported to result in a form of the virus that is
    more infective and virulent than the original Wuhan strain.9-13 This variant has been found in over 90% of
    United States strains. Another possibility is human genetic variation. Genome-wide association studies
    have identified a 3p21.31 DNA locus as being associated with a significant 1.77-fold increased risk for
    respiratory failure in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.14 This genetic variant, apparently inherited from
    Neanderthals, is not present in subjects indigenous to China, Japan, or Sub-Saharan Africa, and has a
    frequency of ~5‒8% in North America and western Europe and ~20% in India.15 Therefore, both viral and
    human genetic variation may play a role in country differences with regard to SARS-CoV-2 cases and
    mortality rates.
              Recently, there has been a significant increase in SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing in the United States in
    an effort to control the pandemic in the absence of vaccines. There have also been efforts to find easier
    ways to carry out such testing. Despite data from Yale New Haven Medical Center indicating that self-
    collected saliva samples yielded similar or better results than did NP swabs in terms of detecting SARS-
    CoV-2 positive hospitalized patients based on 44 paired samples, our data in previously positive
    outpatients did not support these findings. Our data indicated that saliva analysis only found about half as
    many positive cases than did NP swab analysis. Moreover, data has indicated that rapid antigen testing for
    SARS-CoV-2 protein is not nearly as sensitive or accurate as RNA testing. Our overall data strongly
    supports the benefits of public health measures in preventing spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our view
    the major reason for the very high cases and mortality rates in the United States has been the consistent
    lack of such measures, due to failures of government and public agency leadership.

    CONCLUSIONS
              Our data indicate that 1) outpatient saliva testing is not as sensitive as NP testing in detecting
    SARS-CoV-2 RNA; 2) the marked variability in the case and death rates between states and countries is
    due mainly to differences in public health measures; 3) variation in SARS-CoV-2 genetics and human
    genetics may also play a role in such differences; and 4) these difference are least likely to be due to lack
    of adequate testing.
