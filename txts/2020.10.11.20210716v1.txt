43      Abstract
44      Concentrations of circulating adipokines in non-obese polycystic ovary syndrome
45      (PCOS) patients had been reported in many researches, however, these results were
46      conflicting. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess whether the levels of
47      circulating adipokines were changed in non-obese PCOS. To identify eligible studies,
48      literature research was performed in the database of PubMed, Embase, Web of
49      Science without the restriction of region, publication or language. Of the total studies
50      found, only 81 met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that circulating
51      levels of adiponectin [-0.95 (95% CI, -1.36 to -0.53)] decreased statistically in
52      non-obese PCOS women. On the contrary, circulating levels of chemerin [1.13 (95%
53      CI, 0.08 to 2.18)], leptin [0.47 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.81)], resistin [0.45 (95% CI, 0.03 to
54      0.88)] and visfatin [1.38 (95% CI, 0.68 to 2.09)] increased significantly in non-obese
55      PCOS females. Besides, there was no statistically significant change in the circulating
56      levels of apelin [0.32 (95% CI, -1.34 to 1.99), irisin [1.01(95% CI, -0.68 to 2.70),
57      omentin [-0.37(95% CI, -1.05 to 0.31)] and vaspin [0.09(95% CI, -0.14 to 0.32)] in
58      non-obese PCOS patients. Scientific evidence suggested that the levels of circulating
59      adipokines altered in non-obese PCOS patients compared with controls. Independent
60      of the degree of obesity, the abnormal change of circulating adipokines levels might
61      play an important role in the occurrence and development of PCOS.

 74        1.Introduction
 75           PCOS is a common endocrine and metabolic disease ,which affects nearly affects
 76      6%-10% of reproductive-aged women according different criteria1. PCOS is
 77      diagnosed by sparse ovulation or anovulation, hyperandrogenism or/and polycystic
 78      ovaries2. Current studies have proved that the obesity rate of PCOS patients is
 79      significantly increased, which suggests that obesity may be related to the occurrence
 80      and symptoms of PCOS3.
 81            Fat tissue, which we often think of as a storage site for energy, is a crucial
 82      endocrine tissue in the body4. Adipokine is an active hormone and factor secreted by
 83      adipocytes, including adiponectin, leptin, omentin, etc. These hormones and factors
 84      secreted by adipose tissue are involved in many critical physiological processes in the
 85      body. Therefore, abnormal changes in adipokines may also lead to some endocrine
 86      diseases in the body5. Besides, studies have shown that adipokines play an essential
 87      role in the pathogenesis of obesity and obesity-related diseases6.
 88            PCOS patients are likely to have metabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes,
 89      IR (insulin resistance), and adipose tissue dysfunction 7-9. While IR affects about 10%
 90      to 25% of the general population, compared with two to three times the risk in PCOS
 91      patients 10, 11. The incidence of obesity is increased in patients with PCOS [RR (95 CI):
 92      2.77 (1.88, 4.10)] compared with patients without PCOS12. And the symptoms in
 93      PCOS patients who combined with obesity aggravates significantly. However, up to
 94      now, the mechanism of PCOS has not been determined.
 95            Dysfunction of adipose tissue can lead to changes in adipokine levels13. Many
 96      studies have proved that there are changes in adipokines levels in obese PCOS
 97      patients, indicating that adipokines play a role in obese PCOS patients14, 15. But so far,
 98      studies on adipokines levels in non-obese PCOS patients have been inconsistent.
 99      Moreover, it is not known whether the changes of adipokines are related to PCOS
100      directly or obesity or both. Thus, we aimed to perform this systematic review and
101      meta- analysis to evaluate the levels of different kinds of adipokines in non-obese
102      PCOS women.

111      2.Materials and Methods
112      2.1. Search Strategy
113            This systematic review and meta-analysis were designed according to the
114      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
115      statement16 and Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
116      (MOOSE)17.
117      2.2. Eligibility Criteria
118      Studies defining PCOS conforming to the Rotterdam Criteria or other compatible
119      criteria were included. (2) Studies designed about obese women with PCOS were
120      excluded from the study. (3) Reviews, non-human studied and conference
121      proceedings were excluded. (4) Studies without control groups were also excluded. (5)
122      Studies without extractable data(not provided as mean±SD) were excluded.
123      2.3. Information Sources
124            To identify eligible studies, exhaustive literature was performed in the
125      electronic database of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science without the restriction of
126      region, publication or language. All articles published before July 2019 was
127      considered for eligibility.
128      2.4. Search Terms
129            The search strategy involved the identification of all possible studies using
130      combinations of the following keywords:( “adiponectin,” or “apM-1 Protein,” or
131      “ACRP30 Protein,” ; “ apelin,” ; “ chemerin,” or “TIG2 protein,” ; “ irisin,” or
132      “FRCP2 protein,” ; “ leptin,” or “Obese Protein,” ; “omentin,” or “intelectin 1,” ;
133      “resistin,” ; “vaspin,” or “SERPINA12 protein,”; “visfatin,” or “NAMPT Protein,”)
134      and (“Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,” “PCOS,” ). Data on the levels of adiponectin,
135      apelin, chemerin, irisin, leptin, omentin, resistin, vaspin, visfatin was extracted.
136      2.5. Data Extraction
137            Two reviewers reviewed all the literature searched and determined whether they
138      met the inclusion criteria independently. Discrepant opinions between the two
139      reviewers were resolved by discussion and consultation with a third reviewer, if
140      necessary. The following information will be obtained from the literature: General
141      study characteristics (name of the first author, year of publication, study location),
142      Age and BMI (body mass index) of participants and summary of conclusions of the
143      study. We used the available data for our analysis.
144      2.6. Quality Assessment
145             We used Cochrane Collaboration’s tool to assess the quality of studies
146      included. Seven domains were evaluated by this tool, including random
147      sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and
148      personnel, outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting,
149      and other biases. Each indicator has three levels: high risk, low risk and
150      unknown risk. Each indicator was evaluated separately by two reviewers and
151      the differences encountered in the process were unified by discussion. The
152      possibility of publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel

153      plot and egger’s test.
154      2.7. Statistical Analysis
155             The software of Review Manager Version 5.3 was used to perform the
156      effects by meta-analysis and to construct forest plot. The expected outcome of
157      each study was a difference in average adipokines levels between PCOS
158      patients and healthy controls. Due to the different measurement methods for
159      each study, Review Manager was used to calculate the standard mean
160      difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals. The Cochran’s
161      chi-square-based Q statistic test and the I2 test were calculated to assess
162      potential heterogeneity between the individual studies. According to
163      significant heterogeneity, moderate heterogeneity and low heterogeneity, we
164      selected a random effect model and a fixed effect model respectively.
165      STATA15.0 version was used for egger’s test to check publication bias and
166      trim-and-fill method. The t value was used to determine whether there was
167      publication bias. When t value ≥0.05, it was considered that there might be no
168      publication bias.
169      3.Result
170      3.1. Study Selection
171            Our search strategy identified 1540 potential articles. One thousand two hundred
172      fifty-six studies were excluded after screening based on title or abstract, and 284
173      potentially relevant studies were assessed by reviewing the full-text article. Among
174      these studies, 203 articles were excluded from the meta-analysis and systematic
175      review owing to lack of control groups or obese subjects. Since data in some articles
176      did not present as Mean ± SD, we continued to exclude 10 articles. Finally, 71 studies
177      including 2495 subjects with PCOS and 2520 controls met our inclusion criteria for
178      the meta-analysis. Figure 1 presents the search strategy for study selection.
179      3.2. Characteristics of Included Studies
180           The features of the included literature were presented in Table1. Among the 81
181      included studies, there are several diagnostic criteria for PCOS: The Rotterdam
182      Criteria were adopted in fifty-three articles; The ESHRE/ASRM consensus had been
183      used in three articles; Nine of the articles used the NIH Criteria; Two article used the
184      Criteria of National Institute of Child Health and Human Disease; Other articles
185      adopted some of the specific standards mentioned in the article. The included studies
186      covered twenty-six countries :There were eight articles from China; Two from Saudi
187      Arabia; nineteen studies from Turkey; One study from Croatia; One article from
188      Netherlands; one article from Pakistan; One article from Denmark; Three articles
189      from India; Four studies from Iran; Three studies from South Korea; Three articles
190      from Taiwan; One studies were based in France; One article was based in the United
191      States; Four articles were based on research in Egypt; seven articles on Greece; Four
192      articles from Italy; one article from Israel; one article from Indonesia; Eight articles
193      were written in Poland; one article from Iraq; In addition to one article in Germany;
194      Brazil contributed two articles; an article from Japan; one article from Australia;
195      eventually there were one articles from Spain and one article from Qatar. The subjects
196      included in the study ranged in age from youth to old age. One criterion for obesity

197      was BMI greater than or equal to 30.0, so the studies we included had a BMI lower
198      than 30.0. The Table1 also briefly listed the primary conclusions of each article.
199      3.3. The relationship between different kinds of adipokines levels and PCOS
200            Thirty studies reported the level of adiponectin in non-obese PCOS women as
201      illustrated in Figure 2A which showed the forest plot of those studies; there was
202      significant heterogeneity among studies (I-squared = 95%, p<0.00001). Overall,
203      PCOS was associated with a change in adiponectin level of −0.95 (95% CI, −1.36 to
204      −0.53; P < 0.00001; n = 30 studies, 2565 participants).
205            The four trials (n = 254 participants) focused on levels of apelin in non-obese
206      PCOS patients. However, no significant difference was noted between PCOS and
207      circulating apelin [0.32 (95% CI, −1.34 to 1.99; P = 0.70]. The forest plot of those
208      studies was shown in Figure 2B.
209            Five individual studies were included to compare the levels of chemerin between
210      PCOS and controls. The meta-analysis showed an increased level of 1.13 (95% CI =
211      0.08 to 2.18; P = 0.03; Figure 2C). There was significant heterogeneity among these
212      studies (I2 = 96%).
213            Four studies reported the level of irisin in non-obese PCOS patients as illustrated
214      in Figure 2D which showed the forest plot of those studies; there was significant
215      heterogeneity among studies (I-squared = 97%, P<0.00001). Overall, PCOS show no
216      correlation with circulating irisin levels of 1.01 (95% CI, -0.68 to 2.70; P = 0.24; n =
217      4 studies, 282 participants).
218           The twenty-five trials (n = 2148 participants) focusing on levels of leptin in
219      non-obese PCOS patients found a statistically increase level of 0.47 (95% CI, 0.13 to
220      0.81; P = 0.007). The forest plot of those studies was showed in Figure 3A.
221            Five individual studies were included to compare the levels of omentin between
222      non-obese PCOS patients and controls. The meta-analysis showed the equal level of
223      omentin [-0.37 (95% CI = -1.05 to 0.31; P = 0.29; Figure 3B)]. There was significant
224      heterogeneity among these studies (I2 = 89%).
225            Eighteen studies reported the level of resistin in non-obese PCOS women as
226      illustrated in Figure 3C which showed the forest plot of those studies; there was
227      significant heterogeneity among studies (I-squared = 91%, P<0.00001). Overall,
228      PCOS was associated with an increase in resistin level of 0.45 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.88;
229      P = 0.03; n = 28 studies, 1223 participants).
230           The three trials (n = 348 participants) focusing on levels of vaspin in patients with
231      PCOS found a nonsignificant change level of 0.09 (95% CI, -0.14 to 0.32; P = 0.43).
232      The forest plots of those studies were showed in Figure 4A.
233           Twenty-six individual studies were included to compare the level of visfatin
234      between PCOS group and controls. The meta-analysis showed an increased level of
235      1.38 (95% CI = 0.68 - 2.09; P = 0.0001; Figure 4B). There was significant
236      heterogeneity among these studies (I2 = 96%).
237      3.4. Publication Bias
238            Funnel plot method was used to detect publication bias and Egger's test was used
239      to quantify publication bias. The shape of the funnel plot did not reveal any obvious
240      asymmetry in adiponectin, resistin. However, it seemed that the funnel plot of leptin

                                                                    7
241      and visfatin showed publication bias observably (Figure5A.5B.5C.5D). Egger’s test
242      was used to provide statistical evidence of funnel plot symmetry. The results still did
243      not suggest any evidence of publication bias in adiponectin and leptin. Egger’s test
244      showed there was possible publication bias among studies in resistin and visfatin
245      (Table 2). We used the trim-and-fill method to recalculate our pooled risk estimate of
246      resistin and visfatin. Meta-trim showed that corrected SMD (standard mean difference)
247      was not differ from uncorrected SMD, which suggested that publication bias had a
248      small effect on the final result. We did not assess the publication bias for apelin,
249      chemerin, irisin, omentin and vaspin based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
250      Reviews of Interventions (www.cochranehandbook.org), which stated that the test for
251      publication bias yields unreliable results when less than ten studies were included in a
252      meta-analysis.

254      4.Discussion
255            To our knowledge, this was the first systematic review and meta-analysis aimed
256      at quantifying the levels of nine kinds of adipokines in non-obese PCOS patients. This
257      systematic review and meta-analysis, including 81 studies demonstrated that
258      non-obese PCOS women showed a decreasing level of adiponectin and the increased
259      levels of leptin, visfatin, chemerin and resistin respectively. Our results indicated that
260      the concentration of common adipokines in plasma or serum changed remarkably in
261      non-obese PCOS women.
262            Over the past decade, a large number of studies had investigated the levels of
263      circulating adipokines in non-obese PCOS patients. Since the levels of adipokines
264      differed from the geographic regions, ethnicity or age, the results of studies were
265      inconsistent. For example, one Mahmoud A’s paper showed lower levels of
266      adipokines in PCOS patients than in the control group18 whereas an Arikan’s paper
267      showed the opposite result19. The purpose of meta-analysis was to integrate these
268      results for statistical analysis. Combining the findings of these studies was an
269      attractive option to enhance the credibility of the evidence20. Therefore, we performed
270      a meta-analysis to reach a reliable conclusion on the changes of adipokines
271      concentration in non-obese PCOS patients.
272            Considering that studies had shown the levels of adipokines was related to BMI
273      21
            and there was evidence that PCOS patients had an increased BMI22, so the change
274      in adipokines levels might be caused by obesity rather than the PCOS itself. In this
275      meta-analysis, we only included the study on non-obese PCOS patients, so we could
276      exclude the influence of obesity and directly analyzed the relationship between PCOS
277      and adipokine levels.
278            Understanding the disturbance of adipokines levels in non-obese PCOS patients
279      help to explain the pathophysiology and symptoms of PCOS:(1). Hyperandrogenism: the
280      occurrence of PCOS was closely related to hyperandrogenism23. Animal studies had
281      shown that impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose intolerance in mice (selectively
282      knocked down androgen receptors in adipocytes) were not related to obesity. Besides,
283      it was related to the changes of adipokines levels. Therefore, it could be presumed that

                                                                    8
284      the AR (androgen receptor) in fat cells can control insulin sensitivity and glucose
285      tolerance independently of obesity and affect adipokines levels in the meanwhile24. In
286      non-obese PCOS patients, androgen hypersecretion and androgen receptor
287      dysfunction were the main symptoms, which might lead to the changes in adipokines
288      levels25. Meanwhile, some studies had shown that gender had a certain influence on
289      the levels of adipokines in the body, so the increase of androgens in PCOS patients
290      might lead to the change of the levels of adipokines in the body26. (2). IR: there was
291      the evidence that the occurrence of PCOS was closely related to IR27. In vitro studies
292      had shown that in vitro fat cells, certain adipokines activate protein kinases that
293      increased insulin-mediated glucose transport, thus increasing insulin sensitivity
294      through specific pathways, such as omentin28. Meanwhile, some studies had shown
295      the expression of proinsulin mRNA was inhibited by leptin in high level, which led to
296      the decreased transcription activity of insulin gene promoter and the inhibited
297      phosphorylation of insulin receptor matrix in peripheral tissues29, 30. These studies
298      suggested that IR might affect adipokines levels by increasing insulin levels. High
299      leptin level could lead to IR in non-obese PCOS patients in the following possible
300      ways: inhibition of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase inhibited hepatic glucose
301      oxidation and increased hepatic glycogen reserve; deposit of fat in skeletal muscle
302      cells; breakdown of fat and the production of FFA (free fatty acids); direct inhibition
303      of basal insulin secretion and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, the
304      insulin sensitizer thiazolidinedione could up-regulate the expression of adiponectin
305      gene and promote the differentiation and apoptosis of adipocytes, thus reducing IR.
306      Therefore, we inferred that disorders of adipokines levels played an important role in
307      IR of non-obese PCOS patients. We might be able to treat PCOS with drugs that
308      correct the disorder of adipokines levels. (3). Chronic inflammation: Chemerin,
309      identified as an inflammatory factor at first, was thought to promote chemotaxis of
310      immature dendritic cells and macrophages through its receptor CMKLR131. CMKLR1
311      had been found to be expressed in many immune cells, including immature dendritic
312      cells, myeloid dendritic cells, macrophages and natural killer cells32, 33. This meant
313      that chemerin and its receptor CMKLR1 were involved in the recruitment of different
314      immune cells to the site of injury, and might affect the occurrence and development of
315      inflammation. Adipokines and their receptors were elevated in many inflammatory
316      states, suggesting that adipokines levels might be predictors of PCOS. Omentin had
317      anti-inflammatory, anti-cardiovascular and anti-diabetic effects. Considering that
318      obesity was a chronic low-grade inflammatory disease, long-term inflammatory
319      stimulation might be one of the reasons for omentin's down-regulated expression. 34,
320      35
           .
321            In the long run, non-obese PCOS patients with disturbance of adipokine levels
322      might lead to more related diseases, such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, type
323      2 diabetes, etc36. Type 2 diabetes was almost 10 times more common in PCOS
324      patients than in the normal population, and glucose intolerance was 30% to 50%
325      higher in obese PCOS patients37. PCOS in the future risk of cardiovascular disease
326      (CVD) should not be ignored. PCOS was also closely related to IR, which could lead
327      to a variety of cardiac metabolic abnormalities (such as dyslipidemia, high blood

328      pressure, glucose intolerance, diabetes and metabolic syndrome) that increased the
329      risk of cardiovascular disease in women38.
330            Therefore, adipokines levels were of great significance in the diagnosis and
331      treatment of PCOS, and people should improve their understanding of abnormal
332      changes in adipokines levels. Metformin might alleviate corresponding symptoms and
333      treat PCOS by correcting abnormal levels of certain adipokines. For example, it could
334      reduce the levels of resistin, visfatin, irisin, chemerin and so on39-42. A recent report
335      suggested that insulin and glucose affected the secretion of visfatin through
336      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B pathway43. Metformin could
337      increase the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin which help to reduce the
338      hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance in PCOS patients. In the above ways,
339      metformin could alleviate the abnormal change of visfatin level. Moreover,
340      adipokines and hyperandrogenemia formed a vicious cycle of endocrine metabolism,
341      promoting the risk of PCOS and other related endocrine diseases. Metformin could
342      also relieve the symptoms of PCOS patients by reducing their high testosterone levels
343      through specific mechanisms44. We presumed that metformin might be used to correct
344      the disorder of adipokine levels and thus to treat PCOS, but more experiments are
345      needed to prove.
346            Statistically, significant heterogeneity was found in the analysis of adiponectin,
347      apelin, chemerin, irisin, leptin, omentin, resistin, visfatin might reflect the clinical
348      heterogeneity and PCOS diagnostic criteria, different ethnic backgrounds, national
349      setting, age, or BMI. In addition, the BMI to determine obesity was different. This
350      suggested that caution should be exercised in extrapolating these results to more
351      extensive applications. However, the analysis of apelin showed no heterogeneity,
352      indicating that the included pieces of literature were homogeneous, and the study
353      results were accurate. Second, we found evidence of publication bias. Although a
354      trim-and-fill method suggested that unpublished trials might not influence the levels
355      of resistin and visfatin in non-obese patients with PCOS, these results should be
356      interpreted carefully.
357            Our literature search was comprehensive, and we did not apply any restrictions
358      on language to limit our ability to assess the relationship between the levels of
359      adipokines and PCOS. However, our meta-analysis still had some limitations. First of
360      all, there were many different test methods for the identification of PCOS, so the
361      diagnose of PCOS had heterogeneity. In addition, changes in adipokines levels in
362      normal weight or overweight PCOS patients were studied in this study, but we could
363      not entirely exclude all obese participants in the included study due to the different
364      criteria. Finally, there were many different methods to determine the levels of
365      adipokine in the blood, which may lead to some deviation. Despite these limitations,
366      the present meta-analysis had increased the statistical power by pooling the results of
367      single studies. Therefore, the total number of subjects was sufficiently large to support
368      our conclusion.
369            In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that the
370      levels of circulating adipokines in non-obese PCOS patients with was changed to
371      varying degrees, which help to find potential pathogenesis and new biochemical

372      diagnostic criteria of PCOS. Moreover, this result might provide a new scheme to
373      treat PCOS by correcting disturbance of adipokines levels. However, further studies
374      were needed to explore the potential mechanism of the disturbance and focus on
375      whether the PCOS could be treated by correcting the levels of adipokines.
