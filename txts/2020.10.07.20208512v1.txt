    ABSTRACT
    An effective and widely used vaccine could reduce the burden of dengue
    virus (DENV) around the world. DENV is endemic in Puerto Rico, where the
    dengue vaccine CYD-TDV is currently under consideration as a control
    measure. CYD-TDV has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in vaccinees
    who had prior dengue infection. However, in vaccinees who had no prior
    dengue infection, the vaccine had a modestly elevated risk of hospitalization
    and severe disease. The WHO therefore recommended a strategy of pre-
    vaccination screening and vaccination of seropositive persons. To estimate
    the cost-effectiveness and benefits of this intervention (i.e., screening and
    vaccination of seropositive persons) in Puerto Rico, we simulated 10 years of
    the intervention in 9-year-olds using an agent-based model. Across the entire
    population, we found that 5.5% (4.6%-6.3%) of dengue hospitalizations could
    be averted. However, we also found that 1.6 (1.3 - 2.1) additional
    hospitalizations could occur for every 1,000 DENV-naïve children who were
    vaccinated following a false-positive test results for prior exposure. The ratio
    of the averted hospitalizations among all vaccinees to additional
    hospitalizations among DENV-naïve vaccinees was estimated to be 19 (13-

    24). At a base case cost of vaccination of 382 USD, we found an incremental
    cost-effectiveness ratio of 122,000 USD per QALY gained. Our estimates can
    provide information for considerations to introduce the CYD-TDV vaccine in
    Puerto Rico.
    INTRODUCTION
    Dengue is considered one of the most important mosquito-borne viral
    diseases affecting humans, with half the world’s population living in areas at
    risk [1,2]. Dengue virus (DENV) has been estimated to infect between 100 to
    390 million individuals per year. Between 51 to 96 million of these infections
    result in disease episodes [1,3]. This disease has been of great concern in
    Latin America, which had a record number of dengue cases in 2019, with 2.7
    million cases and 1,200 deaths reported to health systems [4]. In the
    absence of an effective vaccine against dengue, vector control has been the
    primary intervention available to reduce virus spread, but the evidence for
    the effectiveness of vector control to sustainably reduce dengue incidence is
    limited [5].
             Currently, one dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) is available and other
    vaccine candidates are in efficacy trials [6,7]. Recent analyses of CYD-TDV
    vaccine trials showed an increased risk of severe dengue upon subsequent
    natural infection among vaccinees without previous exposure to dengue
    virus [8]. In light of this finding, the World Health Organization (WHO)
    recommends pre-vaccination screening to help ensure that only those with
    previous exposure (DENV-exposed) are vaccinated [9]. The United States
    Food and Drug Administration licensed CYD-TDV for children 9-16 years
    living in dengue endemic areas and with documented evidence of previous
    dengue infection [10]. The requirement of a pre-vaccination laboratory
    screening for prior dengue infection complicates cost-effectiveness and
    logistical considerations for vaccine program. The quality of pre-vaccination
    screening tests is also a critical consideration because test specificity can
                                                                      2

    affect the number of false positive test results and because vaccinating a
    child with a false positive screeening test result can put the child at risk for
    more severe dengue illness if infected. It is important therefore to estimate
    the potential health and economic benefits and risks of using CYD-TDV when
    paired with a pre-vaccination screening strategy.
             Several studies have suggested that pre-vaccination screening with
    CYD-TDV could be cost-effective in some settings [11–14], but high
    specificity of screening is required to minimize individual risk, as well as high
    sensitivity to maximize population benefits [15]. Pre-vaccination screening is
    also recommended in Latin America [16]. The health benefits and cost-
    effectiveness of pre-vaccination screening for the Philippines and Brazil have
    been investigated in a recent study [12]. That analysis showed likely reduced
    disease incidence with limited adverse events at acceptable costs from this
    intervention with pre-vaccination screening and subsequent vaccination with
    CYD-TDV in areas with moderate to high-transmission intensity. Dengue is
    also endemic to several tropical and sub-tropical jurisdictions associated with
    the United States, including Puerto Rico [17]. A program of pre-vaccination
    screening coupled with CYD-TDV given to seropositive individuals is currently
    being considered to reduce the burden of dengue in Puerto Rico [18]. In this
    study, we evaluate the epidemiological and economic impacts of pre-
    vaccination screening and subsequent vaccination with CYD-TDV in Puerto
    Rico.
    METHODS
    We estimated the epidemiological benefits and cost-effectiveness of the
    intervention over a 10-year time-frame. We based this study on a previous
    analysis of the impact of this intervention in various transmission settings
    [12,19], and we adjusted transmission parameters and costs to represent
    Puerto Rico.

    Agent-Based Model
    To evaluate the impact of a pre-vaccination screening intervention in Puerto
    Rico, we modified an agent-based model of dengue transmission with
    humans and mosquitoes represented as agents. This model has been
    described in previous publications [12,19,20]. While our model has been
    calibrated to demographic and geographic data from Iquitos, Peru [20], the
    model can represent DENV transmission in a generic setting [19] and has
    been modified in this study to simulate DENV transmission dynamics in
    Puerto Rico. Our model compares two strategies, an intervention strategy
    and the status quo. The intervention strategy is the routine pre-vaccination
    screening and subsequent vaccination of seropositive of 9-year-olds in
    Puerto Rico. Nine-year-olds is the lowest age approved for vaccination, and
    has been used as a default age of vaccination in other studies [12,19]. For
    each of the strategies, the model population was followed for 10 years,
    keeping track of dengue-related health events defined as dengue infections,
    hospitalizations, and deaths.
    Model parameterization for Puerto Rico (                                            9)
    We modified the transmission parameters of the model to approximate DENV
    transmission dynamics of DENV in Puerto Rico. We adjusted the transmission
    intensity of DENV in our model to achieve the expected age-specific dengue
    antibody prevalence levels (                           9)  in Puerto Rico. We estimated the                               9  for
    Puerto Rico based on two serological studies. Coudeville et al. [21] estimated
    50% seroprevalence in 9-year-olds in areas where the CYD-TDV phase-3
    trials were conducted. Argüello et al. found that 49.8% (95% CI = 43.6-56.0%)
    of participants between 10-18 years of age had a positive IgG anti-DENV
    antibodies [22]. We assumed a baseline of                                      9  = 0.5. Given the uncertainty
    on these estimates, we explored a lower value of                                          9  = 0.3, and an upper
    value of             9  = 0.6 to assess the sensitivity of our estimates to changes in
    the intensity of transmission in Puerto Rico.

             Individuals can be infected with DENV many times over the course of
    their life. Evidence suggests the second infection can cause a
    disproportionate level of disease severity, relative to the first infection or to
    the third or later infections. In the model, the effect of a vaccination on an
    individual is similar to a natural infection without symptoms (silent infection),
    which is consistent with assumptions in other models [13,14,19,23]. If the
    individual is DENV-naïve, then a vaccination serves as the individual’s first (a
    silent) infection, and a subsequent infection may be more severe. By
    contrast, if the individual is DENV-exposed, then a vaccination serves as the
    individual’s second or later (silent) infection, which does not result in
    additional risk for severe disease. These assumptions are supported by
    empirical evidence that seronegative individuals vaccinated with CYD-TDV
    have a higher risk of hospitalization after a natural infection, compared to
    those not vaccinated [8]. Vaccine effectiveness parameters were calibrated
    to the most recent dengue vaccine trial results [8], we calibrated model
    parameters characterizing vaccine profile to vaccine trial data using a
    particle filtering approach, which is explained in more detail elsewhere ([12],
    Appendix S2). The results from the calibration step are shown in table 1 with
    the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval.
             Given the stochastic nature of our model, we simulated 3,000 paired
    replicates over the parameter ranges, and reported the smoothed output of
    these simulations using a generalized additive model (GAM) in R. The
    uncertainty on the model parameters estimated in Table 1 was taken into
    account by simulating the model over the upper and lower bound of the
    estimates of the vaccine profile parameters.
    Epidemiological outcomes
    Population-level benefits were defined as the proportion of symptomatic and
    hospitalized cases averted for the total population. Individual-level benefits
    were defined as the relative risk for symptomatic and hospitalized dengue of
    an individual child who undergoes screening and possibly vaccination
                                                                      5

    compared to a child who is not given a screening or any vaccination. Since
    misclassification by a serologic test could result in DENV-naïve individuals
    receiving a vaccination that could lead to an episode of hospitalization [8],
    we quantify the magnitude of this risk by estimating the proportion of
    additional hospitalizations that occurred in the model among misclassified
    DENV-naïve individuals who received a vaccination. We reported the number
    of hospitalizations in vaccinated DENV-naïve children per 1,000 children
    vaccinated. We also reported the ratio of averted hospitalizations among the
    total population divided by the number of additional hospitalizations among
    misclassified DENV-naïve individuals who received a vaccination. This ratio
    captures the trade-off between hospitalizations that are averted by
    vaccination and any additional hospitalizations that may be caused by the
    vaccination of misclassified DENV-naïve individuals. Higher values of this
    ratio represent better value in terms of averted hospitalizations.
             In our simulations, we assumed that coverage of the intervention (i.e.,
    serological screening and vaccination in the event of a positive result) was
    given to 80% of the target population, but evaluated an alternative scenario
    of lower coverage (50%) in the sensitivity analysis. We assumed that 100%
    of children with a positive screening result were vaccinated. The baseline
    values of sensitivity (0.8) and specificity (0.95) were based on a recent
    review of rapid diagnostic tests for determination of serostatus [24].
    However, the actual properties of serological screening may turn out to be
    different from this baseline. Assuming that increasing sensitivity would result
    in lower specificity, and vice-versa, We assumed three additional scenarios:
    1) high sensitivity (0.95) and low specificity (0.76), 2) low sensitivity (0.64)
    and high specificity (0.95), 3) high sensitivity (0.95) and high specificity
    (0.95). In a set of sensitivity analyses, we also simulated pre-vaccination
    screening over the full range of values of sensitivity and specificity (0-1) to
    find the minimum values required to achieve positive proportion of dengue
    cases averted.
                                                                      6

    Cost-effectiveness analysis
    We evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the
    intervention over a time horizon of 10 years. We used a public health
    perspective, as it has been used in previous economic analyses of the
    potential impact of routine vaccination with CYD-TDV [12,19]. We calculated
    the ICER as shown in equation 1, which compares an intervention strategy to
    a no-intervention strategy. In the denominator, three different outcome
    measures are used to quantify the effectiveness of each strategy
    (   v e nev         v  and         v − v e nev         v ): QALYs, symptomatic cases with medical
    care, and hospitalizations.
                                                   v e nev        v −           v − v e nev        v
                                                                  v−
                                      =                                                               .        (1)
                                                   v e nev                v − v e nev         v
             To evaluate the ICER, we identified a set of cost parameters. The
    baseline cost per fully vaccinated child was set to 382 USD (32 USD - 682
    USD) based on current prices of vaccines in the US (Tables S1-S4). The
    individual cost of screening was set to 30 USD, but we varied this price from
    1 USD to 60 USD in sensitivity analyses.
             Estimates of the costs paid by the government associated with
    treatment of dengue cases for ambulatory cases and hospitalizations were
    based on estimates from 2002 to 2009 (projected to 2010) in Puerto Rico
    [17]. Using the consumer price index for medical care for Puerto Rico [25],
    we adjusted these costs from 2010 values to 2019 USD. The cost of an
    ambulatory case was set to 315 USD (252 - 378) and the cost of a
    hospitalization was set to 2,132 USD (1,705 - 2,558). Future costs were
    discounted by 3% annually.
                                                                      7

             For the cost-effectiveness results, our primary health outcome was the
    quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), which is a health-related quality of life
    index that ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 with 0.0 representing a state of death and
    1.0 representing perfect health for one year. Following approaches used in
    previous studies of dengue [19,26–28], we estimated the QALYs gained from
    the intervention based on lost quality of life due to dengue fever and severe
    dengue. We used disutility parameters (D), or QALY decrements, that were
    taken from a study that estimated the quality of life associated with dengue
    fever and hospitalizations, conducted by Zeng et al. [29]. These values are
    listed in Table 2. Assuming a discount rate (r) of 3%, we estimated the QALYs,
    such that
                                                                  (1 −             , , )
                                      QALYs =                                              ,       (2)
                                                                    (1 + )
             where i is each individual in the model, j is the disease state (dengue
    fever, hospitalized dengue, or death), N is the total population in the model,
    and T is the number of years of the intervention (10 years).
             To account for utility loss associated with premature death caused by
    severe dengue, we approximated remaining lifetime QALYs based on life
    expectancy (L). Life expectancy was obtained from the demographic
    characteristics of the modeled population and varied for each individual in
    the simulation. Discounted QALYs are estimated over the remaining lifetime
    of each individual in the population using a 3% discount rate. These
    remaining lifetime QALYs were calculated as

    RESULTS
    Epidemiological outcomes
    Population-level benefits
    From a population level, our simulations showed that the intervention
    resulted in averted symptomatic cases across all four scenarios for different
    levels of sensitivity and specificity of pre-vaccination screening tests (Fig. 1,
    left panel). Estimates of the numbers of symptomatic cases and
    hospitalizations averted for each scenario of transmission intensity are
    shown in Table 3. More than 3,000 hospitalizations were averted in the
    baseline scenario and in the four scenarios that investigated different levels
    of prior exposure and pre-vaccination screening test properties (Fig. 1, right
    panel) with 5.5% (4.6% - 6.3%) of hospitalizations averted when                                                      9  = 50%,
    and 3% (2% - 3.6%) when                             9  = 30% (Fig. 1, right panel). Higher sensitivity
    (0.95) and lower specificity (0.76) resulted in lower proportions of
    hospitalizations averted. Lower sensitivity (0.64) and higher specificity (0.99)
    also lowered the proportion of hospitalizations averted to 4.7% (3.8% - 5.3%)
    when           9   = 50%, and to 2.8% (2.1% - 2.8%) when                                      9 = 30%. Finally,
    increasing both, sensitivity (0.95) and specificity (0.95), increased benefits of
    vaccination up to 6.2% (6% - 7%) in the baseline transmission scenario
    (     9 = 50%).

             A reduction of symptomatic cases was achieved under any value of
    specificity and sensitivity for the pre-vaccination screening laboratory test
    ( Fig. 2). With regard to hospitalizations, our simulations over the whole
    range of sensitivity and specificity values suggest that even with perfect
    sensitivity, the minimum value of specificity to avert hospitalized cases is 0.6
    for        9  of 30% (Fig. 2, right panel). Holding the baseline level of specificity
    (0.95) constant, we found that sensitivity values above 0.2 result in positive
    cases averted. These specificity values (0.2                                     9  = 50%, 0.6                9 = 30%)
    represent the absolute minimum test parameters needed in the model to
    avoid an increase in hospitalizations.
    Individual-level benefits
    The relative risk of becoming a symptomatic case was slightly reduced
    among vaccinated seropositive individuals, compared to individuals of the
    same age who were not given the intervention (Fig. 3, left panel). In the
    baseline scenario of sensitivity and specificity of laboratory test screening,
    the risk was around 0.85 (0.82 - 1.0) for                                  9  = 50% and around 0.9 (0.87 -
    1.0) for            9  = 30%. The relative risk of a hospitalization was also reduced to
    around 0.63 (0.3 - 1.0) for                         9  = 50% and to 0.73 (0.73 - 1.0) for                              9  =
    30% (Fig. 3, right panel).
    Magnitude of naïve children at increased risk of hospitalization due to
    vaccination
    We estimated the number of hospitalizations due to false positives of DENV-
    naïve children who were therefore vaccinated. We estimated these
    hospitalizations to be around 1.6 (1.3 - 2.1) per 1,000 vaccinees in the
    baseline scenario of sensitivity (0.8) and specificity (0.95) (                                            9  = 50%, Fig. 4,
    left panel). This number increased to almost 3 (1.9 - 3.6) cases per 1,000
    vaccinees in the lower transmission scenario. Reducing specificity to
    increase sensitivity resulted in more than double the baseline
    hospitalizations in the DENV-naïve group. In contrast, reducing sensitivity to
    increase specificity to 0.99 reduced the number of hospitalizations to about
                                                                    10

    half the baseline number. We also found that for every one additional
    hospitalization in the group of vaccinated DENV-naïve individuals there were
    about 19 (13 - 24) (                    9  = 50%) hospitalizations averted overall in the
    baseline scenario (Fig. 4, right panel). In the lower transmission setting, the
    ratio of averted hospitalizations among DENV-exposed individuals to
    additional hospitalizations among DENV-naïve individuals declined to around
    7.7 (5.5 - 9.0).
    Cost-effectiveness of the pre-vaccination screening intervention
    In the baseline scenario of costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
    (ICER) of the intervention was around 122,000 USD per QALY gained (74,000
    - 182,000) (Fig. 5, left panel). The ICER was 240,000 USD at a lower
    transmission intensity scenario (                             9 = 30%). At the minimum vaccine price
    of 32 USD, we found an ICER of 15,000 USD and 57,000 USD for the
    moderate and low transmission scenarios, respectively. In sensitivity
    analyses on vaccine cost, we find that for each additional dollar of vaccine
    cost, the ICER increased by 305 USD (                                  9 = 50%) and 520 USD
    (     9 = 30%), depending on transmission intensity. At a higher cost of
    serological screening of 60 USD, we found that the ICER increased to
    143,000 USD (                   9  = 50%) and 297,000 USD (                          9 = 30%). In terms on the
    ICER per averted symptomatic case, we estimated that the intervention
    costs around 11,000 USD to avert a symptomatic case at moderate
    transmission (Fig. 5, middle panel), and around 21,000 USD at a lower
    transmission setting. Finally, the cost to avert a hospitalized case was around
    16,000 USD for a moderate transmission scenario and around 32,000 USD at
    a lower transmission scenario (Fig. 5, right panel).
    DISCUSSION
    Using an agent-based model of dengue virus transmission, we simulated the
    impact of a routine program of pre-vaccination screening of 9-year-olds with
    subsequent vaccination of seropositive individuals, at dengue transmission
                                                                    11

    levels that were calibrated to Puerto Rico. Assuming a moderate and low
    transmission intensity (PE​                     9  = [50%, 30%]) in Puerto Rico, we found that
    this intervention could be beneficial at the population-level and less so at the
    individual-level, as long as the serological pre-vaccination screening test has
    at least moderate values of sensitivity and high specificity. In sensitivity
    analyses, we found that a minimum specificity of 0.6 for serological
    screening was required to ensure that the intervention would not result in an
    increase of hospitalizations due to vaccination of DENV-naïve individuals
    misclassified with a positive result for prior exposure. Additional
    epidemiological impact from different scenarios of transmission intensity can
    be explored in our webapp (http://denguevaccine.crc.nd.edu). In a cost-
    effectiveness analysis under our baseline assumptions, we estimated an
    ICER of around 122,000 USD per QALY gained. This value was sensitive to
    changes in the underlying transmission intensity and uncertainty in the
    accuracy and cost of serological screening, and uncertainty in vaccination
    costs.
             A sensitivity analysis showed that higher specificity would be more
    important than high sensitivity for epidemiological benefits as well as cost-
    effectiveness. This, ensuring highly specific pre-vaccination screening tests
    to minimize the number of seronegative individuals misclassified as
    seropositive is clearly important. Additional hospitalizations caused by
    vaccinating misclassified DENV-naïve children is a unique and important
    issue for the use of CYD-TDV. In our baseline scenario, our results suggest
    that for every 1,000 vaccinated children, around 2 extra cases would be
    caused (4 in a lower transmission setting). This number more than doubled
    when we adjusted the parameters of the pre-vaccination screening test,
    reducing the specificity of screening from 0.95 (with sensitivity 0.8) to 0.76
    (with sensitivity 0.95).
             We focused on a scenario where 80% of 9-year-olds were routinely
    given pre-vaccination screening and subsequent vaccination of seropositives.

    However, this level of intervention coverage (80%) may not occur in practice.
    There are many possible reasons that widespread use of pre-vaccination
    screening and any subsequent vaccinations may not be achieved. A number
    of challenges, common to many vaccines, may potentially reduce
    intervention coverage, such as: (1) the vaccine and screening tests may not
    be given a strong recommendation or endorsement from the medical
    community, (2) concerns of patients and parents over the perceived benefits
    and perceived safety of the vaccination, (3) costs of the pre-screening tests
    and vaccination, and (4) any number of logistical challenges that could occur
    with a complex intervention procedure that includes a pre-vaccination
    screening test that is potentially followed up with three doses of a
    vaccination, with each dose given approximately 6 months apart. Our results
    suggest that the cost-effectiveness could be affected by a lower uptake,
    slightly increasing the ICER, especially for QALYs gained and averted
    symptomatic cases in low transmission scenarios.
             Generally, our results are consistent with other studies that evaluated
    dengue vaccination in Puerto Rico. Some of the differences in the results
    appear to be due to differences in important assumptions. At a vaccine cost
    of 20 USD per dose (60 USD for three doses), Coudeville et al. found that,
    using the GDP per capita as a threshold for the willingness to pay for a DALY
    (Disability-Adjusted Life Year) averted, this intervention could result in cost-
    savings [13]. One important difference is that our study used a higher cost of
    vaccination in the baseline scenario. At the lower bound of vaccination cost
    assumed in our study (32 USD for three doses), the cost per QALY gained
    was between 15,000 USD and 57,000 USD. Similar results were found by
    Zeng et al., although they omitted the cost of screening [30]. Our study
    differs in the assumption of the costs of clinical care. We focused on the
    average cost paid by the government (1,615 USD) [17], the two studies
    mentioned above [13,30] used the overall direct cost of hospitalization
    (4,135 USD), which includes the cost paid by insurance, households, and
                                                                    13

    employers. While these could account for some differences between the
    results of our studies, our sensitivity analyses suggest that changes to health
    care costs would only modestly affect the ICER estimates. At the base case
    of vaccine cost of 382 USD, dengue vaccination was estimated to cost
    122,000 USD per QALY gained. Our estimate for the cost-effectiveness of
    dengue screening combined with vaccination falls within the range of
    economic values that have been estimated for some of the other adolescent
    vaccines in the United States [31]. For example, the cost per QALY gained for
    influenza vaccination of adolescents 12-17 years who are not at high risk was
    119,000 in 2006 USD [31].
             Although our model has been carefully parameterized our approach
    has some limitations. First, we did not explicitly simulate demographic
    characteristics of Puerto Rico. Instead, we parameterized our model to
    represent generic settings of transmission intensity with a demographic
    structure appropriate to Iquitos, Peru. The assumption of similar age-
    structures can result in some differences in transmission patterns.
    Nonetheless, in previous analyses with this model, our approach showed
    similar projections on the impact of dengue vaccination to seven other
    models [19]. Another limitation of our model is that we are simulating
    homogeneous circulation of DENV serotypes. Although this assumption is
    unrealistic, given that dengue outbreaks are characterized by the dominance
    of one of the serotypes, it would be unfeasible to make projections of the
    serotype-specific DENV importations for the next ten years. In our baseline
    parameter for the cost of a vaccinated child, we did not explicitly include
    some factors such as transportation costs for the child and a caregiver, and
    storage and distribution of vaccine materials. These additional factors would
    likely serve to increase the cost per capita of a fully vaccinated child relative
    to our baseline assumption, which is the reason for the extensive sensitivity
    analyses included around vaccine costs and for the relative broad ranges
    applied to this parameter.
                                                                    14

             In summary, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of serologic
    screening and subsequent vaccination on the range of 74,000 to 182,000
    USD per QALY, with a range dependent on assumptions about background
    prevalence, vaccine cost, and other factors. Model results comport
    reasonably well with other epidemiological models and with other estimates
    of economic value. Our analysis suggests that epidemiological benefits can
    be achieved from this intervention in Puerto Rico for the baseline
    assumptions of sensitivity and specificity. If multiple diagnostic tests were to
    be available, the specificity of the test should be prioritized given that it is
    crucial to minimize the additional hospitalizations in vaccinees without
    previous exposure to DENV. In conclusion, decision makers in Puerto Rico
    considering the implementation of this vaccine need to contemplate the
    potential benefits and risks of the intervention at the individual and
    population level. Our detailed computational model can provide relevant
    information that can be used to support decision making.

    routine pre-vaccination screening and subsequent vaccination in the event of
    positive result for 9 year-olds over 10 year time horizon.
