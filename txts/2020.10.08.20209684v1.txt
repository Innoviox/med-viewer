          Abstract
          Introduction
          Case management for COVID-19 patients is one of key interventions in country responses to the
          pandemic. Countries need information on the costs of case management to inform resource
          mobilization, planning and budgeting, purchasing arrangements, and assessments of the cost-
          effectiveness       of   interventions.     We   estimated     unit   costs    for COVID-19     case   management          for
          patients with asymptomatic, mild to moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 disease in Kenya.
          Methods
          We estimated per patient per day unit costs of COVID-19 case management for patients that are
          asymptomatic         and    those    that   have   mild   to   moderate,       severe,  and    critical   symptoms.        For
          asymptomatic and mild to moderate patients, we estimated unit costs for home-based care and
          institutional (hospitals and isolation centers). We used an ingredients approach, adopted a health
          system perspective and patient episode of care as our time horizon. We obtained data on inputs
          and their quantities from COVID-19 case management guidelines, home based care guidelines,
          and human resource guidelines, and augmented this with data provided by three public covid-19
          treatment hospitals in Kenya. We obtained input prices for services from a recent costing survey
          of 20 hospitals in Kenya and for pharmaceuticals, non-pharmaceuticals, devices and equipment
          from market price databases for Kenya.
          Results
          Per day per patient unit cost for asymptomatic patients and patients with                             mild to moderate
          COVID-19 disease under home based care are KES 1,993.01 (USD 18.89) and 1995.17 (USD 18.991)
          respectively. When these patients are managed in an isolation center of hospital, the same unit
          costs for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild to moderate disease are 7,415.28 (USD
          70.29) and 7,417.44 (USD 70.31) respectively. Per day unit costs for patients with severe COVID-19
          disease managed in general hospital wards and those with critical COVID-19 disease admitted in
          intensive care units are 12,570.75 (USD 119.16) and 59,369.42 (USD 562.79).
                                                                                                                          1|Page

          Conclusion
          COVID-19      case    management        costs    are substantial.  Unit  costs   for  asymptomatic     and   mild    to
          moderate COVID-19 patients in home-based care is 4-fold lower compared institutional care of
          the same patients. Kenya will not only need to mobilize substantial resources to finance COVID-19
          case management but also explore additional service delivery adaptations that will reduce unit
          costs.

          Background
          The   World     Health     Organization,      declared    COVID-19,  caused    by   the   severe acute   respiratory
          syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a pandemic on March 11 2020 (1). The pandemic has spread
          to almost all countries and territories worldwide, infecting millions of individuals and causing
          many    deaths      (2).  To    effectively   respond    to  the pandemic,     countries    need  to identify   cost-
          effective interventions, plan and mobilize resources to deploy these interventions in ways that
          enhance health system goals that include equitable access, efficiency, quality, and financial risk
          protection. To effectively achieve this, countries need information on the unit costs of these
          interventions.
          One such area of intervention is case management of patients that test positive for COVID-19.
          While most people with COVID-19 are either asymptomatic or develop only mild to moderate
          disease, estimates from Asia, Europe and the US show that approximately 15% develop severe
          disease that requires oxygen support and management in general hospital wards, and 5% have
          critical disease, likely to require mechanical ventilation and may develop complications such as
          respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), thromboembolism, sepsis and
          septic shock, and multi-organ failure such as cardiac and acute kidney injury (3–5). Patients with
          critical disease require intensive care unit care (4).
          Information about the unit costs for COVID-19 case management is useful in mobilizing resources
          and planning and budgeting for this intervention by policy makers. It is also useful in formulating
          appropriate       healthcare       purchasing    arrangements    by  informing     the   development    of  provider
          payment mechanisms and rates, and as estimates to parametize cost-effectiveness models to
          assess the value for money of COVID-19 interventions. In this paper, we present an analysis to
          estimate     the unit costs        for COVID-19     case management      in Kenya. Kenya has developed case
          management guidelines for COVID-19 and is pondering appropriate financing mechanisms and
          purchasing arrangements for case management as part of its health system response to                               the
          pandemic. Evidence of case management unit costs will therefore find utility in informing these
          policy decisions and could be adapted and adjusted to facilitate application in other countries
          with similar contexts.

          Methods
          Intervention description
          We costed case management for COVID-19 for four clinical severities as defined by the Kenya
          ministry of health COVID-19 case management guidelines (6). These are:
               •    Asymptomatic COVID-19 patients
               •    Covid-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms
               •    Covid-19 patients with severe symptoms
               •    COVID-19 patients in critical condition
          Kenya introduced a policy for home-based care for COVID-19 patients that are asymptomatic or
          have    mild   to   moderate       symptoms      (7). This policy is intended     to reduce      the burden   of case
          management by hospitals and isolation centers and reduce the costs of management. Patient
          eligibility criteria for home-based care are a) laboratory confirmed COVID-19 b) asymptomatic
          patients or patients with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 c) absence of co-morbidities,
          d) access to a suitable space for home-based isolation (7). The decision to adopt home-based
          care   for   a   patient     is   made   after   an   assessment   of  the   suitability    of   the patients’  home
          environment by a trained healthcare worker. Patients on home-based care are required to self-
          isolate at home and self-report symptoms daily to a healthcare provider using a mobile phone
          application (7). The patients are only transferred to a hospital if they develop severe symptoms.
          Patients that do not qualify for home-based care receive institutional care – in a hospital or an
          isolation center. We therefore costed case management for asymptomatic patients and patients
          with mild to moderate symptoms for both scenarios – home-based care and institutional care.
          According to the Kenya covid-19 case-management guidelines, patients with severe symptoms
          are admitted for inpatient general hospital care with the option of oxygen therapy when needed
          (6). Patients in critical condition are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with the option for
          mechanical ventilation when needed (6).
          Costing approach, perspective, and time horizon
          We used       an   ingredients      approach    to  costing  (8), which   entails  the    identification  of relevant
          inputs that are used to deliver COVID-19 case management, their quantities, and their monetary
          value. We costed the case management of COVID-19 patients from a health system perspective
          and used one patient episode of care as our time horizon.
                                                                                                                     4|Page

          Type of costs and unit costs estimated
          We estimated economic costs which include the monetary value of inputs whether they are
          accompanied with financial outlays or not. We estimated the following unit costs for a) Per
          patient completing treatment cost of COVID-19 case-management, and b) Per patient, per day
          cost of COVID-19 case management for the following patient categories and delivery strategies:
               1) Asymptomatic COVID-19 patients on home-based care
               2) Asymptomatic COVID-19 patients on institutional care (admitted in hospitals or isolation
                    centers)
               3) Mild to moderate symptomatic COVID-19 patients on home-based care
               4) Mild to moderate symptomatic COVID-19 patients on institutional care (admitted in
                    hospitals or isolation centers)
               5) COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms admitted in hospitals
               6) COVID-19 patients with critical disease admitted in intensive care units
          Measuring resource use
          For each of the unit costs, we costed all the direct and ancillary inputs that go into the delivery of
          the case management. Broadly, this included health facility “hotel costs” which included non-
          clinical costs of inpatient accommodation and overheads (e.g. management, electricity, water,
          infrastructure), staff time, pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceuticals patient level interventions,
          laboratory test, radiology costs, and costs for personal protective equipment (figure 1).
          Figure 1: COVID-19 Case Management Unit Costs
          We obtained data on inputs and their quantities from billing reports from 3 public health facilities
          designated as COVID-19 treatment centers, and the Kenya COVID-19 guidelines on a) case
          management (6), b) home-based care (7), and c) human resources requirements (9). These

          guidelines outlined the interventions, resources, and resource quantities that ought to be used
          for case management of COVID-19 patients in Kenya. We obtained data on input costs from
          recent primary cost data whose estimates were appropriate to the COVID-19 pattern of care,
          primary data from 3 COVID-19 public treatment healthcare centers, and market prices.
          Accommodation and overheads
          We obtained per day costs for accommodation and overheads from median costs reported in a
          cost analysis of 20 healthcare facilities in Kenya in 2018. Accommodation and overhead costs
          include costs for non-medical inputs including accommodation, management, catering, laundry
          and cleaning, electricity and water.
          Staffing
          We obtained data on the type of staff, and time spent on patients from the Kenya ministry of
          health human resource guidelines for the management of COVID-19 and from reports of actual
          staff allocation in 3 public COVID-19 treatment centers (supplementary file 1). We obtained staff
          costs from official public sector staff salaries data provided to us by county governments in
          Kenya.
          Pharmaceuticals and Non-pharmaceutical (fluids, devices etc), and personal protective equipment
          Supplementary file 1 outlines the list of medicines and non-pharmaceuticals that are used in the
          management of COVID-19 in Kenya. These were obtained from COVID-19 clinical guidelines for
          Kenya and billing information from 3 public COVID-19 treatment centers. We obtained costs for
          medical      equipment          from   market      prices  for  local  suppliers,    and     medicines,   and    non-
          pharmaceuticals from market prices reported in the 2020 Kenya drug index catalogue (10). This
          catalogue       provides       current   prices     of all available  brands     of  pharmaceuticals       and   non-
          pharmaceuticals in Kenya. We used median costs of available generic medicines or brands of non-
          pharmaceuticals. We only used the price of originator medicines when they were the only ones
          available     in  the   Kenyan      market    (i.e.  there was   no  generic   alternative).     Costs for  personal
          protective equipment were from market prices.
          Laboratory and Radiology costs
          Supplementary file 1 outlines the laboratory and radiology test carried out on COVID-19 patients
          in Kenya. These were obtained from COVID-19 clinical guidelines for Kenya and billing information
          from 3 public COVID-19 treatment centers. We obtained information on inputs, their quantities
                                                                                                                   6|Page

          and costs for the PCR COVID-19 test from one of the national COVID-19 testing centers in Kenya.
          We used fees charged for laboratory tests and radiology by health facilities from the 2018 cost
          survey of 20 healthcare facilities in Kenya to represent their costs.
          Oxygen and Equipment costs
          We obtained oxygen and               equipment costs from local market prices. Medical equipment was
          assumed to have a useful life of 5 years.
          Transferring costs over time
          We used gross domestic product (GDP) deflators for Kenya to adjust 2018 input costs to 2020 and
          used an exchange rate of 1 United States Dollar (USD)=105.49 Kenya Shillings (KES), derived from
                                                     th
          oanda.com and accessed on 30                  June 2020, to convert Kenya shillings to USD. We report our
          findings in 2020 KES and USD.
          Results
          Unit costs for COVID-19 patients that are asymptomatic and mild to moderate disease
          Table   1   and    2  outlines     the  unit  costs   for  COVID-19  case   management         of patients   that  are
          asymptomatic and those that have mild to moderate symptoms respectively. Per day unit costs
          for  home-based         care     case  management       of  asymptomatic    patients     and  patients  will  mild  to
          moderate symptoms is KES 1,993.01 (USD 18.89) and 1995.17 (USD 18.991) respectively. When
          these patients are managed in a general hospital ward or an isolation center, per day unit costs
          for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild to moderate symptoms are estimated to be
          7,415.28 (USD 70.29) and 7,417.44 (USD 70.31) respectively. There is a negligible cost difference in
          the management of asymptomatic patients and patients with mild to moderate disease. This is
          because patients with mild to moderate disease only incur additional costs for symptom relievers
          such as paracetamol. PPE accounts for the largest share of costs for asymptomatic and mild to
          moderate disease. This is because these patients receive minimal interventions. They for instance
          hardly    receive     any    medicines,     do   not   undergo  any   radiological    tests,   and  do  not   receive
          supplemental oxygen.
          Unit costs under home-based care are substantially lower than unit costs for institutional care
          (hospitals or isolation centers). This is because home-based care avoids hospital accommodation
          and overhead costs and is characterized by minimal health worker-patient physical interactions
          and hence saves on staffing, accommodation, and personal protective equipment costs. The only
                                                                                                                   7|Page

          cost associated with health worker interactions are transport costs to assess the patient’s home
          for suitability of home - based care.
          Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 disease
          Table 3 outlines the unit cost for case management of COVID-19 patients with severe and critical
          disease. Per day unit costs for case management for severe disease are estimated to be KES
          12,570.75 (USD 119.16). Per day unit costs for case management for critical disease are estimated
          to be KES 59,369.42 (USD 562.79).              Severe disease patient costs differ from those of hospitalized
          patients with mild to moderate disease because of additional costs for pharmaceuticals (e.g.
          antibiotics), staff, and oxygen therapy. Patients with critical disease incur higher intensive care
          related costs that include specialist staff (e.g. critical care physicians, anaesthetists) and more
          staff   time     per    patient,     pharmaceuticals      (antibiotics  and   anaesthesia      medicine)   and   non-
          pharmaceuticals          (e.g.    total  parenteral    nutrition),  mechanical    ventilation,    other   monitoring
          equipment costs. Pharmaceuticals and PPE are the key contributors of costs for the management
          of patients with severe COVDI-19. This is because more health workers are involved in the care of
          these    patients      (increasing      PPE   costs)   and   the   patients  receive     pharmaceutical    and   non-
          pharmaceutical interventions such as antibiotics, fluids and oxygen. Staff costs contribute the
          largest share of costs for critical COVID-19 patients because these patients not only need more

          Discussion
          This study presents evidence on the costs of COVID-19 case management in Kenya. Specifically, its
          presents unit costs for the management of asymptomatic patients, and COVID-19 patients with
          mild to moderate, severe and critical disease. For asymptomatic and mild to moderate disease
          patients, we analyse costs for home-based care and those for care in isolation centers or general
          hospital wards. The findings show that COVID-19 case management costs are substantial for all
          treatment categories and increase as severity increases. These high case management costs have
          several implications. First, these costs will put a fiscal strain to LMIC health system’s like Kenya
          because of existing resource challenges. Kenya will need to actively mobilize both domestic and
          donor resources to meet these costs. Second, Kenya, and other LMIC may need to adapt case
          management guidelines further to improve efficiencies and affordability without compromising
          quality of care. A good example is the home-based care strategy that Kenya has already adopted
          for patients that are asymptomatic and those with mild to moderate disease. Our findings show
          that unit costs for home-based care are 4 times lower than those for institutional care resulting in
          substantial costs savings. However, not all asymptomatic and mild to moderate disease patients
          qualify for home-based care, and some will still need to be institutionalized because they are high
          risk (e.g. have co-morbidities) or their home environments are unsuitable for home-based care.
          These include individuals living in low income housing including urban informal settlements.
          These patients will still need to be institutionalized. However, the use of the same self-reporting
          mobile technology could for instance minimize health worker patient interactions and
          substantially reduce both staffing and PPE costs even for these hospitalized patients. Further, a
          lower cadre of health workers could also be used to monitor patients in isolation centers. Other
          adaptations could target cost drivers such as length of stay and discharge protocols, with
          patients discharged to home-based care as soon as their symptoms improve from severe to
          mild/moderate. A third implication is that Kenya and other LMICs will need mechanisms to
          protect COVID-19 patients from the financial burden of healthcare costs to access COVID-19
          services. If these costs are passed to patients as direct healthcare costs, they will result in
          substantial levels of catastrophic healthcare expenditures and impoverishment. There is
          therefore an urgent need for Kenya and LMICs in similar situations to develop a prepayment
          mechanism to provide financial risk protection to patients and households against the financial
          hardship that they will face if required to pay for COVID-19 case management costs out of pocket.
          This analysis has several limitations. First, we extensively relied on normative guidelines
          assumptions and cost data from previous studies, and only collected data from 3 COVID-19
                                                                                                                  11 | P a g e

          treatment centers because it was impossible to carry out real world extensive data collection
          given existing physical distancing restrictions. However, this limitation is mitigated by the fact
          that there is no specific COVID-19 treatment and that COVID-19 case management reflects
          management of non-COVID-19 patients with the same symptoms. The cost survey we relied on
          was also relatively recent. Second, this analysis presents data for public sector costs. Private
          sector costs would be useful given that the COVID-19 response will require governments to
          purchase services from both the public and private sector in settings like Kenya where the private
          sector plays a significant role in healthcare service provision. Third, input costs for some items,
          especially PPE’s are volatile because of market disruptions and are likely to stabilize much later,
          and thus reducing the unit costs of case management. We have however used market prices 8
          months into the pandemic which are likely to be closer to the stable prices in the future rather
          than the costs at the beginning of the pandemic. Third, we did not analyse costs for the range of
          possible COVID-19 complications. This is because unit costs exist for some of these, for instance
          for kidney replacement therapy, and costing the entire range of possible complications would
          require data what were not available given the fieldwork restrictions as a result of physical
          distancing measures. These limitations not-withstanding, the estimates we present will be useful
          in informing Kenya’s resource mobilization for the COVID-19, budgeting and planning, as well as
          informing the country’s plan to develop appropriate purchasing mechanisms that include
          provider payment mechanism and rates that are appropriate for COVID-19. The estimates will also
          find utility in parametizing cost-effectiveness models for COVID-19 interventions as and when
          they become available such as a COVID-19 vaccine. While these costs estimates have been
          developed for Kenya, they could potentially find use and applicability in other LMIC’s with
          comparable settings after adapting and adjusting with country specific assumptions.
