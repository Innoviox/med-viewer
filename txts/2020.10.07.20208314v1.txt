    Abstract
    While general lockdowns have proven effective to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, they come
    with enormous costs for society. It is therefore essential to identify control strategies with lower
    social and economic impact. Here, we report and evaluate the control strategy implemented
    during a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in June-July 2020 in French Guiana that relied on curfews,
    targeted lockdowns and other measures. We find that the combination of these interventions
    reduced the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 from 1.7 to 1.1, which was sufficient to
    avoid saturation of hospitals. We estimate that thanks to the young demographics across the
    territory, the risk of hospitalisation following infection was 0.3 times that of metropolitan France
    and that about 20% of the population was infected by July. Our model projections are consistent
    with a recent seroprevalence study. The study showcases how mathematical modeling can be
    used to support healthcare planning and decision making in a context of high uncertainty.
                                                                                                                                       2

    Introduction
    Following its emergence in China in December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has quickly spread
    around the world [1]. To avoid saturation of their healthcare systems, many countries enforced
    nationwide lockdowns. While such an approach has demonstrated its efficacy for transmission
    control [2–5], it comes with very high social and economic costs [6,7]. As a consequence,
    lockdowns cannot be sustained for long periods of time and it remains essential to identify sets of
    interventions with lower impact on society that are effective enough to contain epidemic rebounds
    of SARS-CoV-2.
    While mathematical modelling can help evaluate the likely impact of different strategies,
    demonstration of efficacy comes when these approaches are successfully implemented in the
    field. However, testing new control strategies during an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is a
    difficult and stressful exercise for policy makers. If the new strategy does not reduce transmission
    rates sufficiently, this could have dramatic consequences for the healthcare system. Furthermore,
    underlying delays between infection and hospital admission mean that the effect of the
    interventions on the healthcare system can only be confidently measured a few weeks after their
    implementation. During this time period, policy makers do not know whether the strategy will be
    successful, case counts may continue to rise along with the pressure on the healthcare system
    and the time window to implement corrective measures is shrinking. Confronted with such an
    uncertain and quickly evolving situation, it is essential to plan for the worst. In this context,
    mathematical modelling can help construct realistic scenarios to inform plans for a surge in ICU
    capacity or a strengthening of control measures [4,8–10] and quickly revise these scenarios as
    more data become available.
    Ultimately, the insight we gain from these local experiences will be key to progressively optimize
    control strategies and determine the minimal set of interventions that is sufficient for the control
    of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic rebounds. Here, we report on the local experience of French Guiana,
    a French overseas territory located in Latin America in the Amazonian forest complex, where
    authorities managed to contain a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic with the use of curfews, local
    lockdowns and other measures. We describe the epidemic dynamics, the interventions that were
    implemented and their impact and show how mathematical modelling was used throughout the
    outbreak to support healthcare planning and policy making in a context of high uncertainty.

    Results
    Epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 in a young population: impact on healthcare demand
    The severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection increases with the age of the individual [2,11,12]. As a
    consequence, the impact of a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic on the healthcare system is expected to
    vary with the demographic structure of the population it is spreading in [13]. The population of
    French Guiana is substantially younger than that in metropolitan France, with a median age of
    27y in French Guiana compared to 42y in metropolitan France (Figure 1B). We used our
    mathematical model [2] to anticipate how these differences were expected to affect stress on the
    healthcare system for a given level of circulation of the virus.
    During the first pandemic wave in metropolitan France, we estimated age-specific probabilities of
    hospitalisation given infection under the assumption that children were half as infectious as adults
    (Figure 1C) [2]. We found that, on average, in metropolitan France, a person infected by SARS-
    CoV-2 had 3.5% [1.9%, 5.8%] probability of being hospitalized (Figure 1D) [2]. Applying these
    age-specific probabilities to the demographic structure and expected contact patterns in French
    Guiana, we anticipated that the average probability of hospitalization upon infection would be
    1.1% [0.6%, 1.8%] in this population (Figure 1D). This means that, for the same number of
    infections, we expected 0.32 times as many hospitalisations in French Guiana as in metropolitan
    France.
    Measures implemented to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in French Guiana
    Like the rest of France, a territory-wide lockdown was imposed in French Guiana from March 17th
    2020 to May 11th 2020. At that point, the lockdown was eased but not entirely lifted: schools,
    places of worship and movie theaters stayed closed, while restaurants and bars were allowed to
    reopen but were limited to outdoor sitting for on-site dining. A curfew was established from 11PM
    to 5AM every day except in Saint Georges, a city located on the border with Brazil, where a
    complete lockdown was maintained. Terrestrial borders were closed and travel restrictions were
    implemented to reduce the risk of spatial spread. Despite these measures, and concomitantly
    with the acceleration of the epidemic in Brazil (that neighbors French Guiana), the number of
    cases started to rise at the end of May 2020. In response to this rise, control measures were
    strengthened on June 10th, with the general curfew being extended from 9PM to 5AM during
    weekdays and for the entire day on Sundays. On June 18th, the curfew was extended again from
    7PM to 5AM during weekdays and from 3PM on Saturday during the weekend. Additional
                                                                                                                                       4

    measures from June 25th, included the start of the curfew from 5PM during weekdays and from
    1PM on Saturday during the weekend, enforced closure of all restaurants, the closure of the
    Brazilian border and the lockdown of 23 high-risk areas. There were also important screening
    campaigns with more than 1300 tests per 100 000 inhabitants per week in the weeks following
    June 15th 2020. A partial easing of the more stringent measures - in particular the local lockdowns
    - took place on July 25th (Figure 1E). The implementation and schedule of the curfews were
    adapted to each area according to the epidemiological situation.
    Planning for the worst
    A key challenge for the management of such an epidemic is that it is not possible to evaluate the
    impact of new control measures on hospital admissions for the 2-3 weeks that follow their
    implementation (about 11 days from infection to hospitalisation [14] and between 5 and 10 days
    to accumulate sufficient data to characterize trends post intervention). During this stressful period,
    cases continue to rise and we do not know if control measures will provide the expected reduction
    in infections. At a time of such high uncertainty, it is important to plan adequate healthcare
    capacity and a potential strengthening of control measures in case transmission rates following
    intervention are not sufficiently reduced. We ran two analyses during this period to support such
    planning.
    What if control measures do not reduce transmission? To support healthcare planning and
    ensure appropriate scaling of the local ICU capacity, we evaluated healthcare demand in a worst-
    case scenario assuming that local transmission rates would remain unchanged despite the
    additional control measures. This was done considering a broad spectrum of scenarios for the
    probability of hospitalisation of an infected individual (baseline: 𝑝𝐻 = 1.1%; low: 𝑝𝐻 = 0.6%; high:
    𝑝𝐻 = 1.8%) (Figure 1D) and the duration of stay in ICU (baseline: 𝜏𝐼𝐶𝑈 = 11.4 days; short: 𝜏𝐼𝐶𝑈 =
    8.0 days; long: 𝜏𝐼𝐶𝑈 = 15.0 days) based on early estimates from local data.
    Calibrated to data available on June 18th, our model identified that there had been an acceleration
    of the epidemic around May 20th, with the basic reproduction number increasing from 1.35 [1.26,
    1.45] (before May 20th) to 1.78 [1.68, 1.88] (afterwards). In the scenario where the transmission
    rate remained unchanged following interventions, the peak of the epidemic was expected in July
    (Figure 2A and 2B). Depending on the severity scenario, the peak number of daily hospitalisations
    was projected at 48 [34, 65] for average severity (low severity: 28 [18, 40]; high severity: 75 [55,
    96]) while the peak number of daily ICU admissions was projected at 11 [4, 18] (low severity: 6
    [2, 11]; high severity: 16 [8, 25]). The number of general ward beds required at the peak was
                                                                                                                                       5

    estimated at 454 [383, 528] for average severity (low severity: 262 [221, 305]; high severity 715
    [592, 831]), and the number of ICU beds at 110 [86, 137] (low severity: 63 [47, 82], high severity:
    173 [135, 210]). Figure S1 shows that the projected timing and intensity of the peak were overall
    more sensitive to the probability of hospitalisation 𝑝𝐻 than to the duration of stay in ICU 𝜏𝐼𝐶𝑈 .
    Impact of a short lockdown on peak intensity: Given the quickly expanding epidemic, the
    limited ICU capacity and the possibility that existing control measures might not sufficiently reduce
    transmission, the option of imposing a short lockdown in French Guiana was also considered by
    French authorities. We assessed how such a lockdown might ease peak healthcare demand,
    assuming that it would lead to similar transmission rates as those observed in metropolitan France
    with a lockdown reproduction number of 0.7. This was done considering different start dates and
    durations for the lockdown (Figure 2C and 2D). We found that a territory-wide 10 days lockdown
    would reduce the required number of general ward beds from 454 [383, 528] to 256 [222, 290] (if
    started on June 27th) or to 345 [276, 427] (if started on July 4th). Similarly, the expected number
    of required ICU beds was projected to decrease from 110 [86, 137] to 63 [45, 86] (lockdown
    starting on June 27th) or to 84 [61, 111] (lockdown starting on July 4th).
    Eventually given the societal and economic cost associated with a territory-wide lockdown, this
    strategy was ruled out and it was decided to implement less drastic measures accompanied by
    an increase of ICU bed capacity and the planning of patient transfers to hospitals in Martinique
    and Guadeloupe.
    Initial estimates of the impact of interventions on the epidemic trajectory
    Once sufficient time had passed, we ascertained the impact of the new interventions by adding a
    change point, to be estimated, for the transmission rate (model M2). From June 27th onwards,
    this model had better DIC support than model M1 with no change in transmission (Figure S2).
    Model M2 estimated that the transmission rate was reduced from June 15th [10th, 19th],
    coincidentally with the strengthening of control measures (Figure S3). According to the model,
    the basic reproduction number went from 1.40 [1.32, 1.49] before May 20th to 1.71 [1.65, 1.77]
    between May 20th and June 15th and 1.14 [0.95, 1.31] after June 15th (Figure 3A). This suggests
    that the strict curfew measures were successful at reducing transmission. With these reduced
    transmission rates, projections of the number of hospital and ICU beds required at the peak
    dropped to 28 [17, 42] ICU beds and 162 [127, 203] general ward beds (Figure 3C and 3D).

    Figure 4 shows the projections obtained from model M2 calibrated using data available on August
    25th 2020. The probability 𝑝𝐼𝐶𝑈 of ICU admission given hospitalisation was estimated at 15.7%
    [13.9%, 17.6%] and the time spent in ICU 𝜏𝐼𝐶𝑈 at 15.0 [13.1, 17.4] days. Our projections have
    been relatively stable since the beginning of July (Figure 4A-D).
    We retrospectively validated our model by comparing model predictions with the results of a
    seroprevalence survey performed between July 15th and July 23rd with the Euroimmun assay
    [15]. Assuming a time-dependent assay sensitivity (0% during incubation, 30.3% up to 10 days
    after symptom onset, 75% between 10 and 20 days after symptom onset, and 93.8% afterwards)
    as per the distributor specification, our model estimated that 17.6% [17.2%, 18.0%] of the
    population was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 between July 15th and July 23rd for average
    severity (low severity: 31.8% [31.1%, 32.6%]; high severity: 10.7% [10.5%, 11.0%]) (Figure 4E).
    Estimates for average severity are close to the seroprevalence of 15.4% [9.3%, 24.4%] obtained
    in the serosurvey, indicating that our average severity scenario remains the one that is best
    supported by the data. Projecting forward, we anticipate that 30.6% [29.9%, 31.3%] (low severity:
    51.9% [50.9%, 52.9%]; high severity: 19.3% [18.8%, 19.7%]) of the population in French Guiana
    will have been infected by October 1st 2020 (Figure 4F).
    Discussion
    In this paper, we characterized the epidemic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in French Guiana,
    evaluated the impact of control measures that were implemented to contain a large SARS-CoV-
    2 epidemic there, and described how mathematical modelling was used during this crisis to
    support policy making and planning.
    The nation-wide lockdown that was implemented across France from March 17th 2020 to May
    11th 2020 likely prevented a surge of SARS-CoV-2 infections in French Guiana during this period.
    However, while a number of control measures remained in place in French Guiana after the
    lockdown, they were insufficient to stop an important epidemic rebound. This epidemic was likely
    facilitated by the proximity of Brazil, a country that has experienced a very important pandemic
    wave [16,17], notably in neighboring Amazonian states. Confronted with an important surge in
    COVID-19 cases, French authorities implemented a set of strong measures including curfews
    and localized lockdowns. During curfews, individuals can go to work and live a relatively normal
    life during the day, but social interactions are limited in the evenings and weekends. This approach
    therefore targets social interactions in the private sphere where social distancing is more likely to
                                                                                                                                       7

    be relaxed. While smaller than that of a full lockdown, the economic impact of a curfew remains
    important in particular for the hospitality, catering and recreational sectors, as well as for a large
    part of the undeclared jobs on which the most precarious rely on in French Guiana.
    We estimate that, added to existing measures, these interventions further reduced the basic
    reproduction number by 36% from 1.7 (prior to interventions) to 1.1 (following implementation).
    This change in epidemic dynamics strongly reduced predicted ICU beds needs for the epidemic
    peak from 110 to 32, thereby avoiding saturation of ICUs. The territory was also able to manage
    the influx of patients thanks to an expansion of ICU capacity (from 11 on May 1 2020 to 54 on
    July 22 2020) and the transfer of 7 ICU patients to Martinique and 6 to Guadeloupe, two French
    overseas territories located in the Caribbean.
    In agreement with a seroprevalence study [15], we find that the infection attack rate of SARS-
    CoV-2 in French Guiana is currently one of the highest in France, likely higher than that estimated
    for Grand Est (7.7%-10.2% between May 4th and June 22nd) and Île-de-France (Paris area)
    (9.1%-10.9% between May 4th and June 22nd), the two regions of metropolitan France that have
    been the most affected by the first pandemic wave [18]. This may seem surprising since the
    impact of the epidemic on hospitalisations and deaths was substantially lower in French Guiana
    (183 hospitalisations by July 1st and 13 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants by July 18th) than in
    Grand Est (276 hospitalisations by May 25th and 60 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants by June 11th)
    and Île-de-France (280 hospitalisations by May 25th and 56 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants by
    June 11th). This apparent discrepancy was anticipated by our model and can be explained
    because the population of French Guiana is substantially younger than that of metropolitan
    France (Figure 1). This shows that it is essential to account for the age structure of a population
    to properly evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on its healthcare system. In an older population,
    it is likely that pressure on the healthcare system would have occurred earlier in the epidemic,
    leading to earlier implementation of control measures and lower seroprevalence. Improvements
    in patient management thanks for example to anticoagulation, steroid and ventilation may have
    also contributed to averting deaths [19,20].
    Major methodological developments have been made in the last few years to strengthen epidemic
    forecasting, with seasonal influenza or dengue constituting good case studies [21,22]. In a typical
    seasonal influenza epidemic, measures to reduce transmission in the general population are
    limited. As a consequence, once the epidemic has started, we expect that it will follow its natural
    course and that its trajectory can be forecasted if we have a good understanding of its key drivers

    (e.g. impact of the climate, population immunity, school holidays and circulating influenza
    subtype). In contrast, for SARS-CoV-2, unprecedented control measures are being implemented
    to limit spread; in addition, individuals are likely to naturally modify their behaviours (e.g. to reduce
    their contacts) as the pandemic progresses in their community [23]. A simple international
    comparison shows how the control measures and behaviours that are adopted can radically
    change the course of the pandemic from scenarios of near-suppression in South Korea and New
    Zealand to much less favorable ones in Brazil and the US. In addition, both control measures and
    individual behaviours may quickly change with the epidemiological situation, in a way that may be
    hard to anticipate. All these elements explain why it is much more challenging to forecast the
    trajectory of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic wave than that of, for example, a seasonal influenza
    epidemic. Given these difficulties, we prefer to talk about scenario analysis rather than forecasts.
    French Guiana constitutes an interesting case study where a combination of strict interventions
    including curfews and localized lockdown substantially reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We
    need to build on these local experiences to progressively determine the optimal set of
    interventions required to contain SARS-CoV-2 pandemic waves.

    Methods
    We used a deterministic mathematical model to describe the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and
    subsequent disease progression in the population of French Guiana. The compartmental
    structure of the model closely followed our previous work [2]: upon infection, susceptible
    individuals enter a first latent compartment where they are not infectious, while a second exposed
    compartment is used to capture individuals who are infectious but not yet symptomatic. Once
    infected, individuals can develop severe disease and require hospital and/or ICU care. We used
    two versions of the model. A first version explicitly accounted for the age structure in the
    population. To describe contact patterns in the population of French Guiana, we used a contact
    matrix from Suriname [24], a neighboring territory with similar population structure. We adjusted
    the contact matrix for age-groups 0-9y, 10-19y, 20-29y, 30-39y, 40-49y, 50-59y, 60-69y, 70y+
    accounting for the population structure of French Guiana. In order to accelerate computation and
    shorten the turnaround time of our analyses, we developed a second version of the model in
    which we no longer explicitly included the population age structure in the model. We instead relied
    on a single severity parameter, the average probability of hospitalization given infection 𝑝𝐻 .
    Assuming that the probability of infection is proportional to the daily number of contacts within
    each age group (𝐶𝑖 for age-group i) [2], this severity parameter can be estimated from the age-
    specific probability of hospitalization upon infection (𝑝𝐻 𝑖 for age-group i) and the age distribution
    of the target population as follows:
                ∑𝐴𝑔𝑒 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝 𝑖                 𝑃𝐻 𝑖 ⋅ 𝐶𝑖 ⋅ 𝑛𝑖
    𝑝𝐻 =                                                            where 𝑛𝑖 is the number of individuals aged i in the
                       ∑𝐴𝑔𝑒 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝 𝑖              𝐶𝑖 ⋅ 𝑛𝑖
    target population. Throughout this analysis, we considered young people to be half as infectious
    as adults. Results obtained with the full age-structured model under our final assumptions closely
    matched those obtained with the simpler version (Figure S4).
    In order to capture trends in the epidemic trajectory following the strengthening of control
    measures in French Guiana, we modified the structure of our model for the analyses we
    performed at the beginning of July 2020: while our initial model (M1) had a single change point
    for the transmission rate, our final model (M2) had two change points for this parameter. Table
    S1 summarizes the models’ key parameters.

    The simulations were seeded on April 21st 2020 with an initial number of infectious individuals -
    split into the exposed and infectious compartments proportionally to the time spent in each
    compartment - that was estimated jointly with the parameters in Table S1.
    We fitted our models to daily hospitalization count data extracted from the SI-VIC database, which
    stores data on COVID-19 patients hospitalized in public and private hospitals in metropolitan
    France and overseas French territories. The data were corrected for reporting delays as
    previously described [2].
    The model parameters were estimated via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
    assuming a Poisson observation process and using uniform, non-informative, priors. We relied
    on the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) for model comparison and selection [25], with smaller
    DIC values indicating stronger support for the model.
