          Abstract
          Background
          SARS-Cov-2 is a new virus causing a pandemic of primarily respiratory illness designated as
          Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This disease is associated with excess mortality, particularly
          among the elderly, raising concerns for public health. It is crucial to identify whether existing
          medications could protect against adverse outcomes of COVID-19 infection.
          Methods
          We performed a population-based study among members of Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest
          healthcare provider in Israel. CHS centrally manages electronic health records (EHR) including
          medication purchases for over 4.5 million members. Since the disease outbreak through October 10,
          2020, 8,681 adult patients aged between 18 and 95 have been hospitalized for COVID-19, among
          them 3,777 in severe condition. Two case-control matched cohorts were assembled to assess which
          drugs taken by patients in the month preceding a SARS-CoV-2 positive test, affected risks of
          COVID-19 hospitalization. Significance of the associations was assessed using Fisher's exact test and
          Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing.
          Results
          Several drugs and pharmacy sold products were significantly associated with reduced odds ratios of
          SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization: ubiquinone (OR=0.25, p<0.001), ezetimibe (OR=0.51, P<0.001),
          rosuvastatin (OR=0.75, p<0.001) and flecainide (OR=0.30, p<0.01). Additionally, acquisition of
          surgical masks, latex gloves and several ophthalmological products were associated with decreased
          risk for hospitalization.
          Conclusion
          Ubiquinone, ezetimibe and rosuvastatin, all related to the cholesterol synthesis pathway, are
          associated with reduced hospitalization rate and decreased severity in hospitalized patients. These
          findings set the basis for specific prospective randomized control trials that should be carried out to
          carefully assess their protective effects.

          Background
          SARS-Cov-2 is a new single-stranded RNA virus, which was first identified in December 2019, and
          has rapidly spread into a global pandemic of primarily respiratory illness designated as Coronavirus
          Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This disease is associated with significant mortality, particularly among
          elderly or overweight individuals, raising considerable concerns for public health. Until a vaccine or
          specifically designed therapies are available, it is urgent to identify whether existing medications have
          protective effects against COVID-19 complications from available real-world data. This is the aim of
          this case-control study which was performed on electronic health records (EHR) from Clalit Health
          Services (CHS), the largest healthcare provider in Israel.
          Methods
          We collected from the Clalit Health Services (CHS) data warehouse selected variables from the EHR
          of adult patients aged 18 to 95 years, who had been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between the
          beginning of the pandemics and until September 25, and were admitted for hospitalization until
          October 10, 2020. Each patient was assigned an index date, which is the first date at which a positive
          PCR test SARS-CoV-2 test was collected for the patient. Patients' demographic characteristics were
          queried, along with existing comorbidities, clinical characteristics including BMI, and glomerular
          filtration rate (GFR) as of February 2020. For each patient, the list of drugs or products acquired in
          CHS pharmacies was collected for the preceding month, defined as 35 to 2 days before the index date.
          We assigned the hospitalized COVID-19 patients to two distinct case-control cohorts, which differ in
          the pool from which control individuals were selected. In cohort 1, control patients were chosen
          among the general population of CHS members. Since we can select controls from among millions of
          individuals, we took 5 controls for each case (5:1), and comprehensively controlled by matching
          baseline attributes, including age, gender, BMI category, socio-economic and smoking status, chronic
          kidney disease (CKD) stage for patients with renal impairment, and main comorbidities diagnoses
          (hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic
          obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, ischemic heart disease). We assigned to each
          control the same index date as the matched case, verified that the patient was still alive and a member
          of CHS at this date, and collected EHR data for controls in a similar manner to that described for
          cases. This cohort is designed to identify drugs that affect the overall risk for hospitalization for
          COVID-19, where the effect could combine a decreased risk of detectable infection, and a decreased
          risk for hospitalization once infected.
                                                                       4

          In cohort 2, control patients were chosen among patients who had a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 but
          had not been hospitalized as of October 10, 2020. Given the smaller size of the pool from which
          controls can be drawn, we matched only two controls for each case patient. Attributes which were
          matched were the age, gender, smoking status, Adjusted Clinical Groups® (ACG) measure of
          comorbidity1 and presence of obesity diagnosis. The index date taken was the date of first positive
          SARS-CoV-2 test both for cases and controls. This cohort is more specifically suited to identify drugs
          that are associated with a decreased risk for COVID-19 hospitalization in patients who had proven
          infection with the virus. In both cohorts, there were a minority of individuals for which a full match
          could not be found; these cases were dropped from their respective cohorts and excluded from the
          analyses.
          Reliable identification of medications procured for the last 35 days is enabled by the fact that in CHS,
          distinct prescriptions are issued for each calendar month. When medications are provided in advance
          for multiple months, the date at which the prescription for each month of treatment begins is recorded.
          In each cohort, and for each medication anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) class, we computed
          the odds ratio for hospitalization according to the number of patients who acquired a medication of
          the class between 35 days and 2 days preceding the index date, in the case and the control groups.
          Medications found to be significantly associated with hospitalization were also tested for association
          with disease severity, using a nested analysis in sub-cohorts of patients from the main cohort grouped
          by disease severity, according to the scale defined by the World Health Organization (WHO): mild
          (3), serious (4), severe (5-7), deceased (8).
          Based on the results from the two cohorts, which highlighted a significant protective effect for
          ubiquinone, ezetimibe, and a statin, which are often prescribed in combination, we subsequently
          investigated the association between various combinations of these drugs and the outcomes using the
          same approach.
          This study has been approved by the CHS Institutional Review Board (IRB) with a waiver of
          informed consent, approval number: COM-0046-20. Patients’ data were extracted and processed from
          CHS data-warehouse using programs developed inhouse in Python and SQL. Identifying patient data
          were removed prior to the statistical analyses in accordance to the protocol approved by the CHS IRB.
          Statistical analysis
          Odds ratios for acquisition for drugs in the case versus control groups and statistical significance were
          assessed by Fisher's exact test. P-values below 0.05 were considered significant. Correction for
          multiple testing was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure2, which gives an estimation
                                                                       5

          of the false discovery rate (FDR) in the list. Statistical analyses were performed in R statistical
          software version 3.6 (R Foundation for statistical computing).
          Results
          Through October 10, 2020, 8,681 adult patients between aged 18 and 95 had a recorded COVID-19
          related hospitalization in the CHS database. The matching procedure was able to identify control
          individuals from the general population in ratio 5:1 for 6,202 patients in the first cohort, and control
          patients in ratio 2:1 from 6,919 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals in the second cohort. The
          characteristics of the matched populations are shown in Table 1.
          In each of the two cohorts, we counted the number of patients from each group who acquired drugs
          and other medical products from each Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) and computed the
          odds ratios and p-values using Fisher's test. The distribution of odds ratio for drugs for which the p-
          value was significant (p<0.05) is shown in Figure 1. The odds ratios for most drugs are neutral or
          associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Only a small fraction of the products
          are associated with decreased risk: 1.15% for cohort 1, and 1.75% in cohort 2.
          Table 2 presents the list of drugs/products that were found to be negatively associated with COVID-
          19 hospitalization in a statistically significant manner in cohort 1 (A) and in cohort 2 (B). We display
          items for which the p-value is below 0.05, and for which the false discovery rate (FDR) is less than
          0.30, meaning that at least 70% of the items in the displayed list are expected to have a true protective
          effect. Items are sorted by decreasing order of significance, so that the associations that are the least
          likely to have happened by chance are displayed first.
          The most significant medications in both cohorts are ubiquinone, ezetimibe, and rosuvastatin. It is
          remarkable that these three drugs act on the cholesterol and ubiquinone synthesis pathways, which
          both stem from the mevalonate pathway3; the intermediate product at the branch point is farnesyl
          polyphosphate (FPP). Ubiquinone is a food supplement available over the counter (OTC) in Israel,
          which is often recommended to patients prone to muscular pain and receiving a statin treatment4.
          Since Ezetimibe, statins and ubiquinone are often used in combination, we performed a nested
          analysis to more specifically evaluate the impact of possible combinations on the risk of
          hospitalization. Table 3 presents the odds ratio and p-values associated with acquisition of statins,
          ubiquinone, and ezetimibe alone and in combination in the whole cohort, and in sub-cohorts of
          hospitalized patients defined by disease severity. Ubiquinone’s protective effect appears to be more
          pronounced when given in combination with a statin (OR=0.122, P=0.008, first cohort, for
          hospitalization in moderate condition). Remarkably, the protective effect of ezetimibe is the strongest
                                                                       6

          when this molecule is taken without a statin (OR=0.275, P=0.037, second cohort for severe
          hospitalization), while the effect observed when ezetimibe is taken with a statin is similar to the effect
          of the statin alone. Also identified by both cohorts is flecainide, an antiarrhythmic medication, for
          which the difference in usage rate among hospitalized patients is significant both in cohorts 1 and
          cohort 2. Several additional protective drugs observed in cohort 2 include risedronic acid (OR=0.593,
          p=0.002), a drug usually prescribed for osteoporosis; several drugs acting at synapses of different
          types (bupropion, donepezil, mirabegron); vitamins (vitamin B12 combination, retinol for the eye),
          and minerals (calcium-zinc, magnesium).
          A significant protective effect is interestingly observed for several non-drug items that could act as a
          barrier in both cohorts: surgical masks, latex gloves, eye care wipes (sterile wipes for eye hygiene),
          artificial tears, eye drops and ointments.
          Discussion
          We identified several drugs and products that are significantly associated with reduced odds for
          COVID-19 hospitalization, both in the general population, and in patients with laboratory proven
          SARS-CoV-2 infection. Major strengths of our study include: (i) the large sample of hospitalized
          COVID-19 patients, (ii) the ability to collect comprehensive data about individual demographic and
          comorbidity characteristics and to build matched case and control populations, (iii) the ability to track
          hospitalizations and disease severity, owing to a central database established by the Israeli Ministry of
          Health and, (iv) the capacity to track which drugs and products have been acquired by patients in the
          period that have preceded SARS-CoV-2 infection, owing to comprehensive digital systems
          integration in CHS.
          The dual cohort design, with control individuals taken from the general population in the first cohort
          and from individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the second cohort, with each using different
          matching criteria, mitigates potential bias that could affect each cohort. The two cohorts allow to
          evaluate the protective effect of drugs that act either by reducing the initial risk of infection, or by
          reducing the risk of hospitalization in those infected. Analyses are based on items procured between
          35 and 2 days before the initial positive test. This window was chosen in accordance to the monthly
          renewal of prescription policy in place in CHS, with a blackout of 2 days which was intended to
          exclude acquisitions related to initial symptoms of the disease.
          Limitations are related to this study being observational in nature. Best efforts were made to use
          matching so that patients in case and controls are similar regarding most of the known factors for
          disease severity, and notably, age, obesity, smoking, and baseline comorbidity. We aimed to get a
          good tradeoff between controlling for confounding factors by rigorous matching and keeping enough
                                                                       7

          patients so that cohorts are representative of the general population. Our analysis is based on
          medication acquisition in pharmacies and does not ascertain that medications purchased were used.
          Notably, some of the drugs associated with a protective effect may have been stopped during patient's
          hospitalization so that our analysis may have underestimated the full achievable benefit for some of
          the drugs. Conversely, since drugs tested here were acquired before patients were positive for SARS-
          CoV-2, the protective effect of some of the drugs may be fully attained only when treatment is started
          before or early in the infection.
          Bearing these potential limitations in mind, our analyses point to several different viral vulnerability
          points, which can potentially be exploited to effectively fight the virus with drugs that are already
          available. The drugs identified as protective are ubiquinone, which is a food supplement with a very
          good safety profile that does not even require a prescription in Israel; rosuvastatin and ezetimibe, two
          drugs prescribed routinely to reduce cholesterol, and who are considered safe. These findings are in
          line with previous reports that RNA viruses need cholesterol to enter cells, for virion assembly, and to
          maintain structural stability5–8, and that prescribing statins may protect against infection with RNA
          viruses such as members of family Flaviviridae, including Dengue virus, Zika virus, and West Nile
          virus9–11. The involvement of the cholesterol/ubiquinone pathway is further confirmed by the fact that
          risedronic acid, a drug acting on the enzyme farnesyl pyroposhpate synthase12 which catalyzes the
          production of FPP from which the cholesterol and the Ubiquinone synthesis pathways split3, is
          identified as protective as well, even though it is prescribed for osteoporosis regardless of the
          presence of hypercholesterolemia.
          Taken together, our findings lend (albeit indirect) support to the possibility that SARS-CoV2 hijacks
          the cholesterol synthesis pathway, possibly to boost production of the cellular cholesterol it needs as
          an RNA virus. The fact that ubiquinone protects against severe disease, suggests that SARS-CoV2
          may tilt the mevalonate pathway towards cholesterol synthesis and away from ubiquinone synthesis.
          Such a pathway imbalance would ultimately result in deficiency of ubiquinone that could lead to cell
          death unless counteracted by ubiquinone supplementation.
          Another medication that appears protective is flecainide, an antiarrhythmic drug that blocks sodium
          channels in the heart, and inhibits ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), a major regulator of sarcoplasmic
          release of stored calcium ions. It may prevent apoptosis by release of calcium from the ER, once the
          cell mitochondria cease to function. An expert review recommended that patients with arrhythmia
          who get COVID-19 should continue flecainide treatment if already prescribed13. In our study, the
          protective effect observed in both cohorts is even more marked for severe patients. If this effect is
          confirmed in clinical trials, this drug, which can be given intravenously14, could be administered in
          patients in respiratory distress, even if unconscious.
                                                                       8

          Reassuringly, we find items that act as a barrier among the most protective items, including surgical
          masks, latex gloves, eye wipes, eye drops, and ointments. The protective effect against hospitalization
          is observed foremost among patients from cohort 2 in which controls are already SARS-CoV-2
          positive. This suggests that barrier products could protect not only against the initial risk of infection,
          but also by reducing the severity in patients already infected. In our cohorts, we observe a beneficial
          effect for many ophthalmologic preparations, which raises the possibility that autoinoculation of the
          virus to the eyes could play a part in disease virulence, a prospect supported by the fact eyeglass
          wearers were at decreased risk for COVID-19 hospitalization15. Until the meaning of these findings is
          fully understood, it may be wise to advise COVID-19 patients to avoid touching their eyes to reduce
          the risk of complications.
          In conclusion, considering the observed protective effects of ubiquinone, ezetimibe, rosuvastatine,
          risedronate and flecainide in this large population analysis, we recommend to further investigate these
          and other products identified by this study, in prospective trials aimed to reduce disease severity in
          COVID-19 patients.
