         Abstract
         Background: Patients with active acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) are at risk for
         leukemic infiltration (LI) into the lung and acute tumor lysis pneumopathy (ATLP) following
         chemotherapy. Fulminant presentations of these leukemic lung diseases are well-described,
         but indolent forms have not yet been studied. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the clinical
         features of mild-to-moderate LI and ATLP.
         Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed on 51 hospitalized patients with
         AML, circulating blast count ≥3%, non-critical illness, and receipt of bronchoscopy between
         2015-2019. Diagnoses of LI and ATLP were made via retrospective chart review by a
         multidisciplinary team of physicians.
         Results: 19 cases of leukemic lung disease were identified: 14 with LI and 5 with ATLP. The
         clinical presentations closely resembled pneumonia, with the majority demonstrating
         respiratory symptoms (63%), hypoxemia (63%), fever (84%), and pulmonary opacities
         (100%). All patients were presumptively diagnosed with infection, leading to an average of 18
                                                                                                                                        1

         days of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and multiple instances of delayed chemotherapy in
         treatment candidates. Although most patients were near the end-of-life (90% died within 1
         year), transitions to comfort care were infrequent (25%) and hospitalizations were protracted
         (median 25 days).
         Conclusions: LI and ATLP are common yet under-recognized pulmonary complications in
         patients with active AML. When presenting indolently, these conditions are difficult to
         distinguish from lung infection, leading to missed diagnosis, inappropriate antibiosis,
         chemotherapy deferrals, and prolonged hospitalizations. Greater awareness and consensus
         definitions of LI and ATLP are therefore needed to improve care of this population.

         Introduction
         Pulmonary complications are common in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
         frequently life-threatening.1,2 Indeed, they occur in up to 80% of patients with AML and carry
         a 70% risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, with nearly 50% mortality.1,3–8 Due to the
         myelophthisic biology of AML and myeloablative chemotherapy used for induction, patients
         are often immunosuppressed and therefore susceptible to infection. Consequently,
         management of respiratory illness in this population focuses heavily on the identification and
         treatment of pneumonia.
         Certain studies support the view that infection is the leading respiratory complication in
         patients with AML, but most are remote.9–11 More recent work indicates a growing proportion
         of non-infectious etiologies,5 including drug toxicities, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH),
         cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and leukemic lung disease.12 The reasons for this shifting
         epidemiology are unclear, but may relate to increased utilization of prophylactic antibiotics in
         leukemic patients and decreased incidence of bacterial pneumonia in the general population
         due to pneumococcal vaccination.13–16
         Leukemic lung disease represents an important noninfectious cause of respiratory illness in
         patients with active AML. However, it is considered the rarest etiology in this population and
         therefore may be overlooked.17 Three manifestations of leukemic lung disease have been
         defined in the literature: (i) leukostasis, an emergent medical condition characterized by
         intravascular accumulation of blasts, increased blood viscosity, vascular inflammation, and
         multi-organ dysfunction;18–20 (ii) leukemic infiltration (LI) of blasts into the lung parenchyma;
         and (iii) acute tumor lysis pneumopathy (ATLP), an inflammatory lung injury precipitated by
         chemotherapy-induced lysis of blasts within the lung.1,8,21,22 Leukostasis is well-described,
         with clearly defined diagnostic criteria that facilitate prompt recognition and treatment.18–20
         However, the clinical features of LI and ATLP in patients with AML have not been fully
         characterized.
                                                                                                                                  3

         The most extensive cohort of patients with leukemic lung disease to date was reported by
         Azoulay et al.23 These 20 cases, which were diagnosed based on clinical criteria, illustrate
         several important features including: (i) the proclivity for monocytic AML to invade the lung,
         (ii) the inconsistent association between circulating blast number and risk of LI, and (iii) the
         danger of ATLP after induction chemotherapy. This study also revealed the nonutility of
         bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in diagnosing LI, as blasts were usually absent from BAL fluid
         – a finding which corresponds with autopsies showing blasts in the interstitium and not the
         alveolar space.24 However, the study by Azoulay and colleagues was limited to patients in
         the ICU with rapidly progressive clinical courses. Subsequent case reports of LI and ATLP
         have focused on severe presentations as well.25–28
         Therefore, we sought to characterize the clinical and radiographic features of indolent forms
         of LI and ATLP. To do so, we selected patients with AML admitted to non-ICU settings. We
         also required bronchoscopic evaluation to enable rigorous exclusion of lung infection, which
         represents the primary differential diagnosis in such patients. In the resulting cohort, we
         found LI and ATLP to be quite prevalent, but rarely recognized during hospitalization due to
         their clinical resemblance to lung infection.
                                                                                                                                  4

         Methods
         Clinical Study Design
         We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients ≥ 18 years of age who were
         admitted between 2015-2019 to Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH), a 1,541-bed tertiary care
         center in Connecticut, USA. To identify patients with active AML and mild-to-moderate
         respiratory illness, the following were required: (i) pathologic demonstration of AML on bone
         marrow biopsy; (ii) peripheral blast count ≥3% indicating active leukemia; (iii) receipt of
         bronchoscopy with BAL to evaluate respiratory illness; and (iv) initial admission to a non-ICU
         floor.
         Determination of respiratory illness etiology
         We diagnosed patients with pulmonary infection if chart review identified any of the following:
         improvement of clinical status with empiric antimicrobial or antifungal therapy (as indicated
         by fever, hypoxemia, inflammatory biomarkers); positive serum fungal biomarkers; detection
         of respiratory viruses; or identification of bacteria or fungi by blood cultures, urine antigen
         testing, serum antigen testing (galactomannan or β-D-glucan), or lower respiratory cultures
         (except when deemed an obvious contaminant or colonizer by infectious disease and
         pulmonary consultants during hospitalization). Viruses were identified using a panel
         developed at YNHH as described previously29. BAL studies included bacterial cultures,
         fungal cultures, and viral nucleic acid detection. Specific testing for actinomyces spp.,
         nocardia spp., Legionella pneumophila, acid-fast bacilli, and cytomegalovirus testing was
         performed for all patients. Empiric antiviral therapy (beyond acyclovir prophylaxis) was not
         used in the absence of positive diagnostic testing.
         Diagnoses of noninfectious etiologies were made via chart review, with particular attention
         given to bronchoscopy results, drug exposures, autopsy and biopsy reports (where
         available), specialist consult notes, and clinical response to interventions. Cardiogenic
         pulmonary edema was diagnosed if the patient had (i) echocardiographic findings consistent
                                                                                                                                  5

         with heart failure; (ii) evidence of volume overload on imaging or physical exam; and (iii)
         clinical improvement with diuresis. DAH was diagnosed if the BAL demonstrated increasingly
         hemorrhagic appearance on sequential aliquots. Sterile pneumonitis (drug-induced or graft
         versus host disease (GVHD)) was diagnosed if the patient had (i) biopsy confirmation; (ii)
         multi-organ involvement of active graft-versus-host-disease; or (iii) clear exposure to a culprit
         medication. Sepsis-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed if the
         patient demonstrated (i) microbiological evidence of systemic infection and (ii) multi-organ
         dysfunction.
         The diagnosis of leukemic lung disease was based on exclusion of all etiologies above and
         supporting clinical evidence for either LI or ATLP. The following clinical features were
         considered supportive of LI: (i) a rising blast count in the 60 days preceding admission in
         patients with known leukemia; (ii) improvement in respiratory status following chemotherapy
         in those receiving treatment during the hospital admission; (iii) progressive decline and death
         due to end-stage leukemia; and (iv) non-response to all antimicrobial or diuretic therapy.
         Features supporting a diagnosis of ATLP included: (i) elevated peripheral blast count prior to
         induction chemotherapy; (ii) clinical and/or radiographic decompensation following
         chemotherapy accompanied by a drop in blast count within 2 weeks of treatment. Review of
         patient charts started from the time from AML diagnosis, included the hospitalization, and
         continued until time of death. Of note, none of the patients had chronic underlying pulmonary
         disease or hypoxemia. Also, due to the exclusion of patients with severe clinical
         presentations, no patients had leukostasis.
         To identify the final cohort with unambiguous leukemic lung disease, we required two
         additional criteria: comprehensive negative microbiological evaluation (respiratory, BAL,
         urinary and blood cultures, including potential contaminants or colonizers); and diagnostic
         confirmation by independent chart review by specialists in hematology, infectious disease,
         and pulmonology.

         Analysis of radiographic findings
         All chest CT scans performed during hospitalization and the accompanying radiologist
         interpretations were reviewed. Descriptions of specific radiographic features and suspected
         diagnoses reported by the radiologists were extracted and tabulated.
         Data collection and analysis
         Clinical data was obtained by the Joint Data Analytics Team at YNHH and medical record
         review. Data included demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory and imaging data,
         medication exposure, clinical interventions, and disposition. Data analysis was performed
         using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA) and the R software environment
         (version 3.6.0, Vienna, Austria). This study was approved by Yale’s institutional review board
         (#2000022465). Informed consent was waived due to the non-interventional study design.

         Results
         Identification of patients with indolent leukemic lung disease
         We identified 71 patients with active leukemia admitted with non-critical illness who
         underwent bronchoscopy; 51 patients with pathologically confirmed AML were selected for
         further analysis (Figure E1). We excluded 24 patients based on microbiologic evidence of
         respiratory or systemic infection, including 3 patients suspected of having sepsis related
         ARDS. Another 8 patients were excluded for non-infectious respiratory diseases, resulting in
         a final cohort of 19 patients.
         First, we sought to elucidate the etiologies of respiratory illness in the parent cohort of 51
         AML patients (Table 1). These were determined by detailed post hoc chart review as
         described in the methods. Unexpectedly, we found that leukemic lung disease was the most
         common etiology, observed in 37% of the cohort (19 patients), while only 20% had definitive
         clinical and microbiological evidence of respiratory infection. Additional etiologies – including
         sterile pneumonitis (8%), sepsis-related ARDS (6%), DAH (4%), and cardiogenic pulmonary
         edema (4%) – were comparatively rare. The remaining 20% were found to have a high
         likelihood of leukemic lung disease, but were excluded due to the stringency of the diagnostic
         criteria (detailed in the methods).
         Clinical presentation and hospital course
         The final cohort of 19 patients was subdivided into new AML (N-AML) and relapsed or
         refractory AML (RR-AML), which was defined by any receipt of induction chemotherapy prior
         to hospitalization. The clinical presentations and courses of individual patients are
         diagrammed in Figure E2, while summative data of the cohort is presented in Tables 2 and 3.
         Per study design, disease severity and blast counts were relatively low, as the average WBC
         count was 22x103/μL and no patients exceeded 100x103/μL. Based on current World Health
         Organization guidelines,30 all patients had non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (Table 1), with
         the most common subtype being AML with myelodysplasia related changes (47%).
                                                                                                                                  8

         N-AML
         Of the 7 patients with N-AML, 6 were treated with chemotherapy, while 1 had treatment
         deferred due to concern for infection. One of the six receiving chemotherapy demonstrated
         marked improvement in respiratory status – a phenomenon also observed previously in three
         patients with LI by Kovalski et al.31 The remaining 5 experienced worsening hypoxemia
         and/or radiographic infiltrates due to ATLP, although respiratory decompensation was
         attributed to infection in all cases at the time of hospitalization.
         In contrast to the patients reported by Azoulay et al, all of whom developed life-threatening
         ATLP within 48h of chemotherapy,23 we noted a marked delay in onset. Indeed, the average
         time to development of ATLP was 6 days, with one case manifesting 14 days after therapy.
         This difference may relate to the lower peripheral blast counts in our cohort. However,
         despite the modest blast counts and milder initial clinical presentations, the majority of ATLP
         cases still developed severe respiratory decompensation requiring ICU transfer (4/5
         patients).
         Interestingly, we also noted a subset of patients who showed negligible pulmonary signs and
         symptoms upon admission but developed severe ATLP after chemotherapy (2/5 patients).
         We suspect that these patients had ‘subclinical’ leukemic infiltration on admission, though
         this went unrecognized because of a lack of symptoms and imaging prior to chemotherapy.
         RR-AML
         Patients with RR-AML and leukemic lung disease demonstrated a highly characteristic rise in
         peripheral blast count during the weeks-to-months prior to hospitalization (Figure E2). They
         usually presented with fever (83%), respiratory symptoms (75%), and radiographic infiltrates
         (100%) that were caused by LI but attributed to infection at the time of hospitalization. In at
         least one case, this led to deferment of chemotherapy. Also, as in the N-AML group, we
                                                                                                                                  9

         observed one instance of marked clinical improvement after chemotherapy. Finally, we noted
         that only 3/12 patients were transitioned to comfort or palliative care despite their end-stage
         disease (11/12 died within one year), largely based on the perception that their
         decompensation was due to infection rather than progressive leukemia.
         General features
         All 19 patients with leukemic lung disease received heavy exposure to antimicrobial agents
         (Table 2), with a mean duration of 18 days of broad-spectrum antibiotics (maximum of 57
         days) and 10 days of treatment-dose antifungals (maximum of 48 days). The average
         number of blood cultures during admission was 11 with a maximum of 39 (all negative per
         inclusion criteria). Length of stay was quite prolonged, with a mean of 25 and maximum of 35
         days.
         Radiographic findings
         Two prior case series, which recruited 1 and 6 patients with AML, respectively, have reported
         the radiographic features of LI.32,33 The larger study suggested that septal and/or bronchial
         wall thickening may be a characteristic finding.33 However, in our cohort of patients with
         indolent LI, this was only observed in 25% (Table 4). Indeed, we found the radiographic
         appearance of LI to be highly variable and lacking in features that distinguished it from
         infection and other etiologies (Figure 2A-D). In contrast, ATLP predominantly manifested with
         ground glass opacities (80%), as exemplified by one patient who underwent CT scans before
         and after chemotherapy (Figure 2E-F). In both LI and ATLP, bilateral lung involvement was
         common. Also, in both diseases, radiologists frequently indicated concern for pneumonia,
         with more than half explicitly identifying infection as the leading diagnostic suspicion.
         Discussion
         The cohort presented here offers new insight into LI and ATLP, two common yet
         underappreciated pulmonary complications of active AML. Focusing on non-ICU patients, we
                                                                                                                                10

         provide the first descriptions of indolent forms of these diseases. Taken together with the
         work of Azoulay et al on severe LI and ATLP,23 our findings reveal a broad continuum of
         clinical presentations ranging from mild to fulminant. In fact, we also observed cases of LI in
         asymptomatic patients, which we designate subclinical LI. Thus, clinicians should be vigilant
         for the possible presence of LI in any patient with active AML, and for the risk of ATLP when
         treating such patients with chemotherapy – even if asymptomatic on presentation. Diagnosis
         of ATLP, in turn, should be strongly suspected in patients who develop respiratory symptoms
         after induction.
         As stated above, severe leukemic lung diseases such as leukostasis are often identified by
         clinicians, in part based on the dramatic elevations in WBC that usually accompany these
         conditions (i.e. hyperleukocytosis). In our cohort with indolent disease, however, diagnoses
         of LI and ATLP were missed with striking regularity. Instead, respiratory illness was invariably
         attributed to infection, resulting in delays in chemotherapy for treatment candidates and
         palliative care transitions for noncandidates. This occurred despite comprehensive testing
         including bronchoscopy, as well as multidisciplinary consultation with specialists in
         pulmonology, infectious disease, chest radiology, and hematology.
         The presumption of lung infection in these patients is partly explained by the limited
         specificity of diagnostic criteria for pneumonia – i.e. respiratory symptoms, systemic signs of
         infection (e.g. fever), and radiographic infiltrates – all of which occur commonly in leukemic
         lung disease.34,35 Conversely, establishing a definitive diagnosis of LI represents a challenge
         as well. This stems from the risks of obtaining biopsies for pathological confirmation,36,37
         nonutility of BAL studies,23 inconsistent association with peripheral blast number,23,38 and
         non-specificity of radiographic findings.31,33,38 Accordingly, LI is a diagnosis of exclusion in
         most cases.

         Since LI and pneumonia are virtually indistinguishable by standard clinical, radiographic, and
         pathological measures, a more tailored diagnostic approach is required. We would advocate
         for the following: (i) prompt radiographic and comprehensive microbiological evaluation
         including bronchoscopy; (ii) administration of empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy
         (as well as diuresis in appropriate patients); and (iii) diagnostic re-evaluation after finalization
         of infectious studies and completion of a defined course of empiric treatments. Negative
         microbiology and non-response to therapy may reasonably justify antimicrobial de-escalation
         and a tentative diagnosis of LI, especially in the presence of supportive features such as a
         concurrence between respiratory manifestations and rising blast count. In such cases,
         consideration should be given to cytoreduction for treatment candidates, especially given the
         marked clinical improvement observed after chemotherapy in multiple patients in our cohort,
         and previously by Kovalski et al.31
         However, as demonstrated by 5 patients in this study (4 of whom required ICU transfer), the
         risk for precipitating severe ATLP is significant even with relatively low peripheral blast
         counts, although onset may be delayed. Therefore, routine chest CT imaging may be
         indicated prior to chemotherapy to evaluate for LI. In those diagnosed with LI, gradual
         cytoreduction (e.g. with hydroxyurea) may be preferable to immediate induction. Prophylactic
         steroids may further mitigate the risk of ATLP as indicated by the work of Azoulay et al,39 and
         close monitoring for at least 7 days after chemotherapy is warranted based on the delayed
         onset of ATLP in our cohort. Meanwhile, the development of LI in treatment-refractory AML
         may be viewed as evidence of end-stage disease and justification for transition to palliative
         care.
         The prevalence of LI and ATLP in our cohort represents another notable finding of the
         present study. In contrast to the conventional view that leukemic lung disease represents the
         rarest cause of respiratory illness in AML, it was strongly suspected in the majority of our
         parent cohort (57%). These results are consistent with autopsy reports showing a 18-64%
                                                                                                                                12

         prevalence of LI in end-stage leukemics,11,17,40 and emphasize the need to maintain a high
         index of suspicion for this diagnosis in patients with active AML. Given the frequency of LI in
         this population, it may also present concurrently with infection, though our study does not
         address this question.
         The pathophysiology of LI and ATLP remains poorly understood, but recent advances in the
         biology of myeloid cells such as neutrophils may offer useful insight. For instance,
         myeoloblasts and neutrophils both demonstrate a tendency to marginate in the pulmonary
         vasculature,40–44 and the chemokine receptor CXCR4 is now recognized to be important for
         this effect in neutrophils.45 Given the association between CXCR4 and extramedullary
         infiltration, as well as heightened expression on monocytic leukemia (which tends to involve
         the lung), it is plausible that CXCR4 also mediates retention of blasts in the pulmonary
         vasculature.46,47 Extravasation, in turn, may proceed by mechanisms described by Stucki et
         al: i.e. activation of endothelial cells by blast-derived cytokines, upregulation of adhesion
         molecules on the endothelium, and transmigration.48 Finally, induction of ATLP during
         cytolytic chemotherapy could result from necrotic release of danger-associated molecular
         patterns (DAMPs) from blasts within the pulmonary vasculature and/or parenchyma, leading
         to pulmonary inflammation (and ground glass opacities on CT). While further studies are
         needed to confirm these postulations, it is tempting to speculate that CXCR4 inhibition prior
         to chemotherapy could promote neutrophil decampment from the lung and thus decrease the
         risk ATLP.
         The principal limitation to our study is the absence of pathologic confirmation of leukemic
         lung involvement. This represents a pervasive obstacle to diagnosing LI and derives from the
         risk of pulmonary hemorrhage when performing transbronchial biopsy in patients with AML,
         who are often severely thrombocytopenic. While autopsy represents a viable alternative for
         post hoc confirmation, it is usually declined by our patient population. Nevertheless, we
         believe the strict requirement for negative bronchoscopic studies, rigorous retrospective
                                                                                                                                13

         analysis of cases by independent clinicians from multiple specialties, and provision of
         objective patient clinical course diagrams (Figure E2) strongly support our diagnoses of
         leukemic lung disease. In fact, given the potential for LI to present concurrently with infection,
         it may be better diagnosed by clinical features rather than pathology alone, as the latter may
         underestimate the contribution of coinfection. Finally, prior studies which serve as the
         foundation for the literature in the field have demonstrated the validity of diagnosing LI by
         clinical criteria alone.23
         Other limitations include the retrospective and single center aspects of the study, which may
         have introduced bias related to patient selection for bronchoscopy (one of the central
         inclusion criteria). Indeed, there may have been patients with clinically obvious infection who
         were not referred for bronchoscopy, therefore increasing the relative proportion of patients
         diagnosed with leukemic lung disease in our cohort. However, since we strongly emphasize
         bronchoscopy in the evaluation of all patients with active AML and respiratory illness at our
         institution, this likely had minimal effect on the present study. Finally, we restricted our
         analysis to AML, both to maintain homogeneity in our study cohort, and to address the
         perception that infection is particularly prevalent in this population. As such, further studies
         will be necessary to see how well the clinical features reported here apply to other forms of
         leukemia.
         Further work is also necessary to elucidate the biological mechanisms of LI in order to
         develop improved diagnostics, treatments, and strategies to prevent ATLP. Such studies,
         along with heightened clinical awareness of leukemic lung disease, should help improve
         antibiotic stewardship in patients with AML, encourage chemotherapy administration where
         appropriate, and expedite care de-escalation in treatment noncandidates. Fortunately, efforts
         to standardize the management of respiratory illness and reduce antibiotic overuse in AML
         and other immunocompromising diseases are now underway.49
