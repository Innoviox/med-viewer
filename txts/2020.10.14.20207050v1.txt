42       ABSTRACT


43       With growing concern of persistent or multiple waves of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States,

44       sensitive and specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays remain critical for community and hospital-

45       based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Here, we describe the development and application of a

46       multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay (MMIA) for COVD-19 antibody studies, utilizing

47       serum samples from non-human primate SARS-CoV-2 infection models, an archived human

48       sera bank and subjects enrolled at five U.S. military hospitals. The MMIA incorporates prefusion

49       stabilized spike glycoprotein trimers of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and the

50       seasonal human coronaviruses HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, into a multiplexing system that

51       enables simultaneous measurement of off-target pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies. We

52       report the sensitivity and specificity performances for this assay strategy at 98% sensitivity and

53       100% specificity for subject samples collected as early as 10 days after the onset of symptoms.

54       In archival sera collected prior to 2019 and serum samples from subjects PCR negative for

55       SARS-CoV-2, we detected seroprevalence of 72% and 98% for HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-0C43,

56       respectively. Requiring only 1.25 µL of sera, this approach permitted the simultaneous

57       identification of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and polyclonal SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody

58       responses to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, further demonstrating the presence of conserved

59       epitopes in the spike glycoprotein of zoonotic betacoronaviruses. Application of this serology

60       assay in observational studies with serum samples collected from subjects before and after

61       SARS-CoV-2 infection will permit an investigation of the influences of HCoV-induced antibodies

62       on COVID-19 clinical outcomes.

66       INTRODUCTION


67                  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel zoonotic

68       positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA virus responsible for the third viral pandemic of the 21st

69       century, and the third zoonotic coronavirus outbreak in the past 20 years (1, 2). At this time,

70       SARS-CoV-2 has globally caused 34 million COVID-19 cases and over 1 million COVID-19

71       related deaths. A major concern of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been the frequent

72       reports of waning virus-specific antibody levels, with several studies reporting decay to

73       undetectable levels within just a few months after infection (3-5). While this is a measurable

74       feature of antibody response, it is also possible that current assays lack the sensitivity required

75       to detect lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. To date, a variety of antibody tests

76       have been developed with 38 tests granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the U.S.

77       Food and Drug Administration. The majority of these tests assess for antibodies against the

78       coronavirus spike (S) envelope glycoprotein, the primary target of virus-neutralizing antibodies

79       (6), in either its native-like oligomer conformation, or against one of its protein subunits or

80       domains. In general, most S glycoprotein antigen-based assays report the ability to detect

81       antibodies in 65-70% of infected individuals 8 – 14 days after symptom onset, with positivity

82       rates over 90% not occurring until 2 – 3 weeks after symptom onset (7).


83                  In this study, we describe the development, characterization, and utility of a

84       betacoronavirus (β-CoV) multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay (MMIA) for COVID-19

85       serology studies. To optimize sensitivity and specificity for measuring SARS-CoV-2 spike

86       reactive antibodies, the MMIA included prefusion stabilized S glycoprotein ectodomain trimers of

87       SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and the seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoV),

88       HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. The MMIA enabled the simultaneous measurement of relative

89       antibody quantities against each of these medically-relevant betacoronaviruses. We

90       hypothesized that this approach would potentially result in a highly sensitive and specific assay

 91       for detecting SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies through two mechanisms. First, the Luminex

 92       xMAP-based platform has a large dynamic range and has been shown to be more sensitive

 93       than ELISA for the detection of antibodies to other viral infections (8-10). Second, given the high

 94       seroprevalence of the common human betacoronaviruses (11-13), cross-reactive antibodies

 95       present in subject samples (14, 15) could be concurrently measured and accounted for in a

 96       multiplex approach. By testing for S glycoprotein reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the

 97       presence of HKU1 and OC43 S glycoproteins, the MMIA assay controls for off-target pre-

 98       existing cross-reactive betacoronavirus antibodies, thus enhancing specific SARS-CoV-2

 99       antibody detection. Additionally, the simultaneous incubation of serum with S glycoproteins from

100       all the relevant betacoronaviruses may enable a lower threshold for SARS-CoV-2 antibody

101       positivity.


102                  Utilizing serum samples from an experimentally challenged non-human primate (NHP)

103       model, together with human sera from subjects confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection and

104       from subjects confirmed to have other coronavirus infections collected prior to 2018, we report

105       the sensitivity and specificity performances for this assay strategy. Serum samples from rhesus

106       macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S

107       glycoprotein IgG seroconversion was detectable by 10 days post infection (dpi), consistent with

108       other reports demonstrating anti-S glycoprotein IgG seroconversion between 3 and 14 dpi (16-

109       19). As a result, we evaluated serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects collected 10

110       days after symptom onset and report 98% sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein IgG

111       antibody detection in humans at that time point. We also examined differences in SARS-CoV-2

112       antibody reactivity between widely used antigens: SARS-CoV-2 prefusion stabilized S

113       glycoprotein ectodomain trimer and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). High seroprevalence of

114       seasonal HCoV OC43 and HKU1, ranging from 97 – 98% and 55 – 89%, respectively, was

115       observed across both archival sera and SARS-CoV-2 negative subject serum samples. Through

116       this MMIA strategy we aim to investigate the interplay of pre-existing seasonal HCoV antibodies

117       on SARS-CoV-2 IgG duration, COVID-19 symptom presentation, and disease severity.

118       Preliminary data we have obtained using this multiplex serology strategy demonstrates that

119       SARS-CoV-2 antibody can be detected be detected early after the onset of symptoms and that

120       SARS-CoV-2 infection can stimulate an IgG antibody response that is cross-reactive with

121       SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV S glycoproteins.

123       RESULTS

124       Comparison of MMIA and ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody detection

125                  We first established our ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG and monitor SARS-CoV-2

126       seroconversion with sera collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected NHP. Purified IgG from SARS-

127       CoV-2 infected NHP collected 21 dpi were pooled and spiked into NHP negative sera, and the

128       MMIA was quantitatively characterized for IgG polyclonal reactivity revealing SARS-CoV-2 spike

129       antibody MFI curve linearity between 0.625 – 5.0 µg/ml or 3690 – 20,354 MFI (Figure 1).

130       Positive MMIA saturation occurs within 20,000 – 30,000 MFI. To investigate the effects of the

131       increased dynamic range facilitated by Luminex xMAP-based multiplexing systems on MMIA

132       sensitivity, we compared end-point titers by both ELISA and MMIA. In an ELISA, SARS-CoV-2

133       positive NHP sera end-point titers ranged from 1,000 to 2,000 (Figure 2A), consistent with

134       reported ELISA titers for these animals (16). In the MMIA, the ability to detect serially diluted

135       IgG antibodies was 4- to 8-fold greater than ELISA with end-point titers ranging from 4,000 (n=

136       2) to 16,000 (n= 1) (Figure 2B).

178       Figure 2. MMIA displays enhanced sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection. Serum

179       samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected NHP collected 21 dpi were tested by SARS-CoV-2 spike

180       protein (A) ELISA and (B) MMIA. (A) Dashed lines indicate 3-fold MFI above the NHP(-) serum

181       sample(s) diluted 1:1000 and 1:2000. (B) A solid line indicates the lower limit of MFI linearity

182       and a dashed line indicates 3-fold MFI above the NHP(-) serum sample diluted 1:4000. Positive

183       samples are those above both the MFI level for curve linearity and 3-fold change in NHP(-)

184       serum. MFI values represent MEAN±SD of two independent experiments performed in technical

185       triplicates.

186       Seroconversion in a non-human primate model

187                  Next, we monitored SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion with longitudinal NHP serum samples.

188       SARS-CoV-2 spike protein reactive IgG antibody seroconversion was observed in all four NHP

189       10 dpi (Figure 3A). We also investigated SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody seroconversion and

190       detected IgM level above baseline in two NHP by 7 dpi; all four NHP had detectable IgM by 10

191       dpi (Figure 3B). Notably, IgG antibody from SARS-CoV-2 challenged NHP did not significantly

192       react with spike proteins from betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV or HCoVs, included

193       in the MMIA (Figure 3A), whereas, a varying degree of IgM cross-reactivity was observed

194       (Figure 3B). Additionally, high baseline IgM reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD at 0 dpi inhibited our

195       ability to ascertain the dpi where seroconversion could be observed with this SARS-CoV-2

196       antigen (Figure 3B).

238       Archival sera from subjects with PCR-confirmed seasonal coronaviruses exhibit cross-reactivity

239       with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

240                  Despite low sequence similarity and identity between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and

241       seasonal HCoV spike proteins, antibody cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 proteins has been

242       observed (14, 15). To determine whether prior infection with seasonal HCoV induces antibodies

243       that cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, we assayed archival (pre-2019) serum from human subjects

244       with PCR-confirmed seasonal HCoVs. When setting a cut-off for positivity at three times the

245       mean MFI obtained for a mock antigen preparation-coupled microsphere, we observed that

246       8.89% (4/45) of archived serum samples from HCoV PCR-positive subjects cross-reacted with

247       SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Figure 4A-D). Cross-reactivity between HCoV-induced antibodies

248       with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was observed in subjects that were PCR-positive for OC43

249       (1/16), HKU1 (1/6) and 229E (2/10) infection.

290       Assay threshold cutoffs for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein reactive antibodies

291                  To control for pre-existing HKU1 and OC43 spike protein reactive antibody cross-

292       reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, rather than using a cutoff of three times the mean MFI

293       obtained for mock antigen, antibody threshold cutoffs were established with HCoV PCR-positive

294       convalescent sera (Figure 5A-B). A conventional 99.7% probability, mean and three standard

295       deviations higher, threshold cutoff was employed to distinguish positive and negative IgG

296       antibodies. The mean IgG reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was 1569 MFI with a 99.7%

297       probability threshold cutoff of 4911 MFI. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein had a notably higher

298       background IgG antibody reactivity and threshold cutoff, 2846 MFI and 7951 MFI, respectively.

299       Given the inherently less-specific nature of IgM, a 99.9% probability threshold cutoff was

300       preferred. The 99.9% probability threshold cutoffs for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and RBD

301       protein reactive IgM were 846 MFI and 15352 MFI. The remaining archival sera (n= 84),

302       representing HCoV PCR-positive acute sera, rhinovirus PCR-positive acute/convalescent sera,

303       and acute/convalescent sera from ‘no pathogen detected’ subjects, did not react with SARS-

304       CoV-2 spike protein or RBD protein above the established threshold cutoffs for either antigen

305       (Figure 5C-D). Although only 17%/7% of ARIC human subjects were OC43/HKU1 PCR positive,

306       we observed 97.6% OC43 and 89.2% HKU1 IgG, and none were IgM positive (Figure 5C-D).

307       Interestingly, the three OC43 spike IgM positive serum samples were collected from subjects

308       who had no pathogen detected by PCR.

342       Multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay performance

343                  Sera from persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened for IgG and IgM antibody

344       reactivity with betacoronavirus spike proteins in our MMIA. As SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion was

345       detected by 10 dpi in NHPs, MMIA SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG sensitivity for human

346       serology was evaluated in confirmed subjects ≥ 10 days post-symptom onset (dpso).

347       Additionally, a combination of archival human serum samples, and PCR negative MTF

348       hospitalized subjects and outpatients with serum samples collected < 30 dpso were included in

349       a negative agreement analysis. Subjects that were PCR confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 negative

350       displayed no IgG with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, whereas one subject had IgM reactivity to

351       SARS-CoV-2 spike protein above the 99.9% cutoff MFI value. A receiver operating

352       characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was then performed to further establish a more

353       conservative threshold value (1446 MFI cutoff point) for SARS-CoV-2 positive IgM (Figure 6A-

354       B). Further, HKU1 and OC43 IgG antibodies were observed in SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative

355       subjects (Figure 6A). SARS-CoV-2 reactive IgG antibodies were only detected above the 99.7%

356       threshold cutoff in the PCR positive subjects enrolled at military hospitals or the Javits Center

357       field hospital; cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV were observed in

358       SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and IgG positive subjects (Figure 6B).

394                  Performance assessments of this β-CoV MMIA for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG and

395       IgM detection are included in Table 1. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein reactive IgG antibody

396       detection was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as follows, sensitivity = 98.06%

397       (94.45% – 99.60% CI), specificity= 100% (96.82% – 100.00% CI). Assuming a US disease

398       prevalence of 1.0%, the positive predictive value (PPV) = 100.00%, and negative predictive

399       value (NPV) = 99.98% (99.94% - 99.99% CI). SARS-CoV-2 spike protein reactive IgM detection

400       sensitivity was lower than IgG, with performance analysis conducted with serum samples

401       collected ≥ 7 days post-symptom onset, sensitivity= 78.10% (68.97% to 85.58%), specificity=

402       100% (96.95% - 100.00% CI) and PPV= 100.00% (Table 1).

403                  When comparing spike protein and RBD, notably, utility of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for IgG

404       detection had a reduced sensitivity (87.10%, 80.78% - 91.94% CI) (Table 2). To assess MMIA

405       precision, three positive and one negative samples were tested over five independent

406       experiments, with at least two distinct in-house antigen-coupled bead lots and serum sample

407       freeze-thaws. Coefficient of variations (CV) were calculated for all three positive samples and

408       remained <20% (Figure 7). Although the negative sample had a > 20%, the MFI never went

409       above the threshold cutoff for positive IgG across five independent tests.

439       DISCUSSION

440                  In this study, we have demonstrated that use of a multiplex microsphere-based

441       immunoassay (MMIA) built using Luminex xMAP-based technology in which individual

442       microspheres are bound to pre-fusion stabilized S glycoprotein trimers of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-

443       CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and each of the two seasonal betacoronaviruses enables highly sensitive

444       and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. In contrast to commercial ELISA and

445       lateral flow assays for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, which typically have a sensitivity in the range of 65-

446       70% up to 14 days after symptom onset (7), the MMIA has a sensitivity of 98% at just 10 days

447       after symptom onset in PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Use of this highly

448       sensitive assay will allow for improved assessments of the kinetics of humoral responses to

449       SARS-CoV-2 infection.

450                  We hypothesize that the high sensitivity and specificity of the MMIA assay is due both to

451       the physics of the Luminex xMAP-based platform, which enables a high dynamic range of

452       measurement, as well as to the use of a multiplexing system. Multiplex microsphere-based

453       immunoassays have been shown to be more sensitive than standard ELISA for SARS-CoV-2

454       antibody detection (20) and several other virus infections, including Lassa virus, Ebola virus,

455       and simian immunodeficiency virus (8-10). Additionally, and perhaps more importantly,

456       simultaneously incubating serum against spike proteins of seasonal HCoVs may enable the

457       establishment of a lower threshold of positivity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Given

458       the presence of cross-reactive antibodies, assays that only test for antibodies against SARS-

459       CoV-2 may have to utilize a high signal threshold as a cut-off for positivity to reduce false

460       positive rates of detection. By incubating serum against multiple coronavirus spike proteins, the

461       MMIA platform may allow preferential binding of cross-reactive antibodies to the antigens of the

462       coronavirus against which they were initially induced, enabling a lower, and potentially more

464                  Now nine months into the COVID-19 pandemic, this β-CoV MMIA adds to an established

465       body of antibody tests and serology results. Early in the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 IgG

466       seroconversion was surprisingly detected early after exposure and sometimes in parallel with

467       IgM seroconversion (21-23). The temporal window to capture SARS-CoV-2 IgM is shorter than

468       IgG, and with IgG seroconversion occurring 10 dpi in NHP SARS-CoV-2 disease models, and

469       detectable as early as 7 dpso in subjects, there appears little benefit for continued SARS-CoV-2

470       IgM detection (Table 3). As we placed no upper limit on the dpso of the first serum collection

471       included in performance analysis, IgM sensitivity is lower than IgG driven by outpatient

472       enrollments in the EPICC, IDCRP-085 study on average 28 dpso that were IgG positive, but IgM

473       negative. Although less sensitive and less specific than IgG detection, the benefit of IgM

474       detection may lay in its ability to place a temporal window on SARS-CoV-2 exposure in

475       asymptomatic IgG positive individuals, particularly useful for cross-sectional studies of

476       seroprevalence.

477                  Conservation of epitopes present in the prefusion stabilized native-like trimeric S

478       glycoprotein oligomers may be the major factor in the observed cross reactions between the

479       CoV S glycoproteins. Since the RBD protein is only a domain within the S1 subunit of the S

480       glycoprotein and lacks potentially conserved protein residues with seasonal HCoV S

481       glycoproteins, utility in antigen-based immunoassays confers specificity for SARS-CoV-2 and is

482       thus employed in several antibody tests (24-27). We noted that in the present β-CoV MMIA, the

483       commercially sourced RBD protein, which shares an equivalent number of protein residues with

484       the expressed RBD protein used in a microsphere-based immunoassay developed by the

485       Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard (20), had a higher threshold cutoff that limited IgG

486       detection sensitivity compared to the spike protein. This reactivity to RBD may be driven by

487       artificial epitopes, exposure of epitopes otherwise inaccessible within the context of the native-

488       like S glycoprotein trimer or a product of microsphere coupling.

489                  Immunoassay detection of IgG antibodies that can bind to RBD has been used as a

490       surrogate for neutralization tests which require cell-culture, pseudoviruses, or biosafety-

491       containment and wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (25, 28, 29). SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies

492       target the S glycoprotein S1 subunit, particularly the RBD and N-terminal domains, and

493       sterically interfere with human ACE-2 receptor interaction (30-34). Yet, SARS-CoV-2 and

494       MERS-CoV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been identified that binds epitopes that do

495       not interfere with receptor engagement (35, 36). Furthermore, non-neutralizing antibody-

496       mediated protection has been observed in other virus infections, including HIV and Ebola virus

497       (37, 38). Given the relatively poor performance of this RBD protein in this β-CoV MMIA, and our

498       ability to capture the full-breadth of the humoral response, e.g., RBD-binding, neutralizing and

499       non-neutralizing, to SARS-CoV-2 infection with the native-like spike protein trimer (39), future

500       studies will exclude the monomeric RBD antigen from β-CoV MMIA strategy.

501                  The MMIA approach provided additional antibody detection data that is suggestive of

502       SARS-CoV-2 IgG cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Conserved cross-

503       neutralizing epitopes between MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins

504       have been identified (35, 40). Whether SARS-CoV-2 induced polyclonal IgG antibody responses

505       to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV spike proteins are retained after affinity maturation, or are

506       cross-neutralizing requires further investigation. Future studies with this MMIA will incorporate

507       spike proteins from the seasonal alphacoronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, to improve

508       upon specificity for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. We hypothesize that the inclusion of NL63

509       and 229E spike proteins will provide additional off-target control of cross-reactive antibodies to

510       SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, decreasing the threshold cutoff for positive SARS-CoV-2 and

511       enabling improved detection of waning and low positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. To attempt

512       to achieve similar success at detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and seroprevalence four

513       months after diagnosis (41), next steps in MMIA development will be focused on a re-calibration

514       of threshold cutoffs using archived sera in an MMIA that is limited to spike proteins from SARS-

515       CoV-2, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. Importantly, when utilized in

516       select subject cohorts from prospective, longitudinal observational studies in which serum

517       samples are obtained before SARS-CoV-2 infection, this MMIA approach has the potential to

518       measure antibody cross reactions with seasonal HCoVs, and investigate whether HCoV-

519       induced antibodies confer any protection against COVID-19.

520

521       CONCLUSION

522                  In summary, we have presented the development of a multiplex microsphere-based

523       immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 serology that includes envelope spike glycoproteins from

524       zoonotic, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and seasonal endemic betacoronaviruses, HCoV-

525       HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. Performance assessment of this immunoassay with serum samples

526       from a pre-2019 archived sera bank and SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive subjects who sought

527       medical treatment at military hospitals demonstrated 100% specificity for SARS-CoV-2 IgG

528       antibody detection and 98% sensitivity with samples collected as early as 10 days after the

529       onset of symptoms. Through this multiplex approach we are able to measure the potential cross

530       reactions of HCoV-induced antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins. Application of this

531       multiplex approach to prospective observational studies will enable the direct examination of

532       whether pre-existing HCoV-induced antibodies affect COVID-19 clinical outcomes, i.e.

533       asymptomatic presentation and symptomatic severity.

536       Recombinant protein antigens and microsphere coupling

537                  Prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S-2P glycoprotein ectodomain trimers (hereafter

538       referred to as spike protein) and SARS-CoV-2 RBD were purchased from LakePharma, Inc.

540       the NIH Vaccine Research Center designed SARS-CoV-2 S-2P protein, and the Mount Sinai

541       SARS-CoV-2 S-2P protein used in ELISA-based serology (26, 27, 42-44). Differences between

542       LakePharna, Inc. and VRC or Mount Sinai spike protein constructs are highlighted in the C-

543       terminus tags and selection of mammalian cell-line for expression.

544                  Design and expression of prefusion stabilized HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV-1

545       and MERS-CoV spike proteins have been previously described (15, 42). A mock antigen,

546       consisting of cell culture supernatant from untransfected HEK cells was collected via

547       centrifugation then filtered through a 0.22 µM PES filter to remove debris. Mock antigen-coupled

548       beads are included in each microtiter well to control for non-specific/artificial antisera binding;

549       samples that react with the mock antigen above an established 3-fold cutoff are retested. Spike

550       proteins were coupled to carboxylated magnetic MagPlex microspheres (Bio-Rad, Hercules,

551       CA) at a protein to microsphere ratio of 15 µg:100 µL, and antigen-coupled microspheres were

552       resuspended in a final volume of 650 µL following manufacturer’s protocol (Bio-Rad) for amine

553       coupling.


554       Non-human primate sera

555                  Archived sera were used from rhesus macaques inoculated with a total dose of 2.6x106

556       TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 via a combination of intranasal, intratracheal, oral and ocular

557       inoculation routes (16). Serum samples were collected at dpi 0 (baseline), 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14,

558       17 and 21. To purify serum IgG antibody, 250 µL of serum from each of four experimentally

559       infected NHPs collected 21 dpi were pooled then subjected to thermal inactivated for 30 minutes

560       at 60 °C. During inactivation, 2 mL of Protein G agarose, 50% suspension (Sigma-Aldrich, St.

561       Louis, Missouri, USA) was added to a chromatography column and the buffer was allowed to

562       flow through. The bead bed was then washed three times with 10 mL of PBS. Inactivated

563       pooled sera were diluted 1:5 in PBS then added to the column. Flow-through was collected,

564       then re-added to the column; this process was repeated for a total of three passes through the

565       column. The bead bed was again washed three times with 10 mL of PBS. Finally, IgG was

566       eluted from the Protein G agarose using a 0.1M Glycine elution buffer, pH 2.5 then returned to

567       neutral pH using 1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Eluted IgG was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra

568       Centrifugal Filter unit (Merck Millipore, Burlington, Massachusetts, USA), and the buffer was

569       exchanged to a 1X PBS buffer containing 25% glycerol.

570                  SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibody seroconversion was determined as the first dpi

571       where a 4-fold increase in the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured compared to

572       the baseline sera collection. Between the 1:250 and 1:1000 dilutions, some NHP IgG antibody

573       reactivities were no longer saturating the upper level of the MMIA. We chose further sera

574       screening at a 1:400 dilution, retaining the ability of the MMIA to detect positives at near MMIA

575       saturation, i.e. >20,000 MFI, while still within the linear region of detection.


576       Participant enrollment and sera collection

577                  SARS-CoV-2 negative human serum specimens utilized were from archived sera

578       collected between 2012 – 2018 in the Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program (IDCRP)

579       Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium Natural History Study (ARIC, IDCRP-045) (45). ARIC

580       sera predate the COVID-19 pandemic and were collected from subjects who had

581       nasopharyngeal swabs tested by nucleic acid amplification methods for virus etiologies of acute

582       respiratory infections; samples collected from individuals with rhinovirus and the seasonal

583       human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, -HKU1, -229E and -NL63 were used (46). In addition,

584       serum samples were collected since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 under the IDCRP

585       Epidemiology, Immunology, and Clinical Characteristics of Emerging Infectious Diseases with

586       Pandemic Potential (EPICC, IDCRP-085) protocol; a prospective, longitudinal study to analyze

587       COVID-19 disease. Subjects were enrolled at five hospitals across the continental U.S.,

590       San Diego, CA), Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC, Tacoma, WA) and Fort Belvoir

591       Community Hospital (FBCH, Fort Belvoir, VA). Subjects of all race and gender seeking

592       treatment for acute illness at these military hospitals were offered enrollment into the EPICC,

593       IDCRP-085 protocol. Study enrollment included subjects with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-

594       2 infection by nucleic acid amplification test, subjects with compatible illness in whom SARS-

595       CoV-2 infection is initially suspected but PCR confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 negative, and

596       asymptomatic subjects at risk of SARS-CoV-2 due to high risk exposure. In this study, 422

597       sera samples from 204 individual subjects were tested. The earliest serum samples collected ≥

598       10 dpso from subjects with longitudinal samples were included in positive performance

599       agreement. Additionally, serum samples from 35 subjects undergoing treatment at the COVID-

600       19 field hospital at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center (New York, NY) under the COVID-19

601       Antibody Prevalence in Military Personnel Deployed to New York (COVID-19 NYC) protocol

602       were included in the assessment of assay performance. EPICC, IDCRP-085 and COVID-19

603       NYC protocols were approved by the Uniformed Services University Institutional Review Board.


604       Multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay screening procedures

605                  Serum samples were collected from venipuncture in serum separator tubes, processed

606       and stored at -80 °C in 250 µL aliquots until use. For each 96-well plate, a multiplex master mix

607       of antigen-coupled microspheres was made by diluting 100 µL of each antigen-coupled

608       microsphere working stock into 10 mL (1:100) 1XPBS without calcium and magnesium (Corning

609       Inc., Corning, NY) (all mentions of PBS refer to solutions without calcium and magnesium), and

610       100 µL of this master mix were added to each well so that each well contained 1 µL (~23 ng) of

611       each antigen-coupled microsphere per well. Wells were washed with 1XPBS + 0.05% Tween20

612       + 0.02% sodium azide two times. One hundred microliters of each serum sample was added to

613       each well. Serum samples were initially diluted within a class II type A2 biological safety cabinet

614       (BSC) then subjected to thermal inactivation for 30 min at 60 °C, further serum dilutions are

615       noted in each respective figure legend. Human serum samples (1.25 µL) were diluted 1:400 in

616       PBS and tested in technical duplicate A and B plates. Controls on each duplicate plate included

617       a PBS blank (wells: A1, B1, G12, H12) and positive (C1, F12) and negative (D1, E12) non-

618       human primate serum. As testing progressed, PCR and serology confirmed human

619       positive/negative samples replaced non-human primate serum samples as the qualified controls

620       for inter- and intra-plate variation.

621                  Samples were incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes with agitation (900 rpm),

622       and plates were washed three times. Secondary antibody (goat anti-human IgG cross-absorbed

623       biotin-conjugated or goat anti-human IgM cross-absorbed biotin-conjugated; Thermo Fisher

624       Scientific, Waltham, MA) was diluted 1:5000 in 1XPBS + 0.05% Tween20 (PBST) and 100 µL of

625       each secondary was added to each well and incubated for 45 minutes with agitation, and plates

626       were washed three times. Streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Bio-Rad) was diluted 1:1000 in PBST and

627       100 µL was then added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes with agitation, and plates

628       were washed three times. Lastly, 100 µL of PBST was added to each well and plates were

629       resuspended by agitation for 5 minutes. Plates were read on Bio-Plex 200 multiplexing systems

630       (Bio-Rad) with PMT voltage setting to the High RP1 target and 100 bead count requirements.

631       The MFI for the four PBS blank wells on each plate were subtracted from the MFI of each

632       sample well and MFI values for samples are reported as the PBS adjusted average from

633       duplicate plates.


634       Threshold cutoffs for SARS-CoV-2 antibody

635                  To establish threshold cutoffs for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibody reactivity,

636       we tested 127 archival acute and convalescent human serum samples from ARIC. Acute and

637       convalescent serum samples were collected within approximately three and twenty-eight days

638       of symptom onset, respectively. A cut-off of three times the mean MFI obtained using a mock

639       antigen preparation coupled microsphere was initially used to determine positivity of cross-

640       reactive antibodies in archival serum samples. As cross-reactive antibodies were found to occur

641       in 4 out of 45 serum samples from archival HCoV PCR-positive individuals, we then established

642       a cut-off of three standard deviations above the mean (99.7% probability) MFI of these archival

643       HCoV convalescent serum samples (n= 43) to establish a positivity threshold for detection of

644       SARS-CoV-2 spike protein reactive IgG and IgM antibodies. The remaining 84 archival serum

645       samples were tested against this MFI threshold cutoff for SARS-CoV-2 reactivity. The 127

646       archival ARIC serum samples were tested in technical duplicates in three independent

647       experiments to establish threshold cutoffs and specificity for SARS-CoV-2.


648       Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay


649                  Flat bottom 96-well microtiter plates (Corning) were coated with 300 ng of SARS-CoV-2

650       spike protein per well diluted in 100 µl of ELISA coating buffer (1XPBS, 5.3g Na2CO3, 4.2g

651       NaHCO3, pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4 ૦C. The next day, spike protein was removed

652       and 125 µl of 5% BSA blocking buffer were added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at 37

          ૦
653           C. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein coated and blocked plates were then wasted plate three times

654       with 200 µl PBST. Serum samples were subjected to thermal inactivation after being initially

655       diluted in a BSC. Inactivated serum samples were then serially diluted 2-fold in PBS. One

656       hundred microliters of each dilution was added in duplicate to the antigen coated plate, sealed,

657       and incubated at 37૦C for 1 hour. Plates were then washed three times with 200 µl PBST. One

658       hundred microliters of secondary antibody, anti-human (H&L) HRP conjugated, diluted 1:5000 in

659       PBS to each well was added to each well and plates were incubated at 37૦C for 1 hour. Plates

660       were then washed three times with 200 µl PBST. Eighty-five microliters ABST Substrate

661       Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to each well and plates were agitated (900 rpm)

662       at room temperature for 30 minutes, then analyzed at 650 nm absorbance on a plate reader
