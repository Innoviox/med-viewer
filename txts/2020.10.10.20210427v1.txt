 9   Abstract:
10   The present work aims to give a contribution to the understanding of the highly infectious
11   pandemic caused by the COVID-19 in the African continent. The study focuses on the
12   modelling and the forecasting of COVID-19 spread in the most affected African continent,
13   namely: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and South Africa and for the sake of comparison
14   two of the most affected European country are also considered, namely: France and Italy. To
15   this end, an epidemiological SEIQRDP model is presented, which is an adaptation of the classic
16   SIR model widely used in mathematical epidemiology. In order to better coincide with the
17   preventive measures taken by the governments to deal with the spread of COVID-19, this
18   model considers the quarantine. For the identification of the model’s parameters, official data
19   of the pandemic up to August 1st, 2020 are considered. The results show that the number of
20   infections due to the use of quarantine is expected to be very low provided the isolation is
21   effective. However, it is increasing in some countries with the early lifting of containment.
22   Finally, the information provided by the SEIQRDP model could help to establish a realistic
23   assessment of the short-term pandemic situation. Moreover, this will help maintain the most
24   appropriate and necessary public health measures after the lockdown lifting.

28       1. Introduction
29   The year 2020 is and will be forever marked by the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the highly
30   infectious disease SARS-CoV-2. According to the World Health Organization, since its first
31   appearance in late 2019 in the Wuhan region of China, the Covid-19 has affected more than 6
32   million people and has caused the death of almost 400 thousand people worldwide, during the
33   first half of 2020. However, the spread of the disease and the damage caused by it did not
34   happen in the same way and at the same time for all continents. Indeed, taking the case of the
35   African continent, the COVID-19 pandemic reached a significant point by exceeding 180,000
36   cases in early June with more than 5,000 deaths. Although the pandemic has reached a
37   worrying threshold, the spread of the disease in Africa has not followed the exponential path as
38   in the rest of the world (e.g. Europe and United States). According to WHO’s analysis, the
39   relatively low mortality rate compared to other continents is likely due to the demographic
40   nature of the continent. Indeed, demographically, Africa is considered as the youngest
41   continent, with more than 60% of the population under the age of 25. However, the disease still
42   represents a danger for the African population, particularly, the South and African North. In
43   fact, according to the WHO, the above-mentioned regions account for more than 56% of the
44   cases recorded in Africa.
45   To date, in the absence of an effective vaccine or treatment against COVID-19, African
46   governments have taken several measures to limit the spread of the disease as much as possible
47   (e.g. quarantine, social distancing, lockdown, curfew, masks, etc.). Furthermore, during this
48   anti-COVID-19 battle, in addition to medical and biological research, theoretical studies based
49   on mathematical models can also play an important role in understanding the pandemic
50   dynamics (e.g. predicting the inflection point and of the end time). These models are therefore
51   an important decision-making tool for coping with this pandemic. Since the apparition of the
52   disease, the literature has witnessed an avalanche of work on modelling and predicting the
53   behaviour of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of these works have focused on China
54   [1-5], Europe [6-11] and the United States [7, 11-13], which is understandable because these
55   are the regions which were the first and most affected by COVID-19. Nevertheless, studies on
56   the African continent are practically negligible compared to those dedicated to the above-
57   mentioned regions [14-16].
58   The present paper aims to present a contribution on the modelling and the forecasting of
59   COVID-19 spread in the most affected African continent, namely: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia,
60   Egypt and South Africa. In addition, for the sake of comparison two European countries are
61   considered, namely: France and Italy. Thereby, an epidemic SEIQRDP model is presented,
62   which is an adaptation of the classic SIR model widely used in mathematical epidemiology. In
63   the next section, we present the data and the model. Section 3 presents the results of the
64   application of the model for the above-mentioned countries through the estimation of the
65   epidemic parameters and the adjustment of the model. The discussion of the results obtained as
66   well as a forecast analysis, are presented in the same section. The last section provides some
67   future directions for using the SEIQRDP model to control and prevent the spread of the
68   COVID-19virus.

 71       2. Data and Model
 72        2.1. Data
 73   The epidemiologic data of Covid-19 were provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for
 74   Systems Science and Engineering (JHUCSSE) [17], and derived from the official case count
 75   from the World Health Organization. The data provides the total number of confirmed,
 76   quarantined, recovered and death cases, for each country since January 22, the day that WHO
 77   announced an epidemic caused by a new coronavirus in China. Our preliminary study includes
 78   the most affected African countries and one of the main endemic foci in Europe, namely:
 79   Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, South Africa, Tunisia, France, and Italy. Figure 1 shows the
 80   cumulative reported cases of COVID-19 in the considered countries. The data refer to daily
 81   cumulative cases from January 22, 2020 until August 1st, 2020. It is important to note that
 82   these data are influenced by the capacity and strategy of countries in case detection. Some
 83   countries perform more tests than others. However, the provided data still provide indicator for
 84   tracking the trajectories of the epidemic. It can be well seen from figure 1 that the curve of
 85   newly detected cases in European countries is gradually flattening. On the other hand, there is
 86   an epidemic surge in the African countries, where the number of cumulative cases shows a
 87   different picture. Indeed, South Africa and Egypt are currently the countries with most known
 88   confirmed and deaths cases and the curve of infections still pointing mostly upwards.
 89   Unlike the last ones, the curve of cumulative cases is increasing less rapidly in Algeria and
 90   Morocco. Although Algeria has the highest number of deaths ahead the African countries.
 91   While, the curve of newly detected cases in Tunisia quickly flattened. Infection numbers have,
 92   however, also shown some signs of slowing down. It should be noted that the African continent
 93   is the last to be affected by the coronavirus. Indeed,
 94   The epidemic spread to Africa a few weeks after Europe, allowing its leaders to adopt
 95   preventive measures well in advance. South Africa, Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria imposed the
 96   lockdown and curfews before the epidemic had had time to spread. In addition, the low
 97   population density has considerably limited the transmission of the virus. Indeed, the
 98   inhabitants are generally concentrated in the capitals.

103        2.2. SEIQRDP Model
104   Using a pandemic modeling makes it possible to understand, describe and forecast its behavior
105   and its spread. Indeed, the mathematical models assess hypotheses, indicate trends, and help
106   develop public health responses by estimating risks, in real time, during an epidemic.
107   Nevertheless, modeling is a simplified representation of reality. Its precision is limited here by
108   the ignorance of certain factors and mechanism of propagation of COVID-19.
109   In this work, the SEIQRDP epidemiological model with seven different components, proposed
110   by [2] is used. The model is an adaptation of the classic SEIR model [18, 19], widely used to
111   study the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries with variations in components and
112   parameters for adaptations to regions and study period [16, 19-23]. The present model
113   considers the effect of quarantine adopted by many countries as an effective means of
114   preventing the spread. The stochastic SEIQRDP model is specified by the following system of
115   differential equations:

118   of susceptible cases (individuals who can contract the disease), the number of protected cases,
119   who have become insensitive to the disease, mainly by following the recommended protective
120   measures, the number of exposed case (individuals that have contracted the disease but not yet
121   infectious), the number of infectious cases (infectious individuals but not yet quarantined), the
122   number of quarantined cases, i.e active cases (confirmed and infected), the recovered and death
123   cases (individuals removed from the chain of transmission), respectively. The component of
124   protected part of people, namely, Pt , was introduced to reflect the growing awareness of the
125   population while respecting the lockdown. It should be noted that the total population N is
126   assumed to be homogenous, i.e. there is no birth or death and recovered people remain immune

131   the evolution of the epidemic, the health care and the screening capacities and are calculated
132   based on the daily numbers of confirmed, recovery and death cases. The infection rate  ,
133   represent the average number of contacts per-capita per time, multiplied by the probability of
134   successfully getting infected when coming into contact with an infected individual. While, the
      latent rate  , represent the average time for a latent individual to become infectious, which is
                       1
135
136   estimated within several days [4, 24]. Furthermore, the quarantined rate  1 represent the
137   average time for an infectious individual to enter in quarantine, which is considered to be
138   between 2 and 14 days [2]. Finally, to consider the measures taken by the different countries in
139   this study, we assume that the recovery rate t and the death rate  t are time dependent
140   function, as confirmed by [2, 21].
141   In case of a new disease as the COVID-19, the medical staff must learn new therapeutic
142   procedures and treat patients with new symptoms every day. Hence, the time of recovery,
143   cannot be a constant, because the recovery time at the start of the disease is longer, this means a
144   slower recovery rate which gradually increasing with time, considering the measures taken by
145   the governments. Consequently, we will assume that the recovery rate is modeled by following
146   function,
147                                                      t  0 1  exp  1t  ,                                             (2)
148   where 0 and 1 are the fitted coefficients [2].
149   Unlike the recovery rate, the mortality rate quickly decreases over time. This is due to the
150   medical assistance, the adaptation of the pathogen and the development of new treatments.
151   Hence, we will assume that the mortality rate is modeled by an exponential decay function
152   given as follows,
153                                                          t   0 exp  1t  ,                                                (3)
154   where  0 and 1 are the fitted coefficients [2].
155   However, one of the most discussed parameters in the current COVID-19 pandemic is the basic
156   reproductive number [2, 24-26]. Biologically, this number, represented by R0 , corresponds to
157   the number of new infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population. One
158   of the main reasons of the importance of the basic reproduction number is that it determines the
159   fraction of the population that needs to be immunized for the epidemic to start to decline. The
160   reproductive number will vary during an epidemic for two reasons. On the one hand, the public
161   health measures are put in place, like the lockdowns, social distancing, and other mitigation
162   strategies to keep the case count and death toll low in this pandemic. On the other hand, the
163   epidemic spreads and people who have recovered are protected against reinfection (at least in
164   the near future). Thus, the population becomes immune.
165   If the R0 is above 1, each infection breeds more, and the outbreak will continue to grow. When
166   it falls below 1, the outbreak will continue but at a lower death rate.
                                                                         5

167   In this study, the R0 is calculated by the next generation matrix method [22], based on a
168   endemic equilibrium, given by : S  N , P  E  I  Q  R  D  0 . We must solve the
169   equation, R0    FV 1  , where F and V are, respectively, the derivatives of the new
170   infections matrix F and the transition matrix V , evaluated at the endemic equilibrium and is
171   given by, 𝑅𝑡 = 𝛽 ∗ 𝛿 −1 (1 − 𝛼)𝑡 , where 𝑡 represent the number of days.
172   The nonlinear system of the SEIQRDP model given by (1.1) can only be solved using
173   numerical methods to observe the dynamics of the model. Firstly, we estimated the parameters,
174   namely,  ,  ,  1 ,  1 , t ,  t . In this step, we search the unknown parameters for the SEIQRDP
175   model by global optimization. This is done automatically by implementing the nonlinear least
176   square regression method. The optimization of the model parameters to describe the
177   experimental results was performed via the minimization of the sum of the squared errors
178   between the epidemiologic and the modeling data, during successive iterations, which finally
179   gives the best parameters for data fitting. It should be noted that the use of the cumulative data
180   should be avoided, since the cumulative incidence data are highly correlated, and the least
181   squares approaches relies on the fitting of independent data. Therefore, the use of daily new
182   data should be preferred, since these data are independent. Once all the parameters are known,
183   we can solve the system of differential equations (1.1).

185   The estimated parameters for the considered countries are given in Table 1, where we consider
186   the mean values of the recovery rate and deaths rate, t and  t , respectively .

189    The estimated parameter values are strongly linked to the discipline of the local population,
190   public health systems and the severity of the lockdown measures. Although there is so far no
191   gold standard for assessing the accuracy of the model parameters, the values of the obtained
192   parameters are in good agreement with the estimates given by [4, 27, 28]. The protection rate is
193   expected to remain very close to zero since there is currently no vaccine against COVID-19
194   [20] . It can be seen from table 1 that Tunisia shows the highest protection rates, which reflects
195   the increase of people infected with the new coronavirus after the opening of the country's
196   borders. The infection rate  values are in the range of the recent estimate by [4]. The lower it

197   is, the less an infected individual will be able to infect healthy individuals. However, Tunisia
198   shows a high infectious potential of the disease, compared to other African countries, which
199   confirms the result of the protection rate. The obtained latent rates (Table 1) are, also, in
200   agreement with the existing report [24], where Egypt has the longest latency period, which
201   explains the number of infected people exceeding 94,000 cases. This may be due the delay in
202   taking control and prevention measures against COVID-19. Notes that the latent period for
203   COVID-19 is limited to   0.2 : 0.5 , so a latency period between 2 and 5 days [24]. While,
204   Diekmann, Heesterbeek [22] notes that the average incubation period  1   1 for COVID-19
205   is between 2.1 and 11.1 days, this implies an infection rate limited to    0.1:1 . Therefore, a
206   quarantine period between 1 and 10 days. The estimation values obtained are within this
207   estimation range, where the smallest quarantine period is recorded in Egypt. However, the
208   parameters t and  t governing, respectively, the recovery rate and the mortality rate of the
209   disease, seems quite similar in the different countries, except for Egypt and Algeria. It is
210   interesting to note that the smallest value of t is recorded in Egypt compared to other
211   countries, which coincides with the results of the quarantine time obtained (Table 1). This is
212   probably due to an overload of the health system which implies a shorter average quarantine
213   period. This reflects the poor control of virus spreading by the low testing capacity and the non-
214   compliance with health security measures against coronavirus, especially in the most affected
215   areas of the country. On the other hand, Algeria has the highest value of the parameter  t ,
216   probably due to prevention and control measures as well as the dramatic improvement in
217   medical conditions, such as the use new treatment protocol as well as the strict compliance with
218   lockdown. The use of the quarantine considered by the current SEIQRDP model is based on the
219   separation of the healthy population from the asymptomatic population in order to prevent the
220   spread of the virus more quickly.
221   Figure 2 shows the effective reproduction number (𝑅𝑡 ) as a function of time for the different
222   modeled countries for the same period. Analyzing the effective reproduction number (𝑅𝑡 ) can
223   give us more information about how the pandemic dynamics unfolded and detecting in real
224   time the climax or turning point. Moreover, this figure is an indication of the speed and the
225   severity of the preventive measures as well as quarantine, adopted to reduce the average
226   infectious period by isolating certain infectious, so that they do not transmit the infection.

234   As can be seen, R t becomes less than 1 between early April and early June, about four to seven
235   weeks after the lockdown in the Maghreb countries (figure 2a-c). In fact, this shows the effects
236   of the lockdown, the quarantine and the strict curfews adopted to reduce the effect of virus
237   transmission, while for Egypt and South Africa, the R t has not crossed the line R t = 1
238   (mitigation phase), till end of June for Egypt and mid-July for South Africa. However, the
239   lowest infection kinetics is recorded in Tunisia and has generated a first R 0 = 4.690, much
240   lower than those of other African countries and that of Italy especially. For Egypt, the number
241   R t decreased more slowly due to relative delayed lockdown compared to the other countries
242   and an early lifting of the lockdown. However, the number of effective reproduction number
243   depends on the parameter δ, which governs the rate of transfer from the infectious class to the
244   quarantine class. Therefore, the use of quarantine to control the disease not only decreases the
245   size of the endemic infectious class, but also reduces the reproduction number R t below 1, so
246   that the disease vanishes.

247   The estimation results (Table 1 and Figure 2) indicate that the measures taken to prevent, and
248   control the epidemic taken by the governments have strengthened over time. Indeed, the
249   admission and follow-up of suspect cases, quarantine and treatment of confirmed cases
250   significantly affect the parameters values. As a result, the number of active (quarantined),
251   suspect, cured cases and the deaths predicted by the SEIQRDP model tend to decrease over
252   time. On the other hand, the accuracy of long-term forecasts will also decrease.
253   Figure 3(a-g) present the forecasts of actives (quarantined), recovery and death cases of the
254   COVID-19 pandemic in the considered African countries and European depending on
255   quarantine policy considered by the SEIQRDP model. While, Figure 4 presents the forecasts of
256   the COVID-19 pandemic for France, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia for the period after the
257   lifting of the lockdown.
258   Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the potential of the SEIQRDP model to predict the trend of
259   pandemic dynamics. As can be seen from Figure 3, the curves follow roughly the same trend
260   except for the two most affected African countries, namely, Egypt and South Africa. From
261   Figure 4, we note that the curves follow the same trend to those of Figure 3, where we notice
262   some non-homogeneity of the data. The curves show the potential of the model to predict the
263   trend of pandemic dynamics. Consequently, for the forecasts of the pandemic dynamics of
264   Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and France, we consider the results appearing in Figure 4.

275
276   As Figure 3 shows, we find that there is a good fit between the model fitting results and the
277   actual COVID-19 data in each country under the optimized SEIQRDP model. Therefore, it
278   could be considered relatively reasonable to use the optimal model to predict the current
279   epidemic situation in other countries. In addition, it is estimated that countries lockdown and
280   closure strategies would have avoided considerable loss and millions of infections. These
281   results show that these measures are important and necessary to respond to this serious public
282   health emergency.
283   For some countries, namely, France, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, we notice a bad adjustment
284   between the results of the SEIQRDP model and the actual COVID-19 data, after the lockdown
285   lifting given by the following dates, 11 / 05, 14/06, 11/06, 04/05/2020, respectively. This can
286   be explained by the ignorance of health security measures after the lockdown lifting. In
287   addition, the present model, namely the SEIQRDP model, does not take into account such
288   shocks or changes in the situation, given the very limited testing capacity, infected people can
289   spread the virus if they do not comply with health security measures and they are not
290   quarantined, remember that this component is very important in the model, and ignorance of
291   the latter can affect the results of the model. Therefore, we only consider the data after the
292   lockdown lifting to plot the forecasts of the countries in question. Figure 4 present the forecasts
293   of active cases, recovery and death from the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic by the
294   SEIQRDP model adapted after the lockdown lifting.

295   Based on this model, the epidemic in Italy is in its final phase and should end by September.
296   Other countries like Morocco and Algeria are expected to get rid of COVID-19 by the end of
297   October. States like Egypt, South Africa must wait until the end of this epidemic until
298   November. While for Tunisia and France they experience a considerable increase in the number
299   of infected cases and an end to the epidemic is not predictable at this time. However, these
300   forecasts would still be accurate over a short period, given the sensitivity of the model to the
301   value of  , which in turn also depends on the number of contacts per person and per unit of
302   time. This implies that the number of cases in the future could decrease or increase
303   considerably depending on the health security measures and the respect of these measures by
304   the population.
305   The Maghreb has been relatively spared by the pandemic of the new coronavirus, compared to
306   Europe, especially, the most affected (France and Italy).
307   These Maghreb countries took precautionary measures very early on with border closings,
308   general lockdown, social distancing or the wearing of protective masks. These proactive
309   measures, dictated by the fragility of the hospital system in each country, have so far prevented
310   the epidemic tsunami noted in France but also in Italy, as shown in Figure 3(f-g), where the
311   peak of infected people reached around 10E6 infected in France and Italy, compared to the
312   epidemiological situation is generally reassuring in the Maghreb nevertheless hides trajectories
313   which diverge appreciably, after having been similar for a long time. Indeed, with more than
314   30.900 confirmed and 1.200 deaths cases, Algeria is the country with the most worrying
315   situation in the Maghreb. Indeed, from Figure 3b, the number of cases confirmed daily begins
316   to decrease after reaching its maximum. We note that there was a slight decrease in daily cases
317   in April which seems to be explained by a low number of tests and the random rules of the
318   lockdown. With approximately 6.500 tests performed, only cases with advanced symptoms
319   appear to be counted. After this plateau of active cases in April, there was a worrying return
320   until the end of May. However, according to Algerian COVID-19 forecasts by the SEIQRDP
321   model (Figure 4b), the situation will begin to stabilize. the number of recovery cases will
322   increase exponentially, and the number of death cases will also stabilize despite the fact that it
323   has not grown significantly compared to the European countries. The gradually flattening in
324   deaths is may be due to the use of the chloroquine treatment protocol [29].
325   However, Morocco will soon cross the threshold of 25.015 positive cases with more than 360
326   deaths. After a peak around early May, a decline in late May, the resumption of daily cases in
327   early May worried the health authorities. This can be explained by the non-compliance with the
328   rules of social distancing rules and sanitary rules during groupings, it should be noted that most
329   new cases were attributed to contact cases. Regarding the forecast for Morocco (Figure 4a), the
330   curves of the recovered cases seem to increase contrary to the curves of infected after the
331   lockdown lifting. Indeed, the country has allowed the reopening of cafes, restaurants and sports
332   halls as well as the resumption of domestic tourism and interurban travel. On the other hand,
333   the death curve tends to zero. This encouraging result may be explained by a better knowledge
334   of the disease [30].
335   With just over 1.550 cases tested positive and around 51 deaths, Tunisia is the least affected
336   country of the three Maghreb countries by the pandemic. According to Figure 3c and Figure 4c,
337   there is a decrease in active cases after a peak in mid-April, followed by a second significant
                                                                        12

338   peak predicted approximately in mid-October, due to the lockdown lifting. The curve of active
339   cases (Figures 3c and 4c) describes well this reassuring trend, with a peak in mid-April and a
340   drop which accelerated at the beginning of May to reach 0. This confirms the adequacy of the
341   proposed SEIQRDP model. In addition, we notice a lower mortality rate compared to other
342   countries as well as a significant recovery rate coupled with the low number of new cases
343   which have eased the pressure on the hospital system. As for its Maghreb neighbors, Tunisia
344   resorted to a treatment based on chloroquine [31]. However, according to the result of forecasts
345   by the SEIQRDP model, the results are encouraging and confirms the end of the health crisis
346   with a few scattered daily cases by the early August. However, for Egypt and South Africa
347   (Figure 3d-f), the disease manifests itself in different ways compared to the Maghreb. Indeed,
348   we note that the trend of the curves is almost the same from mid-March to July. Nevertheless,
349   the two countries already stood out with a higher number of cases than the other countries
350   during this same period.
351   was in the first place in terms of death until mid-July when the south of Africa is now the
352   country most affected by the coronavirus in terms of death
353   Egypt currently has nearly 94.320 cases and around 4.830 deaths for a population of 100
354   million inhabitants. Until mid-July, the Egypt recorded the highest number of deaths,
355   afterwards, South Africa became the most affected country in terms of deaths, despite the
356   rigorous preventive measures. The situation in Egypt may be explained by the poor health
357   system [32] and the wave of patients COVID-19 which is growing day after day. However, the
358   results of the SEIQRDP models correspond very well to the provided data. Regarding the
359   forecasts of the pandemic in Egypt (Figure 3d), the results show that the number of infected
360   cases continues to increase rapidly to reach the peak around the end of August. While, the
361   number of recovered cases will increase less rapidly, whereas, the number of deaths cases
362   remains high compared to the Maghreb and continue to increase. This stabilization in death
363   cases may be explained by the recent use of the drug Remdesivir to treat the patients [33]. This
364   treatment was authorized a few days ago in the United States and Japan, based on a positive
365   American clinical trial[34].
366   South Africa tops the list of countries most affected by coronavirus (in terms of contamination).
367   To date, there have been more than 503.290 cases of COVID-19 and around 8.153 deaths.
368   From Figure 3e, we note that infected cases have experienced significant increase since the
369   beginning of May and continues to increase. This is due to the lockdown lifting for certain
370   industrial sectors, with a 1.5 million people who have been authorized to return to work, under
371   strict health protection. Whereas, before these, the situation was under control because the very
372   strict measures taken from the beginning made it possible to slow the progression of the
373   pandemic of coronavirus. However, the curve of restored cases continues to grow and exceeds
374   the infected cases since mid-May despite that the latter continues to increase. This can be
375   explained by the community screening and testing (CST) operation in working-class
376   neighborhoods. This massive campaign made it possible to isolate infected people as quickly as
377   possible and trace their contacts. This massive campaign partially explains South Africa’s
378   success in the very slow development of the epidemic compared to other African countries for
379   the same period (Figure 3a-e). Regarding the number of deaths, we note that it is stable so far,

384   Africa by the SEIQRDP model (Figure 3e), the situation will stabilize in terms of infected and

388      4. Conclusion
389   In this paper, mathematical model for the coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic development is
390   performed for the most affected African countries based on an epidemiological SEIQRDP
391   model, which is an adaptation of the classic SIR model widely used in mathematical
392   epidemiology. The SEIQRDP model takes quarantine into account to match with the medical
393   security measures adapted by many countries as an effective way of preventing the spread of
394   the coronavirus COVID-19. Furthermore, considering all major parameters of the progression
395   of the coronavirus, several analytic results established, while proving all the necessary
396   properties for epidemiological relevance. This model allowed us to estimate the main epidemic
397   parameters and forecast the evolution of the reproduction number of the disease over time in
398   order to assess the epidemic situation and the effect of the applied preventive health measures.
399   An acceptable agreement between the statistical data and the curves of the model was
400   established. This indicates the suitability of the SEIQRDP in modelling the spread of the
401   COVID-19 disease for the considered countries.
402   On the other hand, according to the statistical, fitted and predicted curves, we noticed that the
403   epidemic peaks are between mid-April and mid-August, after which the epidemic declines.
404   This situation can be explained by the policy adopted by African countries, aimed at effectively
405   combating this virus. In addition, this confirms the effectiveness of the lockdown measures and
406   curfews taken early enough to slow the spread of the disease. Most countries have implemented
407   these measures as soon as the first case is detected. In France, it took 52 days after the first case
408   to take such measures. In addition to this factor, there are many other factors that contribute to
409   the robust and rapid response of these countries. The other main explanation is the youth of the
410   African population, around 60% of the population under 25 years of age. In addition, the
411   population density is lower in Africa, thus limiting the spread of the virus, as is the low
412   mobility of African populations in comparison with Western populations, where most of the
413   cases remain concentrated in the capitals and large cities.
414   However, caution should probably follow. A general lockdown lifting seems unlikely, while
415   the gradual lifting of lockdown experienced by the countries under study by city, depending on
416   the mortality rate and the number of new infections observed, may be reasonable in compliance
417   with the measures of security. However, Algeria and Tunisia may experience new peaks
418   expected mid-October, due to the lifting of lockdown, where countries have allowed the
419   reopening of cafes, restaurants and gymnasiums as well as the resumption of tourism domestic
420   and interurban. Nevertheless, the three Maghreb countries will have to strengthen the control of
421   health measures, to avoid the epidemic resumption. The crucial element will remain the
422   generalization of tests which will remain one of the main ingredients in the fight against
423   epidemics in the country. All these precautions will effectively reduce the number of basic
                                                                        14

424   reproductions at each interaction, which is considered a crucial parameter during a pandemic
425   used to estimate the risk of an outbreak of COVID-19 and assess the effectiveness of the
426   measures implemented.
427   Finally, the epidemiological situation is reassuring in the three Maghreb countries, while for
428   South Africa, the situation seems controllable, mainly due to the CST operation. However, in
429   Egypt the number of infected cases continues to increase, the situation comes mainly from
430   ignorance of physical distancing measures and the violation of curfews after the last relaxation
431   of the restrictions in mid-March. In fact, without control of the population and lack of effective
432   treatment and vaccine, there will be no way to prevent the death of many people. Furthermore,
433   hospitals will be flooded and will never be able to manage the pandemic.
