   ABSTRACT
   Introduction
   Ideally, health conditions causing the greatest global disease burden should attract increased
   research attention. We conducted a comprehensive global study investigating the number of
   randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published on different health conditions, and how this
   compares with the global disease burden that they impose.
   Methods
   We use machine learning to monitor PubMed daily, and find and analyse RCT reports. We
   assessed RCTs investigating the leading causes of morbidity and mortality from the Global
   Burden of Disease study. Using regression models, we compared numbers of actual RCTs in
   different health conditions to numbers predicted from their global disease burden (Disability-
   Adjusted Life Years [DALYs]). We investigated whether RCT numbers differed for conditions
   disproportionately affecting countries with lower socio-economic development.
   Results
   We estimate 463,000 articles describing RCTs (95% prediction interval 439,000–485,000) were
   published from 1990 to July 2020. RCTs recruited a median of 72 participants (interquartile
   range 32–195). 82% of RCTs were conducted by researchers in the top fifth of countries by socio-
   economic development. As DALYs increased for a particular health condition by 10%, the
   number of RCTs in the same year increased by 5% (3.2%–6.9%), but the association was weak
   (adjusted R =0.13). Conditions disproportionately affecting countries with lower socio-economic
                 2
   development, including respiratory infections and tuberculosis (7 thousand RCTs below
   predicted) and enteric infections (10 thousand RCTs below predicted), appear relatively under-
   researched for their disease burden. Each 10% shift in DALYs towards countries with low and
   middle socio-economic development was associated with a 4% reduction in RCTs (3.7%–4.9%).
   These disparities have not changed substantially over time.
   Conclusion
   Research priorities are not well optimized to reduce the global burden of disease. Most RCTs are
   produced by highly developed countries, and the health needs of these countries have been, on
   average, favoured.

    KEY QUESTIONS
    What is already known?
          ●   Prior studies have manually investigated the relationship between published research
              in different health conditions and the global burden of disease that they impose.
          ●   However, these analyses have been mostly limited to estimates of research funding
              from national funders, or smaller scale analysis of older publication records.
          ●   These studies have highlighted disparities in research relative to burden, but they are
              not sufficient to enable global targeting of research to optimise improvements in
              disease burden.
    What are the new findings?
          ●   We automatically process all of PubMed, allowing us to conduct a continually updated,
              comprehensive analysis of published reports of RCTs, including the number of
              participants per RCT and the health conditions studied.
          ●   We found that considerable disparities exist between the relative volume of evidence on
              some conditions and the global burden of disease that they impose, as calculated by the
              Global Burden of Disease study.
          ●   Further, our analysis suggests that there exists a smaller amount of evidence for
              conditions that impose a comparatively large burden of disease in lower-income
              countries.
    What do the new findings imply?
          ●   Looking at numbers of RCTs published, and the numbers of participants in these trials,
              it seems that research priorities are not optimized to reduce the global burden of
              disease, and that research for conditions affecting higher-income countries has, on
              average, been favoured.
          ●   The findings from this study could help research funders to focus research investment
              in areas where the largest reductions in disease burden could be made.
   Introduction
   The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study has estimated the leading causes of death and
   disability worldwide.[1] Health inequalities have been defined as differences in health which are
   avoidable, remediable, and considered unjust.[2] A key strategy to reduce death and morbidity is
   to conduct randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the effects of interventions for
   improving health.[3] However, RCTs are expensive and time-consuming, and there is necessarily
   a limit on the number and size of these types of study that can be carried out. There are very

   many factors which could reasonably affect which health problems are researched, not limited to:
   the existence of highly effective treatments for certain conditions (where poor implementation or
   availability is the problem); national governments prioritising conditions which affect their own
   country’s population; and the unpredictable nature of scientific breakthroughs in therapy.
   Pharmaceutical companies are likely to develop drugs which have the potential to be sold at
   profit; this can lead to neglect of conditions (e.g. infectious diseases) which disproportionately
   affect low income countries.[4] Nonetheless, a rational approach to funding research — reduce
   health inequalities and maximise global benefit — would take account of the global disease
   burden.
   Studies from the US and the UK have reported that disparities exist in national health research
   funding for certain conditions. Some conditions, such as diabetes and cancer, have attracted a
   comparatively generous amount of research funding in these countries relative to their national
   and global burden, whereas other conditions, such as stroke and respiratory diseases, have been
   relatively neglected.[5–8] In a later study, Evans and colleagues mapped the volume of research
   (RCTs and systematic reviews) published in 2005 to conditions studied in the Global Burden of
   Disease (GBD) study. They concluded that global Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs; a
   measure that incorporates the quality of lived years with respect to physical and mental
   functioning criteria) in 2004 did not explain any of the topic distribution of research articles
   published in the following year.[9] By contrast, Atal and colleagues examined 117,000 new
   registrations for clinical trials globally from 2006–2015, and reported that trials registered were
   proportionate to disease burden in high-income countries, but not in non-high income
   countries.[10]
   To our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive, global study comparing published research
   (both in terms of trial and participant numbers) with the relative burden of each condition. We
   address this gap by evaluating the total volume of evidence (numbers of RCTs and trial
   participants) published for clinical conditions via an automated analysis of all research articles
   indexed in PubMed (http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) from 1990 onwards. Our system uses
   natural language processing to automatically identify text within articles that describes the
   conditions being studied, and maps these to GBD-defined categories. This permits comparison
   between the global disease burden and the amount of published evidence that exists for each
   condition, and could help prioritise research funding to relatively understudied conditions with
   high burden. Uniquely, as our method is fully automatic, we are able to analyse articles at large

   neither of which have been feasible so far with manual methods.
   Methods
   Overview
   We developed a machine learning system which maintains a live database of annotated RCT
   reports, named Trialstreamer. We have described the computational methods and accuracy of the
   system components in detail elsewhere,[11] and summarize the key points relevant to the current
   study below.
   Monitoring PubMed for RCTs in humans
   We first downloaded the full PubMed database (annual baseline data, from 11th December 2018)
   and then subsequently monitored and added all newly published articles daily. This comprises
   >30 million articles. We automatically identify the subset of articles that describe RCTs using a
   machine learning system, which operates over the text of the title and abstract, and the
   Publication Type database index.[12] Briefly, we ensemble a Support Vector Machine (SVM)[13]
   and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).[14] These machine learning models are trained1 on
   280,000 abstracts manually labelled as being RCTs or not by Cochrane Crowd,2 a collaborative
   citizen science project. We do not rely on the Publication Type index alone, as we have previously
   found it to miss a substantial proportion of the 5–7 most recent years of articles[11] (due to delay
   in manual indexing after publication). We next removed any RCTs that were not conducted in
   humans (e.g., animal or agricultural studies) using an SVM model. This model was trained using
   labelled abstracts from PubMed (labels derived as a function of whether the MeSH3 term
   ‘Humans’ had been applied or not).
   Automatic information extraction
   To characterise the trial participants and outcomes, we first automatically extract ‘snippets’ of text
   (typically a few consecutive words within the abstract) describing these components. For this, we
   use a sequence tagging machine learning model (namely a Long Short-Term Memory network[15]
   1
     Model ‘training’ describes the process of adjusting model parameters to align with (typically large amounts of)
   data. Here, the models consume text documents (abstracts), with manual labels designating whether these are
   RCTs or not. Once trained (i.e., once the parameters are estimated) the model can be applied to new, unseen
   abstracts to provide predictions.

   (NLM) and used for indexing articles in the MEDLINE database.

   followed by a conditional random field,[16] usually abbreviated to LSTM-CRF[17]).[18] This model
   was trained using a publicly available dataset called EBM-NLP, which comprises 5,000 RCT
   abstracts in which text spans relevant to the respective PICO characteristics (participants,
   interventions, comparators, and outcomes) were manually annotated.
   These text descriptions are then standardised to MeSH terms. This allows us to infer, for
   example, that ‘myocardial infarction’ and ‘heart attack’ refer to the same condition, and that both
   are subtypes of cardiovascular disease. To achieve this step, we use an approach similar to that
   described by Demner-Fushman and colleagues, in their MetaMap software.[19] This approach
   involves generating a large database of text synonyms for MeSH terms, done by finding
   alternative descriptions for each term in linked vocabularies. These synonyms are then sought in
   the extracted population and outcomes text spans.
   Linking RCTs with data on global disease burden
   In this study, we use the 22 level 2 categories defined by the GBD collaboration. These categories
   describe broad disease areas such as “Cardiovascular diseases”, and “Mental disorders” (the full
   list is provided in Table 1). The GBD collaboration makes available International Classification of
   Diseases (ICD-10) codes which define the scope of each category. We automatically link these
   ICD-10 codes to the equivalent MeSH terms using a tool and dataset named Metathesaurus, from
   the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).[20] In brief, Metathesaurus provides a database
   of synonyms between different health science vocabularies, and thus lists of synonymous terms
   between ICD-10 and MeSH can be retrieved. One clinical author (IJM) manually checked all of
   the automatically generated mappings from MeSH to Global Burden of Disease category (both
   removing any errors from the automatic mapping, and adding links where they had been
   missed). This resulted in a final mapping of 5,256 parent MeSH terms to one of the 22 GBD
   categories.
   Descriptive statistics
   We report descriptive statistics for RCT counts and participant numbers. We use the country of
   the first author’s affiliation as a proxy for the country organising or funding the study. In order to
   capture trials addressing prevention, we also consider RCTs as relevant to the GBD category
   where rates of the health condition in question are identified as an outcome, even where
   participants did not have the condition at trial onset. For example, trials that recruited people with
   diabetes but measured the effects of an intervention on subsequent coronary heart disease were
   considered as relevant to both the ‘diabetes’ and ‘cardiovascular diseases’ categories. We also

   present separate estimates based on this distinction, that is, separating instances where a given
   GBD condition was found in the trial population (‘treatment’ trials) from those where it was
   inferred to describe an outcome (‘prevention’ trials).
   Estimating uncertainty due to prediction error
   We randomly sampled articles (titles and abstracts) from the finalised dataset, and two authors
   independently manually labelled these with respect to study design (RCT in humans vs. not; 500
   abstracts, done by IJM and BCW), Global Burden of Disease category (250 abstracts, done by IJM
   and VL), and number of participants randomized (500 abstracts, done by IJM and BCW). Authors
   then met to resolve discrepancies by consensus. We then used the bootstrap method to estimate
   95% prediction intervals for final counts, using the method described by Fox and
   colleagues.[21,22] In short, we use our manually labeled data to calculate 10,000 bootstrap
   estimates of the precision and recall of each labeling task.[23] These precision and recall estimates
   are then used to adjust the automated results from the full dataset (generating 10,000 adjusted
   count estimates for each classification task), which can be used to construct a 95% prediction
   interval. To evaluate uncertainty around extracted sample sizes we use a similar approach, except
   we used estimates of the absolute error taken from the manually labeled abstracts. We then
   simulated the effect of this error on the full dataset using the bootstrap method with 10,000
   iterations. These intervals permit assessment of the degree to which model misclassification and
   bias has affected the final results.
   Assessing associations between disease burden and published RCTs
   To examine associations between global disease burden and volume of evidence (both numbers
   of RCTs and participants), we used a series of linear regression models with log-transformed
   global DALYs as the predictor, and the log-transformed numbers of global RCTs as the
   dependent variable. We evaluate annual data on DALYs for each clinical condition for the full
   period available from the Global Burden of Disease study (1990–2017), and adjust for trends over
   time by incorporating the year as a categorical predictive variable. A detailed description
   alongside statistical code and data for these analyses is available at the Open Science Framework
   (DOI: 10.17605/osf.io/3db76).
   In our first regression analysis, we examined the association of global DALYs on RCT
   publications in the same year. We explored incorporating the year (as categorical variable) both as
   a fixed and a random effect, evaluating using the Hausman test. We compare observed RCT
   counts for each GBD condition with those predicted by the model.

                                      It is made available under a CC-BY 4.0 International license .
   In our second regression analysis, we examine the effect of lag (given that RCTs will publish
   reports some time after measures of disease burden are known). Here we use finite length
   distributed lag models, and evaluate the association of global DALYs with up to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
   years lag on published RCTs in the index year. We compare models using the adjusted R2
   statistic, the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC).
   In our third regression analysis, we add a variable to account for whether a particular condition
   tends to impose a disproportionate burden in high-income, rather than low and middle-income
   countries.
   We examine associations between socioeconomic status and evidence volume, using the Socio-
   Demographic Index (SDI) of the country from the Global Burden of Disease study. As a metric of
   disparity in disease burden, we used the ratio of DALYs occurring in high SDI countries (the top
   fifth) to DALYs occurring in low and medium SDI countries (i.e., the bottom four fifths).
   Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis aiming to discover whether our results are sensitive to
   ‘salami slicing’ (the practice of publishing results from a single trial across multiple publications,
   which could lead us to overestimate the evidence base). We first estimated the mean number of
   publications per RCT for each GBD condition, utilising the subset of articles which contained a
   unique trial registry identifier. Then we use these values to discount our estimate of RCT
   numbers for each GBD condition. We repeated our regression analyses with these discounted
   RCT numbers.
   Results
   We analysed records of 31,367,011 articles indexed in PubMed on July 27th 2020. We estimate that
   459,000 (1.5%) of these articles were reports of RCTs conducted in humans (95% prediction interval
   435,000 to 480,000). We show how these trials are distributed globally (by location of the first author)
   in Figure 1. The number of RCTs published for each of the 22 'level 2' disease categories from the
   2017 Global Burden of Disease study is presented in Table 1 and Figures 2 and 3.
   Mental disorders (ranked 2nd in terms of total DALYs) had the largest number of RCTs with
   50,000, followed by Cardiovascular diseases (ranked 1st) with 49,000. We separate the results
   from trials where the clinical condition occurred in the trial population (generally trials of
   treatment strategies for), and where the condition was a trial outcome (typically trials looking at

   FIGURE 5: Total RCTs published globally from 1990–2017 against disability-adjusted life years in

   In Figure 5 we scatter the volume of evidence estimated for conditions against the global burden that
   they impose (totals in period 1990–2017) for the 22 ‘level 2’ Global Burden of Disease categories.
   Our primary analysis found that, on average, increasing DALYs were associated with a statistically
   significant increase in RCT publication in the same year, but that variance was not well explained by
   the model (β=0.52 for log DALYs, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 0.70; R2=0.13). This translates to an
   average increase in the number of RCTs published of 5% (3.2% to 6.9%) for each 10% increase in
   DALYs in the same year. We report differences between the expected versus observed number of
   RCTs and trial participants based on this model in Table 2.

   We found that models incorporating between 3–5 years of lag had improved fit compared with the
   equivalent model with no lag effects (demonstrated by reduction in Akaike information criterion
   [AIC], Bayesian information criterion [BIC], and increase in adjusted R2). The model incorporating lag
   up to 3 years found an average 7.2% increase in published RCTs for every 10% increase in DALYs
   (adjusted R2=0.29). The models with lag up to 4, and up to 5 years gave near identical estimates and
   fit (full analysis results provided in the statistical appendix).
   We provide full results for our sensitivity analysis (where we adjust for the differential impact of
   RCTs producing multiple publications in each disease in our statistical appendix
   (https://osf.io/zf97n/). We found that RCTs with a registry identifier produced a mean of 1.3
   articles, but that there was variation between GBD categories (from 1.2 articles/RCT in nutritional
   deficiencies to 1.5 articles/RCT in cardiovascular diseases). Compared with our primary results,
   our sensitivity analysis found a near identical relationship between DALYs and published trials
   (β=0.48, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.66; R2=0.13). Adjusting for multiple publications did not affect which
   conditions were found to have relatively high or low associated RCT publications.
   In our final model, which examined the effect of the DALY location (ratio of DALYs in the top fifth of
   countries by socio-demographic index vs. the bottom four fifths), we found that DALYs, and the DALY
   location were both associated with increased RCT publications (βDALY=0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.91,
   βlocation=0.44, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.51; adjusted R2 =0.33). This may be interpreted that for every 10% shift
   in DALYs towards high-income countries, the number of RCTs increased by 4% (3.7 to 4.9), and for
   every 10% increase in DALYs globally, RCTs increased by 7% (5.7 to 9.1).
   Discussion
   We present the results from a natural language processing system that we used to perform a
   large-scale, comprehensive, automated analysis of all published RCTs indexed in the PubMed
   database. We find the number of published RCTs covering health conditions correlates only
   weakly with the burden that they inflict globally. Some conditions (particularly respiratory
   infections and tuberculosis, enteric infections, and transport injuries) attract substantially fewer
   published RCTs than expected based on the global burden.
   Conditions with fewer RCTs and participants than expected tend to disproportionately affect
   countries with low- and medium socio-economic status. For instance, respiratory infections and
   tuberculosis, which had the largest disparity between global burden and number of published

   RCTs disproportionately affects populations in lower income countries.[24] By contrast, cancers
   and diabetes, for which there appears to be a relative abundance of evidence, are comparatively
   common in high-income countries, although this picture is changing over time.[25,26] In other
   words, the top fifth of countries by socio-demographic index, who conduct the vast majority of
   RCTs, are more closely matching RCT conduct with disease burden within their own countries
   (albeit still weakly). These findings suggest that a research funding strategy based on individual
   countries priorities does not optimally meet global needs. However, the picture is complex: global
   development has meant that the most important diseases affecting high-income countries (i.e.
   cardiovascular disease and cancers) have also become the top health priorities in low- and middle-
   income countries a number of years later.
   The median number of participants per RCTs was 72 (i.e., a typical trial is likely to have around
   36 participants per arm, or fewer trials with >2 arms). Smaller trials can be conducted faster and
   at lower cost, and thus can be more responsive to need, but have important limitations.[27] Small
   trials are more susceptible to the effects of publication bias, and have a high likelihood of
   generating false positive, and false negative findings.[28] Meta-epidemiological studies have
   shown that trials with fewer than 100 participants per arm tend to exaggerate treatment effects,
   compared with larger ones.[29,30] Twenty-five years after Yusuf and colleagues called for larger,
   simpler RCTs,[31] unfortunately we find that a majority of published trials are likely to be too
   small to provide useful or definitive information.
   Recently published related work has used machine learning to extract sex data automatically from
   a large set of articles describing RCTs, finding evidence of systematic underrepresentation of
   women in trials.[32]Here, we broaden this approach by applying machine learning to infer the
   conditions and outcomes under study in trials and extracting corresponding sample sizes. By
   using our previously validated model[12] to automatically recognize reports of RCTs, we are able
   to continuously surveil the literature to maintain an up-to-date, comprehensive view of the
   evidence, which we make publicly available to facilitate further research.
   Prior work has investigated the relationship between burden of disease and NIH funding.[8,5]
   These efforts relied on manual compilation of data, which necessarily limited the scope of
   analysis. Additionally, these efforts could only analyze conditions for which funding data was
   available. The authors of the landmark 1999 NEJM study noted that data was not available for
   conditions making up 38% of the total DALY estimate at that time.[5] Conducting this analysis
   manually additionally precludes the realization of a “living” view of the evidence base. By

   contrast, we have developed a fully automated approach that facilitates comprehensive, real-time
   analysis of the published RCT literature. For illustration, at the time of writing (September
   2020), our system has indexed 158 RCTs examining treatments for covid-19. This contrasts with
   PubMed, which has indexed (largely manually) 58 with the equivalent MeSH terms.
   Because our coverage of diseases is broader than prior work on the relationship between funding
   and burden of disease, the results are not directly comparable. However, some findings do
   qualitatively align with findings from prior analyses of research funding. For example, we also
   find that diabetes generated a relatively generous number of RCTs, as do cancers (in general).
   Future analyses using the methods and data could examine specific conditions within the
   categories presented here, investigating, for example, whether stroke is adequately researched
   compared with coronary artery disease, or the distribution of trials relevant to different subtypes
   of cancer.
   Our analysis has some limitations. First, our primary analysis examines publications and not
   RCTs themselves. Our sensitivity analysis confirms previous findings that RCTs may generate
   more than one publication,[33] and so our estimates of publication numbers are likely to be an
   overestimate of the number of trials conducted. However, we found adjusting for estimates of
   duplicate publication made little difference to estimates of research done as a function of global
   burden. Second, the automated data extraction methods used here are only able to count explicit
   mentions of a disease or disorder, and explicit descriptions of participant numbers from the
   abstract, but abstracts do not always contain all the necessary information (in this study, for
   example, 34% of articles publications did not report the number of study participants). There is
   evidence of improvement over time after the publication of the CONSORT recommendations in
   1996.[34]
   Last, we restrict our enquiry to PubMed and therefore have not counted RCTs which have
   produced publications in journals not indexed in PubMed. PubMed tends to under-represent
   articles published in non-English languages (though includes some where an English-language
   translations abstracts exist). PubMed also does not index conference presentations or
   pharmaceutical company data repositories. By focusing on published articles, this analysis will by
   construction miss RCTs whose results are never published (although unpublished trial results
   are arguably not effectively contributing to reducing the global disease burden). Nonetheless,
   PubMed is reasonably comprehensive; and those RCT publications that it misses have been
   found to comprise a relatively small fraction of the available health research.[35,36]

   Why and how do some conditions attract relatively high numbers of RCTs and trial participants?
   Disparities in funding may not be the sole explanation: organisational and cultural differences
   within medical subdisciplines could plausibly play a role. National strategies exist for increasing
   participation in oncology research (e.g., 2008 guidance from the American Society of Clinical
   Oncology which set a target of >10% of patients participating in clinical trials[37]); a large
   proportion of research looking at how best to increase trial recruitment has arisen from cancer
   RCTs.[38] Further investigation of how the better performing medical disciplines achieve their
   high recruitment rates might uncover strategies which are more widely applicable.
   Clinical trials are one small part of tackling the global disease burden and the UN sustainable
   development goals, and this wider landscape needs to be considered when determining research
   priorities. For example, the provision of clean water is likely to be more important for preventing
   enteric infections than any specific health intervention, and probably does not require an RCT to
   prove it.[39] There may be other conditions (e.g., HIV[40]) where established treatments can
   enable those with the condition to have a normal lifespan without significant disability. This
   contrasts with some types of cancer (e.g. pancreatic cancer[41]), where we still lack reliably
   effective treatments. For pharmacological research, the ability to run new trials depends on the
   availability of new candidate drugs to test.[42] Such new candidate drugs depend upon
   unpredictable scientific breakthroughs, which will not neatly tally with global disease burden
   rankings.
   Nonetheless, this data on the relative attention attracted by different health conditions may
   provide a useful metric to consider alongside other indicators of research need. Given that the
   vast majority of trials are being conducted by the wealthiest 20% of countries, targeting national
   health priorities is not sufficient, and a global approach is needed. We publish daily updates of
   the figures in this paper at www.robotreviewer.net/stateoftheevidence, and make the source code
