            Novel technologies are needed to facilitate large-scale detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2
        specific antibodies in human blood samples. Such technologies are essential to support seroprevalence
        studies, vaccine clinical trials, and to monitor quality and duration of immunity. We developed a mi-
        crofluidic nano-immunnoassay for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 1024 samples
        per device. The method achieved a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% based on the analysis
        of 289 human serum samples. To eliminate the need for venipuncture, we developed low-cost, ultra-low
        volume whole blood sampling methods based on two commercial devices and repurposed a blood glu-
        cose test strip. The glucose test strip permits the collection, shipment, and analysis of 0.6 µL whole blood
        easily obtainable from a simple fingerprick. The nano-immunoassay platform achieves high-throughput,
        high sensitivity and specificity, negligible reagent consumption, and a decentralized and simple approach
        to blood sample collection. We expect this technology to be immediately applicable to current and future
        SARS-CoV-2 related serological studies and to protein biomarker diagnostics in general.

Introduction
The emergence of a new coronavirus at the end of 2019, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coron-
avirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), led to an unprecedented global public health crisis [1]. Within ∼10 months, it is
estimated that SARS-CoV-2 infected 35 million people worldwide and 1 million people died of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 [2]. As SARS-CoV-2 causes mainly mild disease or
infection presents without symptoms, many cases are not captured by direct testing in the acute phase of
disease [3]. However, to estimate infection fatality rate and guide public health decisions, it is of utmost
importance to establish the true spread or prevalence of the virus by identifying how many people have been
exposed [4, 5].
     Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using highly sensitive and specific assays can help answer
these questions. Several seroprevalence studies have already been conducted, demonstrating rather low
seroprevalence rates even in areas that were severely affected [6, 7, 8, 9]. Such data show that herd immunity
through natural infection is far from being reached. However, these studies are merely snapshots of an
evolving situation, both in time and space. Therefore, there is a sustained need for seroprevalence studies to
be continuously conducted in order to monitor virus spread and to keep policy makers informed. In addition,
tens to hundreds of thousands of blood samples will need to be tested to determine antibody titers for each
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine phase 3 clinical trial and a large number of samples will need to be tested to monitor
immune responses after a vaccine has been approved and rolled-out. Such studies are cumbersome and
expensive to perform as they require large-numbers of serum samples to be obtained by venipuncture and
analysed by highly sensitive and specific immunological assays to classify samples or to provide quantitative
information on antibody titers.
     Several assays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or chemiluminescent immuno-
assays (CLIA), are commercially available, but mainly rely on serum drawn by venipuncture. These tests
are also rather expensive, with reagent costs on the order of 3-10 USD per test. Alternatively, in-house
ELISAs are difficult to standardize and require high amounts of recombinant antigen, usually around 100ng
per sample [5]. Other recently developed methods such as miniaturized high-throughput ELISAs that use
low microliter volumes suffer from lower sensitivity [10], and ultra-sensitive assays based on digital ELISA
have a low sample throughput of 68 tests per hour [11]. The comparatively high cost of these assays and the
reliance on serum samples taken by venipuncture are considerable hurdles to performing large-scale studies
under normal circumstances, but especially so during a pandemic, when sample collection can put clinical
                                                                  3

staff and study participants at risk. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) can be performed at the point of care or at
home requiring only a ”drop” of whole blood, but the sensitivity and specificity of these assays is often
insufficient [12, 13, 14] and LFAs are relatively expensive at ∼22 USD per test. Furthermore, LFAs provide
test results but no blood samples are being collected which could be used for follow-up analyses.
     There is therefore a clear need for new technologies to supersede existing methods such as ELISA,
CLIA, and LFAs. Novel technologies should be capable of high-throughput, low-reagent consumption, low-
cost per test, high sensitivity and specificity, and be compatible with ultra-low volume whole-blood samples
in the low or even sub-microliter range that can be obtained via a simple fingerprick. Biomarker detection
using dried whole blood on filter paper or other devices would have tremendous advantages as it can be
collected by untrained individuals at home. The samples could then be conveniently shipped by regular
mail at ambient temperature to a central laboratory for analysis and test results returned electronically via a
mobile app or email.
     In this study we developed and validated a nano-immunoassay (NIA) that analyses 1024 samples in
parallel on a single microfluidic device the size of a USB stick. NIA reagent consumption and corresponding
costs are roughly 1000 times less than a standard ELISA. Based on the analysis of 134 negative and 155
positive control sera, NIA achieved a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% when RT-PCR was used
as a reference. NIA performed as well as a standard ELISA for samples obtained more than 20 days post
onset of symptoms, and performed better than ELISA for samples obtained less than 20 days past onset of
symptoms, indicating that NIA is more sensitive than ELISA for the analysis of early timepoint samples
with lower antibody titers. We go on to demonstrate that NIA can be used to measure anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibodies in ultra-low volume dried whole blood samples, eliminating the need for venipuncture blood
collection. We tested two commercial blood collection devices: Neoteryx’s Mitra R and DBS System SA’s
HemaXisTM DB10, and show that it is possible to repurpose low-cost and widely available blood glucose
test strips for sample collection and shipment. Samples could be stored up to 6 days at room temperature
with minimal sample degradation and all three methods yielded better results than an ELISA performed on
standard serum samples collected from the same individuals.

Results
Nano-immunoassay development
We adapted a MITOMI based [15, 16] 1024 NIA device previously applied to vaccine adjuvant screening
[17] and the detection of inflammatory and cancer related protein biomarkers in serum [18] to the detection
of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. The NIA device described here is a simplified version of the original
1024 serum analyzer chip and more similar to the original MITOMI device with slightly enlarged chambers
to accommodate spotted patient samples. The microfluidic device is a standard two-layer polydimethylsilox-
ane (PDMS) device [19], consisting of a flow and a control layer. Fluids in the flow layer can be manipulated
with pneumatic valves formed by the control layer. The device contains 1024 unit cells, each consisting of
an assay and a spotting chamber (Figure 1A). Patient samples are spotted onto an epoxy-coated glass slide
using a contact-printing microarray robot, on top of which the PDMS device is aligned and bonded. Patient
samples are initially isolated by actuating the neck valve and the surface of the assay chamber is patterned
with biotinylated bovine serum albumin (BSA-biotin) and neutrAvidin, leaving a circular surface region
coated with neutrAvidin beneath the MITOMI button. Afterwards, biotinylated anti-His antibody is flowed
through the device, enabling the subsequent immobilization of a His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 antigen. Patient
samples are then solubilized and the sandwich valves are closed, allowing any SARS-CoV-2 specific anti-
bodies to diffuse into the assay chamber and bind the surface immobilized antigen. The MITOMI button
is closed following an incubation period and any unbound material is washed away. A secondary antibody
labeled with phycoerythrin (PE) is flowed to detect the presence of antibodies bound to the SARS-CoV-2
antigen (Fig. 1B, C).
     We optimized the NIA for detection of anti-spike IgG antibodies in human serum by first testing sev-
eral different spike antigen variants and identified the in-house produced trimerized full-length spike protein
as the most suitable antigen (Fig. S1). The use of trimerized full length spike and spike-receptor binding
domain (RBD) both resulted in high signal intensities and low-background. We decided on using the trimer-
ized full-length spike protein as it most closely resembles the natural conformation of the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein. As a proof-of-concept we added chimeric anti-spike antibody at different concentrations into
human serum, spotted each dilution, and showed that NIA could quantify anti-spike antibody concentra-
tions (Fig. 1D, E). Based on this sandwich immunoassay we estimate that our limit of detection (LOD) is
around 1 nM IgG. To permit the analysis of patient sera in a standard, biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) laboratory
we developed a simple treatment protocol that renders the sera BSL-1 compatible. This was achieved by

of 1% [20]. Dried whole blood samples could be safely handled in a BSL-1 environment without requiring
any pre-treatment steps.
Nano-immunoassay validation
We validated the high-throughput NIA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG antibodies with
289 serum samples, collected from 155 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and 134 pre-
pandemic negative samples collected in 2013/14 and 2018. Different serum sample dilutions, ranging from
no dilution to a 1:256 dilution, were spotted to determine the optimal value (Fig. S2). NIA achieved a
maximum specificity and sensitivity of 100% and 98%, respectively, at a serum dilution of 1:8 (Fig. 2A,
S2) and a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve with an area under the curve (AUC) equal to 0.99
(Fig. 2B). In parallel, ELISA was used to validate the presence of anti-spike(S1) IgG in the same patient
samples (Fig. 2C) resulting in a good correlation (R2 =0.87) between NIA and ELISA measurements (Fig.
2D). As the serum samples were obtained from patients at different time points post onset of symptoms
we plotted the NIA results according to when samples were obtained (Fig. 2E). We also analyzed NIA
and ELISA results split into samples obtained on or before 20 days post onset of symptoms (DPOS) and
samples obtained after 20 days post onset when antibody responses are usually fully developed (Fig. 2A, C).
If DPOS was not known for a given patient, then days post diagnosis (DPD) was used instead. Performance
in terms of specificity and sensitivity between NIA and ELISA are similar for samples obtained after 20
days past onset of symptoms, but NIA outperforms ELISA for samples collected on or before 20 days post
onset in terms of sensitivity by 13 percentage points (Fig. 2F).
     Each sample dilution was tested in triplicate, enabling us to test up to 336 different samples or sample
dilutions on a single device. In order to determine if it would be possible to further increase throughput by
reducing the number of replicates we randomly selected one or two of the three 1:8 dilution replicates and
calculated ROC curves, specificity, and sensitivity (Fig. S3). We found that using duplicates only slightly
reduced sensitivity from 98% to 97%, whereas using a single measurement lowered sensitivity to 95%, all
the while retaining a 100% specificity. Given that using duplicate measurements led to only a minimal
change in sensitivity, it will be possible to increase throughput to 512 samples analyzed in duplicate per
device. Additional gains in throughput are theoretically possible by scaling the device itself, with MITOMI
devices containing up to 4160 unit cells having been demonstrated in the past [21].

the positive samples. (H) 1/EC50 categorized according to whether the sample was negative or from an
RT-PCR confirmed positive patient. (I) Anti-IgG-PE signal for a 1:8 dilution of each serum sample versus
1/EC50 .
     To assess device to device reproducibility we tested all serum samples (1:8 dilution) on two separate
devices which resulted in a correlation of R2 = 0.98 (Fig. S4A). We then correlated the measurements from
one of those devices to the measurements made on six other devices and again observed a good correlation of
R2 = 0.95 (Fig. S4B). In the first case the same sample solution was used for spotting two devices, whereas
in the second case the two measurements being compared came from separately prepared patient sample
dilutions. Additionally we compared the anti-IgG-PE signal measured for a reference serum dilution series
on three separate devices and computed an average coefficient of variation equal to 11.7% for the dilutions
measured (Fig. S4C, D).
     To determine quantitative antibody titers in each serum sample, we fit data from the full dilution series to
a saturation binding curve model, enabling us to extract the dilution equivalent to the half-maximum signal
for each serum sample (EC50 ) (Fig. 2G, S5). Using the calculated 1/EC50 value, we again analyzed the NIA
results, resulting in a specificity and sensitivity of 100% and 98%, respectively (2H). Lastly, we compared
the 1/EC50 values to values obtained from a single 1:8 dilution and found an excellent correspondence be-
tween those two measurements (Fig. 2I), indicating that a single measurement returns accurate quantitative
information on antibody concentrations. Only at very high antibody titers does the signal saturate for the
1:8 dilution. Using two measurements of a 1:8 and one slightly higher dilution could therefore maximize

Ultra-low volume whole blood collection and analysis
The NIA platform proved to be highly specific and sensitive when applied to standard serum samples. We
recognized that use of serum samples limits the applicability of our and other methods to samples collected
by venipuncture, which has to be performed by trained personnel in hospitals or point of care settings.
Venipuncture requires large volumes of blood in the 5 mL range, considerable downstream sample process-
ing, and a cold chain from point of sample collection to point of analysis. Large-scale seroprevalence studies
are thus challenging to conduct, especially when including remote or large geographic areas. Establishing a
large-scale, low-cost, and widely accessible serology platform necessitates the development of venipuncture
alternatives. For this reason, we developed a sample collection and processing pipeline that enables us to
carry out NIA with ultra-low volume, dried whole blood samples obtainable by a simple fingerprick. We
tested three different methods to collect, ship, process, extract, and analyze dried whole blood samples (Fig.
3). We tested two commercially available devices that collect 10 µL of whole blood: Neoteryx Mitra R and
DBS System SA HemaXisTM DB10. We also explored the possibility of repurposing existing blood glucose
test strips (Medisana, MediTouch 2) for whole blood collection and shipping. The glucose test strips collect
0.6 µL of whole blood which is approximately twenty times less than what is required by the commercial
devices and 10,000 times less blood than obtained by venipuncture. Furthermore, blood glucose test strips
are cheap at less than 0.5 USD per strip and widely available, potentially avoiding any supply bottlenecks
during a pandemic. The two commercial devices by comparison cost 5-10 USD or 1.25 - 2.5 USD per
sample.
     We evaluated the three collection methods by spiking human whole blood with different concentrations
of anti-spike IgG and collected the blood with each collection device. We then extracted the dried blood
from each device and spotted the samples for NIA analysis. We first tested an aqueous EDTA solution
and sonication for extraction [22], but the use of this buffer resulted in large and inconsistent spots during
microarraying. We then tested PBS (1% BSA) or PBS (1% BSA, 0.5% Tween-20) [23] extraction buffers
with overnight incubation at 4◦ C and found that the addition of 0.5% Tween-20 greatly improved the assay
(data not shown). With this optimized sample extraction workflow we were able to quantitate anti-spike IgG
from the dried blood samples (Fig. 4A-C).
     To assess the variability of each sampling method we collected whole blood spiked with anti-spike IgG
three separate times and compared the on-chip antibody signal (Fig. S6A-C). We calculated the coefficient

of variation for the technical repeats for each anti-spike concentration tested and found that it did not ex-
ceed 15% for any of the three collection methods with an average CV of 5.7%, 7.7%, 9.2% for Mitra R ,
HemaXisTM DB10, and the glucose test strips (Fig. S6D). Although, there may be further variability intro-
duced depending on how each individual collects his or her own blood sample, each device uses a hard-coded
method to collect a specific volume of blood that leads to low variability for NIA antibody detection.
     As we expect these blood sampling devices to be used decentralized, followed by shipping with regular
mail to a central laboratory for analysis, an important factor to assess was sample stability. To determine
stability of anti-spike IgG antibodies we allowed the blood to dry on each device followed by storage for two
and six days at room temperature (23◦ C) before extraction and testing (Fig. 4D-F). Furthermore, depending
on the climatic conditions, samples sent by post may be subject to higher temperatures, therefore we also
stored the devices for 1 day at 55◦ C. For the Mitra R device we observed very little sample degradation
after 6 days of storage at room temperature and slight sample degradation when stored at 55◦ C for one
day. Very similar results were obtained for the glucose test strips. The HemaXisTM DB10 devices were the
most sensitive to prolonged and high temperature storage, but still resulted in sufficient signal for accurate
quantitation.
     Having established that ultra-low volume dried blood samples can be analyzed on the NIA platform,
we tested the method with ultra-low volume whole blood patient samples collected with each of the three
collection methods. As a surrogate for capillary blood we used 36 EDTA-whole blood samples from 21 RT-
PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 15 presumed negative patients hospitalized for other reasons that
served as negative controls. We collected whole blood samples in Geneva followed by shipping via regular
mail to Lausanne for analysis. All positive samples are early seroconverts obtained within 14 days post
diagnosis, and thus even standard, large-volume serum samples are challenging to analyze (Fig. 2C). For
reference measurements we prepared plasma from EDTA-whole blood samples and performed S1 ELISA
assays on the same patient samples.
     We directly compared results obtained by ELISA performed on standard large-volume serum samples
to NIA measurements performed on ultra-low volume dried whole blood samples collected with the three
collection methods and processed as described above (Fig. 5). ELISA detected SARS-CoV-2 specific

negative calls to the intensity of the second highest negative sample. All three methods identified the same

detect antibodies in 33% additional RT-PCR positive samples and the HemaXisTM DB10 and glucose strip
methods were able to detect an additional 29%. This proof of concept study demonstrates that ultra-volume
whole blood samples can be collected and analyzed on the NIA platform. Surprisingly, even difficult to
quantitate samples obtained within the first 14 days post onset of symptoms could be analyzed with this
approach.
Discussion
We developed and validated a high-throughput nano-immunoassay device capable of analyzing 1024 sam-
ples in parallel. Detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG antibodies the method achieved a
specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% based on the analysis of serum samples from 155 positive
SARS-CoV-2 infected and 134 negative individuals, performing as well or better than standard ELISA (Fig.
6A). In addition to generating accurate binary classification of samples, NIA is also capable of returning
accurate antibody titers.
     The method developed here is applicable to the large-scale characterization of serum samples collected
as part of epidemiological studies, identify donors for plasma therapy, and vaccine trial support. A single
researcher can achieve a throughput of 1-2 devices, or 512 - 1024 samples per day (analyzed in duplicate) in
a small research laboratory not dedicated or equipped for high-throughput molecular diagnostics. Due to in-
creases in efficiency, a small team of 3 can likely achieve a throughput of 6 devices or 3’072 samples per day
(analyzed in duplicate). By comparison, the number of RT-PCR tests performed in all of Switzerland ranged
from 6’000 to 18’000 tests per day between April and September 2020. Consumables, reagent consump-
tion, and associated costs are negligible with NIA, which is an important consideration when compared to
the high reagent cost of ELISAs and when considering potential reagent shortages that may be encountered
during critical phases in a global pandemic.
     Platform capabilities could be further expanded in the near term. We previously demonstrated that the
platform can be used to perform multiplexed analysis, allowing 4 or more biomarkers to be tested for each
sample [17, 25, 18]. This would allow the analysis of multiple antigens, cytokines, or inflammatory markers
to provide insights into prior virus exposures and the response to infection. We also previously demonstrated
that kinetic rate measurements can be performed in high-throughput with this method [26] and that digital
ELISAs can be performed using the same technology in instances were lower limits of detection may be
required [27, 11].

     To enable large-scale studies we placed specific emphasis on the development of simple, low-cost, and
ultra-low volume sample collection strategies and integration of these workflows with the nano-immunoassay
platform. We characterized three blood sampling devices and tested all of them with patient samples. Two
of these methods are commercially available devices: Mitra R from Neoteryx and HemaXisTM DB10 from
DBS System SA. We also explored the possibility of repurposing low-cost, and readily available blood glu-
cose test strips for blood sample collection and shipment. The two commercial devices allow the collection
of a minimal volume of 10 µL whereas the blood glucose test strip collects as little as 0.6 µL whole blood.
Such small volumes allow untrained personnel to fingerprick and collect whole blood, eliminating the need
for phlebotomists and the inconvenience of visiting a hospital or point of care location. The collected blood
is allowed to dry on the devices, and we could show that these dried blood samples can be analyzed after 6
days of storage at ambient temperatures eliminating the need for a cold chain.
     The combination of a high-throughput, highly specific and sensitive nano-immunoassay, and the abil-
ity to analyze minute volumes of dried blood samples has enormous potential for SARS-CoV-2 serology,
epidemiological studies, vaccine trial and therapeutic development support. Further areas of use could be
large-scale seroprevalence studies in low- and middle-income countries without sufficient in-country lab-
oratory capacity by sending specimens by international mail. Especially in the current SARS-CoV-2 pan-
demic, population-based seroprevalence studies could elucidate some urgent questions such as the impact
of COVID-19 in Africa [28].
     New technology and method developments such as those reported here will make it possible to over-
come the current centralized molecular diagnostics paradigm, which is focused on hospitals and point of
care settings rather than on patients and individuals seeking simple, affordable, and convenient molecular
diagnostics. The need to visit a clinic is an inconvenience for everyone and can be an insurmountable ob-
stacle for many. The requirement for venipuncture blood collection, sample pre-treatment, and expensive
ELISAs prohibits broad testing and contributes to high health care costs. NIA makes it possible for individ-
uals to purchase a low-cost blood sampling kit containing a lancet, a blood sampling device, and a return
mail envelope, at a local pharmacy or supermarket (Fig. 6B). The kit can be used easily and conveniently in
the privacy of one’s own home, where a simple fingerprick is made and the blood collected by the device.
The device with the collected blood can then be sent without special biosafety requirements by regular mail
to a central laboratory which analyzes the blood sample for one or more biomarkers, interprets the data,
and returns the test results to the individual via smart phone, email, or regular mail. Furthermore, each
blood sample is sufficient to conduct many molecular diagnostic assays with NIA. The whole process from
                                                                  17

kit purchase to results could take less than a week, which is fast enough for a vast majority of tests that
are not particularly time critical.Decentralized and simple sample collection coupled with centralized, next-
generation high-performance molecular tests will broaden access to molecular diagnostics, and increase the
use of testing. During a global pandemic, such technologies could enable the collection of critical epidemi-
ological data, provide instrumental data for vaccine development, and provide information to individuals on
their health status.

Materials and methods
Microfluidic chip fabrication
The designs for the flow and control layer of the device were drawn with AutoCAD software, we then used
standard photolithography to fabricate the molds for each layer. Three replicates of the design are fitted
onto a 4 inch silicon wafer so that three devices can be made in a single fabrication process. SU-8 negative
photoresist was used to create the control channel features (GM 1070, Gersteltec Sarl) with a height of 30
µm, while AZ 10XT-60 positive photoresist (Microchemicals GmbH) was used to generate flow channel
features with a height of 15 µm. After development, the flow layer mold was annealed at 180◦ C in a
convection oven for two hours to obtain rounded features. Afterwards each of the wafers was treated with
TMCS (trimethylchlorosilane) and coated with PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning). For the control layer
∼50 g of PDMS with an elastomer to crosslinker ratio of 5:1 was prepared, whereas for the flow layer a
20:1 ratio of elastomer to crosslinker was spin coated at 1800 rpm to yield a height of ∼50 µm. Both PDMS
coated wafers were then partially cured for 20 minutes at 80◦ C, after which devices from the control layer
were cut out and the inlets for each control line were punched (OD = 889 mm) using a precision manual-
punching machine (Syneo, USA). Each control layer is then aligned onto the flow layer by hand using a
Nikon stereo microscope. The aligned devices were then placed at 80◦ C for 90 minutes, allowing the two
layers to bond together so that the entire device can then be cut and removed from the flow wafer. After that,
the flow layer inlets were punched.
Immunoassay reagents
For our on-chip immunoassay we used biotinylated mouse anti-His antibodies (Qiagen, 34440) to immo-
bilize His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 antigens on the surface of our assay chambers. Following expression in
HEK293 cells, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was purified at the EPFL Protein Core Facility. For proof-
of-concept experiments, chimeric anti-spike antibodies were purchased from Sino Biological (40150-D002,
40150-D003, 40150-D004, 40150-D005). We spiked the chimeric anti-spike antibodies into human serum
(Sigma-Aldrich, H4522) and whole blood (ZenBio, SER-WB). For detecting human IgG, we used PE la-
beled goat anti-Human-IgG (Abcam, ab131612).

Sample preparation
Serum
Serum samples were collected from 155 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 134 negative control
sera obtained in 2013/14 and 2018 before the start of the pandemic (including 50 children). All samples were
collected according to the local ethical guidelines and ethical approval was waived by the ethics committee of
the University Hospital of Geneva (HUG). We used days post onset of symptoms (dpos) according to patient
history or days post diagnosis (dpd) in case dpos was unknown. All samples were stored at -20◦ C until
analysis. In order to handle patient serum samples in a Biosafety Level 1 laboratory, patient serum samples
were heat treated at 56◦ C for 30 minutes and Triton X-100 (Fisher Scientific) was added to the samples to a
final concentration of 1%. In order to optimize spotting parameters and the on-chip immunoassay, proof-of-
concept experiments involving human serum spiked with chimeric anti-spike antibodies were also carried
out with the addition of Triton X-100. For dilution series experiments, patient serum samples were diluted
in a PBS solution containing 2% BSA. Additionally, 10 µM FITC-dextran (10 kDa) was added as a tracer
to each sample in order to assess whether similar volumes of serum samples were spotted (Fig. S7).
Whole and dried blood
Human Whole Blood - Frozen, 10ml was obtained from AMS Biotechnology (Europe). Anti-spike anti-
bodies were added to whole blood to the desired concentration from a stock solution of 2 µM. To simulate
a fingerprick collection, 15-20 µL of whole blood samples were pipetted on parafilm and then collected
on the sampling device where 10 µL were collected with HemaXisTM DB10 (DBS System SA) or Mitra R
Clamshell (Neoteryx). The samples were dried and then stored in their original container without further
protection. Samples were kept at room temperature for 1, 2 or 6 days, or in a 55◦ C oven for 1 day. The dried
blood stored on HemaXisTM filter paper were cut using an 8 mm biopsy puncher and scalpel and the tip
of the Mitra R devices were removed with tweezers. The samples were placed in a 96-well plate and filled
with 200 µL of cold extraction buffer (1xPBS, 1% BSA, 0,5% Tween20) [1] and incubated overnight at 4◦ C
with 300 rpm agitation. Around 150 µL per well of the supernatant was recovered and stored at -20◦ C until
analysis. Alternatively, a small volume of blood (around 0.6 µL) was collected with a Meditouch 2 glucose
test strip (Medisana), dried and stored in a box kept at room temperature for 1,2 or 6 days, or in a 55◦ C oven
for 1 day. Extraction was performed by placing the strip at the bottom of a 1,5 mL tube filled with 30 µL of
extraction buffer overnight at 4◦ C.

     As a substitute for capillary blood taken from a fingerprick, we used leftover EDTA whole blood sam-
ples drawn from hospitalised COVID-19 patients at different time points post diagnosis for routine clinical
laboratory analysis. EDTA whole blood samples were stored at 4◦ C for a maximum of seven days before
they were applied to the dried blood collection devices. 20 µL of EDTA whole blood was pipetted on a
parafilm sheet, and collected with a Mitra R device or glucose strip. For the HemaXisTM device, 10 µL of
whole blood was directly pipetted on the filter card. The samples were dried for 30 minutes and placed in
a plastic bag with silica gel before shipping. The samples were extracted as described above 5 days after
collection and shipping, microarray spotted on a glass slide on day 6 and the nano-immunoassay chip was
run on day 7. To determine antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein by Euroimmun S1 ELISA, EDTA
whole blood samples where centrifuged for 5min at 1200x g at 4◦ C and 200 µL of plasma were stored at
4◦ C until analysis.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Euroimmun S1 IgG ELISA (Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany, # EI 2606-9601 G) was performed ac-
cording to the manufacturers instructions and was run on a Dynex Agility (RUWAG Handels AG, Bettlach,
Switzerland). OD ratios were calculated by dividing the OD450 of each sample by the OD450 of a calibrator
that was run on each plate. Results equal or above OD ratio of 1.1 were considered positive.
Microarray spotting
25 µL of each sample were loaded into a 384 microwell plate (ArrayIt, MMP384). An MP3 microarray
printing pin (Arrayit) was used to spot the samples onto an epoxy-coated glass slide using a QArray2 mi-
croarrayer (Genetix). The presence of Triton X-100 in the serum samples had a significant effect on the spot
diameter. To account for this we increased the dimensions of the spotting chamber and set the inking and
stamping time to 50 ms and 1 ms, respectively. In addition, it was critical that the ambient humidity was
below ∼42%, otherwise the spots would become too large and merge together. After spotting, the PDMS
chip was aligned on top of the sample spots using a stereo microscope and bonded over night at 40 ◦ C.
Running on-chip immunoassays
Control lines were filled with PBS, attached to the chip and pressurized at 145 kPa. While isolating the
spotted sample with the neck valve closed, the lower half of the unit cells were patterned with BSA-biotin
                                                                  25

(Thermo Fisher, 29130) and neutrAvidin (Thermo Fisher, 3100). First BSA-biotin was flowed at a con-
centration of 2 mg/mL for 20 minutes, then neutrAvidin was flowed at a concentration of 1 mg/mL for 20
minutes. A flow pressure of 27-34 kPa was maintained for each of the flow steps. Afterwards the button
valve was actuated and BSA-biotin was flowed for an additional 20 minutes. In between each of these steps
a solution of 0.005% Tween 20 (Sigma, P1379) in PBS was flowed for 5 minutes to wash away any unbound
material. After surface functionalization, a 1 µg/mL solution of biotinylated anti-His antibody in 2% BSA in
PBS was flowed for 20 minutes. Next a 6.7 µg/mL solution of His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in 2%
BSA in PBS was flowed for 20 minutes. The spike protein solution contained 25% chicken serum (Sigma,
C5405), which served to block the surface and reduce non-specific binding. Before each of these steps the
solution was first flowed for 2 minutes with the button valves down, allowing the solution to flow evenly
into the entire device. After flowing each solution for 20 minutes, a wash step was performed by flowing
0.005% Tween PBS for 5 minutes with the button valves down. Once the spike protein was attached to the
surface, the serum spots were re-solubilized by opening the neck valve and allowing 0.005% Tween PBS
to flow into the spotting chamber while the outlet valve was closed. The neck valve was then closed and
0.005% Tween PBS was flowed for 5 minutes to prevent cross-contamination of samples in neighboring unit
cells. The sandwich valves were then closed and the neck valve was released to allow any antibodies present
in the serum spot to diffuse into the assay chamber. After an incubation of 70 minutes the button valve
was opened and a second incubation of 60 minutes was carried out, permitting any anti-spike antibodies
to bind to the spike protein. Any unbound material could then be washed away by flowing 0.005% Tween
PBS for 5 minutes with the button and neck valves closed. A 5.6 µg/mL solution of anti-IgG-PE was then
flowed for 2 minutes with the buttons down, then for 10 minutes with the buttons up. The buttons were then
closed and any unbound detection antibody was washed away by flowing 0.005% Tween PBS for 5 minutes.
Each unit cell was then imaged with an exposure time of 300 ms using a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti microscope
equipped with a LED Fluorescent Excitation System, a Cy3 filter set, and a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0
camera (C11440).
Data analysis
The detection antibody signal was quantified using a custom Python script. ROC analysis was performed
using GraphPad Prism. Cutoff values for the NIA measurements were chosen by maximizing both the
specificity and sensitivity values. EC50 values were determined by fitting the dilution series data (1:256 -
1:8) for each sample to a saturation binding curve, y =                Bmax x
                                                                     x+EC50 . For all samples Bmax was set to 65000.
