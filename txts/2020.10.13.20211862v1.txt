  58      Abstract
  59      Sustained viral response (SVR) rates to first-line Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) therapy for
  60      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection routinely exceed 95%. However, a small number of patients
  61      require retreatment. Sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) is a potent DAA
  62      combination primarily used for the retreatment of patients failed by first line DAA therapies.
  63      Here we evaluate retreatment outcomes and the effects of resistance associated
  64      substitutions (RAS) in a real-world cohort, including the largest number of genotype (GT)3
  65      infected patients, to date. 144 patients from the UK were retreated with SOF/VEL/VOX
  66      following virologic failure with first-line DAA treatment regimens. Full-length HCV genome,
  67      next-generation sequencing was performed prior to retreatment with SOF/VEL/VOX. HCV
  68      subtypes were assigned and RAS relevant to each genotype were identified (15% read cut-
  69      off). GT1a and GT3a were the two most common subtypes in the cohort, each making up
  70      38% (GT1a n=55, GT3a n=54) of the cohort. 40% (n=58) of patients had liver cirrhosis of
  71      whom 7% (n=4) were decompensated, 10% (n=14) had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and
  72      8% (n=12) had received a liver transplant prior to retreatment. The overall re-treatment
  73      SVR12 rate was 90% (129/144). On univariate analysis, GT3 infection (50/62; SVR=81%,
  74      p=0.009), cirrhosis (47/58; SVR=81% , p=0.01) and prior treatment with SOF/VEL(12/17;
  75      SVR=71%, p=0.02) or SOF + DCV (14/19; SVR=74%, p=0.012) were all significantly associated
  76      with retreatment failure, but existence of pre retreatment RAS was not when the genotype
  77      of the virus is taken into account. The lower SVR rates achieved in patients retreated with
  78      SOF/VEL/VOX for patients with GT3 infection, cirrhosis and prior treatment with SOF/VEL or
  79      SOF/DCV has important implications for both patients and HCV elimination strategies.

  81      Introduction
  82      Sustained Virological Response (SVR) rates for patients chronically infected with hepatitis C
  83      virus (HCV) and treated with Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) therapies in clinical trials and real-
  84      world cohorts are often >95% (1–3). Treatment failure is associated with multiple host and
  85      viral factors including advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and the presence of resistance
  86      associated substitutions (RAS) in HCV-encoded proteins that are targeted by DAA (4). HCV
  87      subtype is also known to have an effect on treatment outcomes; GT4r, GT3b and GT1l have
  88      each shown reduced susceptibility to NS5A inhibitor-containing regimens such as sofosbuvir
  89      and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) or sofosbuvir and velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) (5–7). This means there is
  90      a small percentage of HCV-infected patients who have been failed by first-line therapies and
  91      are therefore by definition “difficult to treat”. Additionally, retreatment of this “difficult to
  92      treat” patient population may be made more challenging, as treatment failure commonly is
  93      associated with the emergence of RAS, which in the case of RAS to the NS5A inhibitor class
  94      of DAAs can persist for years after treatment failure (8). For patients who have been failed
  95      by pan-genotypic regimens such as SOF/VEL and glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, (GLE/PIB)
  96      retreatment options are limited. Currently the European Association for the Study of the

  98      recommend a combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) for
  99      these patients(9,10). However GLE/PIB + SOF is effective in small clinical trials(11) and both
 100      AASLD and EASL consider it a valid alternative if patients have failed multiple rounds of

 105      POLARIS-4 phase-II and III studies (12), with SVR rates in excess of 95%. In these trials most
 106      patients retreated with SOF/VEL/VOX (228/445; 51%) and (132/445; 29%) were infected
 107      with HCV GT1 and GT3 respectively, 46% of the patients had cirrhosis and 49-83% had
 108      detectable RAS before retreatment. Nevertheless, SOF/VEL/VOX showed a very high SVR
 109      rate in GT1 infected patients (222/228; 97% SVR); however, a slightly higher virologic failure
 110      rate in GT3 patients was observed (126/132; 95% SVR). A number of studies have evaluated
 111      the observed real-world outcomes of SOF/VEL/VOX retreatment, in both the US and Europe.
 112      The largest cohort (n=573) from the US, reported by Belperio, et al (13), showed lower SVR
 113      rates than in the POLARIS 1 and 4 studies for all genotypes (GT1: 429/473; 91% SVR, GT2:
 114      18/20; 90% SVR, GT3: 42/46; 91% SVR, GT4: 12/12; 100% SVR). This study also showed that
 115      the SVR rate for those who had received SOF/VEL as a first-line therapy, was reduced for
 116      GTs 1-3 (GT1: 15/19; 79% SVR, GT2: 13/15; 87% SVR, GT3: 11/13; 85% SVR). In an Italian
 117      cohort (14), the SVR rate was 95% (162/169) with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma
 118      (HCC) being associated with treatment failure, however there was no significant difference
 119      between the SVR rates of patients with different genotypes (GT1: 98/101; 97% SVR, GT2:
 120      17/17; 100% SVR, GT3: 33/36; 91% SVR, GT4: 14/15; 93% SVR). Finally, Llaneras, et al (15)
 121      reported an overall SVR rate of 95% (128/135) with 100% in patients with GT1 (82/82) and
 122      GT2 (7/7) infection, 80% (24/30) in GT3 and 93% (13/14) in GT4. SVR rates were significantly
 123      lower in patients with cirrhosis (89%, p = 0.05), or those with GT3 infection (80%, p <0.001),
 124      whilst patients with GT3 infection and cirrhosis had the lowest SVR rate (69%).
 125
 126      Despite these studies there remains limited data from the real-world setting, particularly in
 127      patients with GT3 infection and on the prevalence of post-treatment RAS amongst patients
 128      not achieving SVR with first line DAA treatment and the potential impact of these RAS on

 129      SOF/VEL/VOX retreatment outcomes. Data following unsuccessful therapy with pan-
 130      genotypic DAA regimens such as SOF/VEL or GLE/PIB retreated with SOF/VEL/VOX is
 131      particularly lacking and these data are urgently required to inform optimal retreatment
 132      strategies. In this paper we report the outcomes of 144 patients failed by first line DAA
 133      therapy and retreated with SOF/VEL/VOX. We then analyse the effect of clinical
 134      characteristics and RAS on SOF/VEL/VOX retreatment.
 135      Results
 136      Baseline characteristics of patients
 137      Outcomes were available for 144 patients who were retreated with SOF/VEL/VOX. The
 138      mean age was 56 years (49-63 IQR) with 84% (n=121) of the cohort being male. Overall, 40%
 139      (n=58) had cirrhosis, with 7% (n=4) decompensated. 10% (n=14) had HCC and 8% (n=12) had
 140      received a liver transplant prior to retreatment (Table 1). GT1a and GT3a were the two most
 141      common subtypes, each making up 38% (GT1a n=55, GT3a n=54) of the cohort, 17 other
 142      subtypes were identified from genotypes 1,2,3,4 and 6, with GT1b, GT4r and GT3b making
 143      up 6% (n=9),4% (n=6), and 3% (n=5) of the cohort respectively (Figure 1).
 144
 145      Effectiveness of retreatment with SOF/VEL/VOX
 146      The overall SVR12 rate for patients retreated with SOF/VEL/VOX was 91% (Figure 2).
 147      The majority of patients who did not achieve an SVR (n=15) experienced a post
 148      treatment relapse (n=10). One patient experienced an on-treatment breakthrough
 149      (patient’s HCV RNA is undetectable during treatment and then becomes detectable
 150      again during treatment.) and two were non-responders (patients who never achieve

 151      undetectable HCV RNA). Relapse/breakthrough/non-response was not reported by the
 152      treating clinician for the remaining two patients.
 153      Evaluating the factors associated with outcome using univariable logistic regression,
 154      GT3 infection (52/64; SVR=81%, p=0.009) and cirrhosis (47/58; SVR=81%, p=0.01) were
 155      both significantly associated with treatment outcome (Figure 3). Patients whose initial
 156      regimen was either SOF/VEL or SOF + DAC were also less likely to achieve SVR on
 157      retreatment (12/17, 71% =0.02 and 14/19, 74%, p=0.012 respectively). Patients with
 158      GT3 infection, cirrhosis and prior treatment with SOF/VEL had the lowest SVR rate of
 159      42% (3/7). However, one of these patients only received 4 weeks of SOF/VEL/VOX
 160      (Supplementary Table 2). Multivariable analysis using logistic regression with SVR as
 161      the response variable and GT, presence/absence of cirrhosis and previous treatment
 162      regimen included as explanatory variables, revealed that prior treatment with SOF/VEL
 163      had the largest effect on SVR and remained the only variable significantly associated
 164      with outcome (p=0.03) (Supplementary Figure 1). However, with the exception of one
 165      GT1 patient previously treated with SOF/VEL, all patients with prior SOF/VEL or SOF +
 166      DCV treatment had GT3 infection which confounded this result (Table 1). When GT3-
 167      infected patients were analysed separately, cirrhosis and prior treatment regimen
 168      were no longer significantly associated with outcome, in both the univariable and
 169      multivariable analysis.
 170      Effect of resistance-associated substitutions on retreatment outcome
 171      Among the 144 patients retreated with SOF/VEL/VOX and with available outcomes, 70%
 172      (101/144) had detectable RAS prior to retreatment. 16% had NS3 inhibitor RAS, 51% NS5A

 173      inhibitor RAS and 34% SOF RAS. Of the viral sequences in 15 patients failed by SOF/VEL/VOX
 174      retreatment, 12/15 (80%) had detectable RAS prior to retreatment compared to 89/129
 175      (68%) in those subsequently achieving SVR. However, despite the high prevalence of RAS,
 176      the presence of a RAS in a particular protein or combination of proteins was not significantly
 177      associated with outcome (Table 2). When each RAS was considered independently using
 178      logistic regression, A30K and Y93H RAS in NS5A were associated with retreatment failure in
 179      the whole cohort (A30K p=0.02, Y93H p=0.01) (Table 3). The A30K RAS is unique to GT3a (it
 180      is wild-type in GT3b) and the Y93H substitution was much more common in GT3 patients
 181      compared to other genotypes (Supplementary Figure 2). When the analysis is limited to GT3
 182      patients, the SVR rates for patients with these RAS were still reduced (for A30K SVR, 71%
 183      and Y93H SVR, 78%) but this was no longer statistically significant (A30K p=0.2, Y93H p=0.3).
 184      In addition, when genotype is added as a cofactor to the logistic regression Y93H is no
 185      longer associated with outcome. Whilst individually the A30K and Y93H RAS are common,
 186      the combination of A30K + Y93H is found rarely and is not associated with treatment
 187      outcome in this cohort (Supplementary Figure 3). No other RAS was significantly associated
 188      with outcome within the whole cohort or within a specific genotype of patients.
 189
 190      Discussion
 191      This cohort represents both the largest reported cohort of patients retreated with
 192      SOF/VEL/VOX in the UK, and the largest cohort of GT3-infected patients retreated with
 193      SOF/VEL/VOX. Our results show that retreatment of patients with SOF/VEL/VOX who
 194      have been failed by first-line therapy is very effective for GT1. However, patients with
 195      GT3 infection, cirrhosis or prior treatment with SOF/VEL or SOF/DCV have significantly
 196      lower SVR rates with SOF/VEL/VOX retreatment.

 197      Our data shows that GT3-infected patients achieved lower SVR rates to SOF/VEL/VOX
 198      retreatment; the lowest SVR12 rates (42%) were observed in patients with GT3
 199      infection, cirrhosis and prior SOF/VEL exposure. This is consistent with the data from
 200      Llaneras et al (15), which also showed a SVR rate of 81% for GT3-infected patients and
 201      69% for GT3-infected patients with cirrhosis. Belperio, et al (13) have shown that GT1-
 202      infected patients with prior SOF/VEL exposure had a reduced SVR rate of 79% (15/19),
 203      yet a GT3-infected group with prior SOF/VEL exposure had a SVR rate of 85% (11/13)
 204      which is greater than the 75%(12/16) that was observed in the GT3-infected patients in
 205      our study but, these numbers remain small.
 206      The overall prevalence of RAS was very high in this cohort and the presence of the
 207      NS5A inhibitor RAS Y93H was significantly associated with treatment failure across the
 208      whole cohort. However, when genotype is included in the model used to test
 209      association, Y93H is no longer significantly associated with outcome. This data suggests
 210      that viral genotype is the more important viral factor for SOF/VEL/VOX retreatment
 211      outcome than the presence of RAS. However, PIB has been shown to be more effective
 212      than other NS5A inhibitors against viruses harbouring the Y93H RAS in-vitro (16). This
 213      could mean that GLE/PIB would be more effective against virus strains harbouring the
 214      Y93H RAS. Thus, RAS testing to guide retreatment therapy could be an effective way to
 215      increase retreatment SVR rates.
 216      At present SOF/VEL/VOX is the only recommended retreatment regimen for patients
 217      previously failed by a NS5A inhibitor containing regimen in England. These data suggest
 218      that whilst SOF/VEL/VOX may be a preferred regimen for non-GT3 infected patients, an

 219      alternative retreatment regimen for GT3-infected patients should also be considered,
 220      particularly those with cirrhosis and previous exposure to a DAA regimen containing
 221      VEL or DCV. One current alternative to SOF/VEL/VOX for these patients is the off-label
 222      use of GLE/PIB + SOF +/-RBV. This combination was effective in a small retreatment
 223      trial (11) and could represent an effective retreatment option for GT3 patients with
 224      prior exposure to SOF/VEL. Further options include adopting a resistance guided
 225      approach to treatment, increasing the SOF/VEL/VOX treatment duration or adding
 226      ribavirin.
 227      In summary, our study shows that retreatment outcomes for patients failed by first-
 228      line DAA therapy is very successful for non-GT3-infected patients. However, for GT3-
 229      infected patients, particularly those with cirrhosis and failed by initial SOF/VEL
 230      treatment, SVR rates were significantly lower and alternative retreatment regimens
 231      such as GLE/PIB + SOF should be considered.
 232      Methods
 233      Patients and Samples
 234      This study included 215 individuals from across England, United Kingdom who did not
 235      achieve a SVR with previous interferon-free DAA treatment. Blood samples were taken prior
 236      to retreatment and samples sent to Oxford and Glasgow for HCV whole genome sequencing
 237      (WGS). Clinical, demographic and treatment outcome data were collected from patients,
 238      who were enrolled in HCV Research UK (n=37), following informed consent and ethical
 239      approval (17). For patients not enrolled in HCV Research UK, whole genome HCV sequences

 240      and anonymised clinical data were provided by Public Health England (PHE), collected as
 241      part of the Virus Reference Department’s 's HCV antiviral resistance testing service. This
 242      provides a clinical service for National Health Service Trusts, which send patients’ blood
 243      samples for HCV genotyping and resistance testing by WGS and receive results in real time
 244      to inform clinical management. Approval for the use of data from this service was granted
 245      under Regulation 3 of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002.
 246      For retreatment, SVR was defined a minimum of 12 weeks after the end of treatment.
 247
 248      Whole Genome Sequencing of HCV
 249      Whole HCV genome sequencing was conducted at three sites to define HCV subtype and
 250      identify RAS: (i) The MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), (ii) The
 251      Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, University of Oxford, and (iii) The Virus
 252      Reference Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England. These sites have
 253      previously collaborated to ensure uniform standards for HCV sequencing (18). Briefly, RNA
 254      was isolated from patient plasma samples and reverse transcribed to produce cDNA. An
 255      Illumina sequencing library was generated and enriched for HCV viral sequences using
 256      specific oligonucleotide probes. Illumina sequencing reads were then processed and
 257      mapped to the closest HCV reference genome. Precise details of how the sequencing was
 258      performed at each site is described in the supplementary materials.
 259
 260      Resistance Associated Substitution Calling using HCV-GLUE
 261      HCV subtypes were assigned and NS3, NS5A and NS5B RAS relevant to each genotype were
 262      identified (15% of reads cut off) using HCV-GLUE and RAS definitions provided by PHE (19)
 263      (Supplementary Table 3). HCV-GLUE is a resource created as part of the STOP-HCV

 264      consortium based on the GLUE (Genes Linked by Underlying Evolution) platform (20). HCV-
 265      GLUE uses the ICCT HCV reference sequences and collates publicly available HCV sequences,
 266      to construct phylogenies using RAxML to assign sequences to HCV clades. It also contains a
 267      database of HCV RAS created by PHE (19) and this is used to identify RAS relevant to the
 268      HCV genotype and subtype (21).
 269
 270      Statistical Analysis
 271      All statistical analysis was performed using custom code and R version 3.6.2. Logistic
 272      regression was used for analysis of association between categorical variables.
