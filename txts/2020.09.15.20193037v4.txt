    Summary:
    Background: Tubularized incised plate (TIP) urethroplasty as the most common hypospadias
    repair method, aims to achieve normal functioning of the penis along with cosmetic
    reconstruction. However, there are remaining questions toward anatomical prognostic factors
    affecting the results of surgery. Lack of age-matched controls or controlling for meatal location,
    employment of several surgical techniques or multiple surgeons, or age heterogeneity of the
    study population are the problems affected the results of the current body of literature.
    Objective: This prospective study aimed to evaluate the preoperative factors to predict future
    complications associated with hypospadias repair outcomes in males aged between 1-3 years and
    performed by a single surgeon with employing multivariable analysis.
    Patients and methods: A prospective cohort of 101 males aging from 1 to 3 years with distal to
    mid-shaft hypospadias were consecutively selected for TIP repair. The urethral plate dimensions
    in erect and flaccid states, penile length, glans diameter, and chordee were evaluated individually
    before reconstruction. After surgery and during follow-up visits, the subsequent transient and
    persistent complications were recorded.
    Results: Postoperatively, the acute transient events were observed in 42 cases (41.6%) and the
    persistent complications in 16 cases (15.8%). The uncomplicated group had a higher percentage
    of patients with distal meatal location than the complicated group (P=0.01%). Furthermore,
    fistula formation was notably higher in the group with acute surgical site infection (P<0.001).
     wedThe analysis also sho             the width of the urethral plate to be associated with the development of
    complications (P=0.03).
    Conclusion: By performing TIP by a single surgeon on a homogenous study population and
    eliminating the impact of severe chordee as a potential cofounding variable, this study
                                                                        2

    prospectively found that out of the anatomical specifications, pre- and postoperative factors, the
    urethral meatus location was the only significant and independent predictor of the development
    of complications in young children with midshaft to distal hypospadias. Moreover we found that
    in young children the wider the plate was, the more complications happened. Consequently, we
    hypostatized that in young children who their anatomical dimensions are almost in same range of
    values, a combination of urethral width and depth should be considered in the investigation of
    prognostic factors for hypospadias repair outcomes. (figure 1)

    INTRODUCTION
   As a common congenital anomaly, hypospadias typically requires surgical repair during the early
   years of life. Hypospadias is a consequence of defective closure of the urethral fold and is
   characterized by deficient ventral preputial skin, a more proximally located meatus which can be
   accompanied by the chordee. Despite, the fact that numerous procedures have been described,
   today, the most common repair method for distal hypospadias is the TIP (Tubularized Incised
   Plate) urethroplasty [1].
   Fistula, meatal/urethral stenosis, and dehiscence are amongst the most common complications
   following primary repair of hypospadias [2, 3]. A central question has been the preoperative or
   intraoperative factors that can predict future complications. Identifying these parameters would
   allow risk assessment and potentially lead to new techniques to circumvent these adverse
   features.
   Wide discrepancy exists in the literature regarding prognostic factors related to the urethral plate
   and other penile dimensions. For example glans and urethral plate width have been correlated
   with postsurgical complications. However useful prognostic factors in the management of
   hypospadias remain poorly defined [1, 3-8]. Factors complicating prior studies include, non-
   homogenous patient populations, variations between multiple surgeons, lengthy accrual times
   during which subtle technique changes may have occurred. In this study, we assess several
   possible prognostic factors for complications in a rigorous, homogenous series of de-novo
   hypospadias cases, 1-3 years in age.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   In this study, 101 children with hypospadias were evaluated in a prospective cohort study
   concerning the characteristics of their urethral plate dimensions in erect and flaccid states, penile
   stretched length, glans characteristics, and chordee. Subsequent, acute events and postoperative
   complications during the follow-up period were carefully monitored and recorded by collecting
   the data with the help of a survey form (Supplemental file).
   The study received the institutional review board approval (IRB No. 92/3-1/4) and was
   conducted at the urology clinic of a referral hospital within 12 months.
   The inclusion criteria were the first time surgery cases of distal to mid-shaft hypospadias with an
   age between 1 to 3 years old.
   The exclusion criteria were the co-existence of moderate to severe chordee, micro-penis, or a
   prior history of hypospadias surgery or circumcision. Micropenis was defined as a dorsal length
   of a stretched penis less than 1.9 cm in length for a term infant or if the length is less than 2.5
   standard deviation below the mean. Chordee or ventral curvature (VC) was recorded at the first
   visit and also after performing the erection test before making skin incisions. Chordee is defined
   as a penile shaft curvature and is categorized based on its degree: mild (<30), moderate (30–45),
   and severe (>45) curvature [9].
   Procedure:
                                                                        4

   After the induction of anesthesia in the operation room, the diameter of glans, the length and
   width of the urethral plate, and the presence of ventral curvature were determined in both flaccid
   and erect states. Chordee was corrected by degloving and extensive ventral dissection if needed.
   All patients underwent TIP repair. The urethral plate was tubularized over 8 Fr Nelaton stent
   with a three-layer reconstruction. A ventral dartos flap was mobilized for additional coverage
   and secured on each side as the flap the 3rd layer using 5-0 Vicryle interrupted stitches. The skin
   was closed by subcuticular continuous 6-0 Vicryl stitches. Two-layer closure of the glans wings
   was carried out for glanuloplasty. Additional coverage of the glandular urethra was provided by
   using a separate dartos flap for glanular urethral protection. We didn’t insist on the construction
   of a total glanular conical shape, to prevent the stricture of neomeatus, rather, we built the
   neomeatus approximately 3 millimeters below the normal location. As a final step, we replace 8
   Fr stent with similar 6 Fr one. After the surgery, the patients were dressed, using Vaseline gauze
   and ordinary sterilized gauze. For about 2 to 4 days, they received IV cefazolin. The stent
   removed on between 5th to 7th day postoperatively. All surgeries were done by a single high
   volume attending pediatric urologist. In no cases was preoperative testosterone used. In the
   postoperative phase, emerging complications were divided into categories: transient acute events
   and persistent complications. Patients were revisited after 1 and 6 months. At the second follow-
   up visit at least one of the parents assessed satisfaction completing a survey list in terms of
   cosmetic outcomes (based on parents overall perception regarding meatal location and shape, and
   general cosmetic appearance) and functional outcomes (voiding without splitting, spraying or
   straining and away from the feet) with yes or no questions comparing their perception before and
   after repair.
   STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
    The Data obtained is presented as standard deviation (±mean) and average (%). Data
    analysis was performed in SPSS version 24.0. The T-test was employed for independent
    groups to compare quantitative variables.
   Ki2 or Fisher test was applied to compare qualitative data. Furthermore, A regression logistic
   model was deployed for multivariable data analysis and determining independent parameters. P
   values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
   Results
    One hundred and one patients were included. The mean age of the patients undergoing surgery
    was 19.86 ±8.60 (12-36) months. The location of urethral meatus was distal in 88 patients
    (87.1%) and mid-shaft in 13 patients (12.9%) (diagram 1). The mean dorsal length of the
    stretched penis was 22.99±4.03 millimeters (mm) (range: 15-32 mm). The median length of the
    penis at the ventral surface was 19.04 ±3.81 mm (range: 10-29 mm). Thirty-one patients had
    minor ventral curvature (30.7%). The glans urethral plate was categorized according to the
    depth of the urethral groove in the flaccid state and included a glans group with complete cleft
    with 45 (44.6%) cases, incomplete cleft, 53 cases (52.5%), and a flat group with 3 cases (3%)
    (Figure 1).

   The mean width of the urethral plate was 9.51± 2.50 (4-20) mm in flaccid condition and
   10.59±2.62 (5-21) mm in the erect state. Accordingly, the width of the urethral plate was less
   than 1 cm in 46 cases (45.5%) and 1 cm or more in 55 cases (54.5%). The mean length of UP
   was 10.52±2.88 (6-18) mm when erect and 11.86±2.41 (8-22) mm when flaccid. The mean
   diameter of glans was 17.18±3.08 (12-23) mm (when flaccid ).
    POST-OPERATIVE FINDINGS
   The mean length of the reconstructed urethral plate was 12.42±2.51 (8.20) mm. Acute
   postoperative events were observed in 42 cases (41.6%). The mean time to the development of
   acute events was 2.67±1.16 (1-5) days. Acute events (complications) are different from persistent
   complications in that they are transient. The mean total follow-up time was 6.58±3.36 (1-12)
   months. 85 (84.2%) patients did not have any long term complications. In contrast, 16 cases
   (15.8%) developed persistent complications (present please), the most prevalent of which was
   fistula observed in 5 cases (3%). Other complications included recurrent chordee, meatal
   stenosis, glans, urethral dehiscence, and ventral scarring of the glans (diagram 2 and Table 1).
   Severe immediate post-op edema was seen in 8 cases (7.9%) on the first after surgery. This could
   be because of manipulations in lymphatic drainage during dissections. Dysuria and UTI were
   reported in 23 (22.8%) and 2 cases (2%), respectively. Based on the research survey, surgical
   results were satisfying to 100 (99%) parents in terms of cosmetic and functional results.
    The study variables in the complicated and non-complicated groups are compared and
    summarized in Table 1. Width of the UP in the flaccid penis, length of UP in the erect penis, and
    location of meatus emerged as significant predictors of complications. However, UP width, in
    our study, was associated with poor outcomes. In all other measures, no statistical difference was
    observed (Table 1). Counterintuitively, the complicated group had a higher percentage of
    patients with the urethral plate width of ≥ 1 cm. (87.5% vs 48.2%, PV=0.004)
   In the case of the qualitative variables, the uncomplicated group had a higher percentage of
   patients with a distal original meatal location than the complicated group (91.8% vs 62.5%
   respectively, P.V = 0.01%)
   On multivariable analysis to find independent risk factors for complications, the width of the
   urethral plate was not significant (RR=0.94, P=0.61) when it was flaccid; neither was the length
   of the urethral plate (RR=0.9, P=0.93) when it was erect. Only the location of the urethral meatus
   (orifice) was significantly related to postoperative complications(RR=7.69, P=0.01). Post-
   operative acute events were not significantly associated with complications (RR=0.25, P=0.06).
   In patients with acute surgical site infection, 4 cases developed fistulas (50%), while in patients
   without acute infection, the fistula was observed in 2 cases (2.1%). Thus fistula formation was
   notably higher in the group with acute surgical site infection (P<0.001) (Diagram 3).
    DISCUSSION
   Approximately 1 out of every 10 distal hypospadias surgeries develops a complication. Surgeons
   attempt to identify risk factors for complications to make modifications in techniques to improve
                                                                        6

   their results [10]. In this study, we evaluated the results of the mid-shaft and distal hypospadias
   surgery in terms of potential factors predictive of complication. During 170 days of average
   follow-up time, late complications were noticed in 15.8% of the patients (Diagram 4). Studies
   conducted by Snodgrass et al [11], Aslam et al [12], Mane et al [13],Xu et al [14], and Springer
   [15], estimate the complications after TIP operation to be between 7 to 31%. o (Table 2). Thus,
   overall complications in our study (16%,) were consistent with other contemporary series.
   Meatal location: It has long been thought that the hypospadias with a distal meatal orifice,
   is less prone to complications than those with proximal defects [16-19].
   Spinoit et al studied the results of hypospadias surgery in 474 patients. In the univariate logistic
   regression analysis, among the statistically significant predictors related to re-operation were
   hypospadias being proximal [20]. Conversely, Arlen et al showed the meatal location to have no
   significance on multivariable analysis. They concluded it’d be more important considering the
   entire hypospadias complex anatomy in defining severity, rather than the meatal location merely
   [21].
   In our study, although on the single-variable analysis the length and width of the urethral plate,
   location of the meatal orifice, and acute events were significantly related to the complications. In
   the multivariable study, it was only the initial meatal location that was found to be statistically
   significant (p= 0.03) (Diagram 5). Accordingly, we concluded that the closer meatal orifice was
   to the coronal margin (as the threshold), the fewer complications existed (RR= 7.69, P=0.01).
   While the difference between complicated and uncomplicated groups regarding the meatal
   location was statistically significant (P=0.03), it is noted that the actual measured differences
   were small (1.5 in millimeters). This marginal difference wouldn’t be practically important from
   the technical point of view and it is difficult to envision how daily surgical practices would be
   modified.
   Width: Several studies have shown different results regarding the impact of the urethral plate
   width. In Holland and Smith’s study of 48 cases ages 3–7 years old, the width of the urethral
   plate was found to be directly associated with the development of a fistula. Their cut off point of
   urethral plate width for complications was found to be 8 millimeters [5]. Further studies by
   Sarhan et al, K.E. Chukwubuike et al, and Aboutaleb H confirmed this finding [22, 23]. In a
   study by Seleim significant connection between urethral plate width and complications was
   found with a cutoff value of less than 4 mm [24]. Arlen et al employed a scoring system called
   glans-urethral-meatus shaft (GMS) to evaluate the probability of hypospadias postsurgical
   events. This system was based on the size of glans, the specifications of the urethral plate, the
   meatal location, and the severity of shaft curvature. The proposed scoring system was able to
   anticipate the occurrence of post-surgery complications in this group of patients. Only the degree
   of chordee arose as an independent predictive factor in the multivariable study analysis. A major
   limitation of this study was its different reconstructive techniques were used [21].
    Other studies have failed to find any significant connection between UP width and complications
    [25-27].
   In summary, while previous studies have reported varying results about UP width, in our study
   the width was associated with the poor surgical outcomes in the single-variate analysis
   (RR=7.69, 0.004). However, it wasn’t significant in the multivariable study (P=0.61).
   It should be also noted that the width and depth of the urethral plate/groove are parameters that
   are connected, meaning that in a newborn with a urethral anomaly, the wider the ventral urethral
                                                                        7

   groove is, the less depth it will have. So one may consider the width and depth of the urethral
   plate together (fig. 2). This could be an interesting topic for future investigations.
   Fistula and surgical site infection: Fistula developed in 6 cases and wound
   infection in 8 cases (Diagram 3). We found a significant relationship between fistula formation
   and surgical site infection (P<0.001). None of the fistula cases had meatal or urethral stenosis.
   Infection along with relatively low vascularity may result in poor wound healing and resultant
   fistula. So, finding measures to reduce the rates of infection as a modifiable risk factor could be
   considerably helpful.
   Glans: Although smaller glans widths are thought to be associated with greater difficulty and
   perhaps complications, our study along with some other studies, hasn’t shown glans diameter to
   be a risk factor for complications after TIP [26-29]. Also we found no significant differences in
   glanular groove shapes ( complete cleft, incomplete cleft, flat ) between two groups. This result
   correlates well with a study performed by da Silva et al [26] . Other studies focusing on distal
   hypospadias have found a significant difference related to glans size [30, 31]. It’s not clear if
   these different results are because of variations and modifications in glansplasty technique by
   surgeons [10].
   Chordee:                 In terms of superficial chordee, there was no significant difference between
   complicated and uncomplicated groups. Severe chordee cases were excluded from our study.
   Severe chordee (or penile curvature) can be indicative of underlying severe hypoplasia of corpus
   spongiosum, Dartos, or Buck’s fascia in the urethral area, which suggests the severity of
   hypospadias defect is more profound and blood supply may be more limited. For this reason, the
   existence of Severe chordee per se may be a major risk factor for complications particularly
   fistulas, and can affect other variables in the study [32]. Including Severe chordee (or proximal
   hypospadias) into variables may lead to undervaluing or obscuring the role of other potential risk
   factors. It seems that this would be a point missed in some studies and might be one of their main
   limitations. Our study primarily aimed to eliminate this confounding error.
   It should be pointed out that in our study, the variables were measured and reported by a single
   observer. It has been shown that there are remarkable differences between observers in
   measuring the dimensions of the glans [21]. It is not crystal clear whether or not this limitation
   has been able to affect the results of the present study. The inter-observer variability
   measurements in future studies in this field will help.
   Because our study group consisted of children 1-3 years old, the results might not be the same
   for other age groups. We recommend determining prognostic actors for different age groups
   separately.
   Conclusion
   Although studies have been conducted by many authors in the hypospadias field, the current
   body of literature has been plagued by lack of age-matched patients, lack of controlling for
   meatal location, diversity in surgical techniques, surgeons’ multiplicity, or non-uniform
   distributions of study population ages. So, we tried to overcome these vulnerabilities by
   employing one repair technique, performed by a single surgeon, in all mid-to-distal hypospadias
   cases, with no substantial chordee, and enrolling a homogeneous study population. This
   prospective study, using multivariable analysis suggests that meatus location is the only
   significant predictor of the development of complications. However, this in an unmodifiable
                                                                        8

   factor before surgery. We also found that surgical site infection may have an association with
   fistula formation later on.
   We recognize that the follow-up period of 1 year could be considered short for hypospadias.
   Additionally, there is the inevitability of subtle anatomic variation in case series of this nature.
   Moreover, Last but not least, we propose considering a combination model of urethral depth and
   width with age-related adjustments for future studies as well as the inter-observer variability
   measurements. while we have focused on rigorously on standardizing multiple variables to
   ensure a homogenous population.
   Moreover, we found that in young children the wider the plate was, the more complications
   happened. Consequently, we hypostatized that in young children who their anatomical
   dimensions are almost in the same range, a combination of urethral width and depth should be
   considered in the investigation of prognostic factors for hypospadias repair outcomes. Since
   measurement of depth of urethral plate is challenging even in older children, urethral plate width
   might be the single most important dimension of urethral representing the clinical situation.
