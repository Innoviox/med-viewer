      Abstract: Though transfusion reaction is directly related to the transfusion component, while in
clinic, the transfusion component is related to the disease which the patient caught. As some of the
transfusion reactions could be life-threatening, estimating the incidence of transfusion reaction (in this
study, allergic and febrile non-haemolytic transfusion reaction only) of some specific categories of diseases
is helpful for the clinicians. According to the reported blood use in the specific departments, the number
of transfusion patients in these departments could be estimated. By Apriori algorithm the categories of
diseases which often encounter the transfusion reaction have been screened. It is found that the diseases
which belong to C00-C97, D00-D48, D50-D89, K00-K93, N00-N99 and O00-O99 (ICD-10) often encounter
transfusion reaction. The platelet transfusion patients whose diseases belong to C00-C97 would encounter
transfusion reaction with the incidence about 1%, which is much higher than the average incidence. The
incidence of transfusion reaction of the patients whose diseases belong to K00-K93, with plasma transfusion
might be higher than the average incidence, as the lower bound of the incidence equals to the average
incidence. Based on this study, it is suggested that attentions should be paid to the patients whose
diseases belong to C00-C97 with platelet transfusion to prevent them encountering the allergic transfusion
reaction.

1     Introduction
      Transfusion is a kind of therapeutic procedure performed in hospitalized patients [1]. It is well known
that errors in blood transfusion practices can lead to serious consequences for the recipient in terms
of morbidity and mortality [2]. The morbidity or mortality caused by transfusion are called adverse

transfusion reactions or transfusion reactions (TRs). The incidence of transfusion reaction is about 2‰
[3, 4]. Most of the transfusion reactions are related to immune reactions [5]. Allergic and febrile non-
haemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR) are the most common transfusion reactions which the clinicians
often meet. In this study the TRs that belong to allergy or FNHTR are of enough sample size, so in this
paper we only focus on these 2 kinds of transfusion reactions.
      For clinicians, attentions are paid to the diseases which the patients caught. They make decisions
whether the patient needs transfusion treatment according to the patient’s condition. As some mechanisms
of the TR still remain unknown [6,7], estimating the incidence of transfusion reaction corresponding to some
specific categories of diseases is better than judging the incidence of transfusion reactions by the average
incidence. This would be helpful for the clinician to prevent the transfusion patients from encountering
the transfusion reactions.
      Though the number of transfusion patients in the specific categories of diseases is supplied, it could be
roughly estimated by the blood use in the departments. The information of the transfusion reaction patients
(including the department which they were in, their categories of TRs and diseases, etc) has already been
collected in a database. This means that the interval or at least the lower bound of the incidence might
be estimated. To screen the specific categories of diseases which often encounter transfusion reaction, the
Apriori algorithm [8,9] is used. According to the number of samples which belong to the specific category of
diseases screened by Apriori algorithm, the lower bound or interval of the incidence of transfusion reaction
of specific category of diseases could be estimated.
2      Materials and methods
2.1     Ethical approval
      All patients involve in the study had given written informed consent by participating hospitals. The
current project was approved by the review board of the Research Ethics Committee of Institute of Blood
Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College on September 18,
2016 (registration number 2016017).
2.2     Materials
      The samples of transfusion reaction patients are supplied by the key laboratory of transfusion adverse
reaction. The Key laboratory of transfusion adverse reactions (Key laboratory) have been collecting the
clinical cases of transfusion reaction. 79 hospitals have joined the key laboratory. Apart from Xizang
province, the samples supplied by these hospitals are representative of the entire transfusion reaction
patients in the main land of China.
      From May 2018 to June 2019, 1255 cases had been collected. In this study the sample size of allergy
and FNHTR were large enough for statistical research. Among the 1255 cases, only 839 cases appeared to
be allergy or FNHTR. According to the clinical diagnoses, there are 754 confirmed cases. Table 1 shows

     The data in table 1 have only supplied the number of transfusion patients while the number of pa-
tients who belongs to the specific category of diseases that resulted in transfusion have not been supplied.
Estimating the incidence of transfusion reaction needs 2 kinds of information: the number of transfusion
patients who belonged to a specific category of diseases, and how many of them showed transfusion reac-
tions. The former has not been supplied, so it needs estimation and the latter has been supplied by the
key laboratory. The ”Chinese clinical blood use Research Report (2016)” is helpful for the estimation.
This report has been completed in 2017, which has shown the proportion of blood use in the departments
is shown in table 2.

2.3    Estimation of the number of transfusion patients
     Following table 2, estimate the average blood dosage in each of the department first. With the average
dosage the number of transfusion patients in each of the department could be estimated. According to the
transfusion dosage record supplied by the hospitals, the estimated average transfusion dosage is shown in
table 3.
     According to table 3 and table 1-2, the number of transfusion patients in each of the department could
be estimated in table 4.
     Table 4 supplies the base information of the number of transfusion patients. The total number of
transfusion patients figured by table 4 is larger than the total number supplied by table 1. The reason is
that some patients were transfused by more than one kind of component and some transfusions had been
stopped when encountered with acute TRs. These situations lead to the errors of average dosage estimation.
The estimated number is larger than the number of person per time in table 1. By calculation, the actual
                                                                       3

number of transfusion person per time is 0.85 times of the estimated number of transfusion person per
time. Though it is not able to know exact number of transfusion patients who caught the specific disease,
the number of transfusion patients in each of the departments has already given the interval of the number
of transfusion patients who caught the specific category of the diseases.
2.4    Estimation of the incidence of transfusion reaction
     By intuition, some categories of diseases encounter transfusion reaction more frequently. The trans-
fusion component is associated with the patient’s condition and the patient’s condition is relevant to the
disease which the patient caught. The causality is this: the disease which the patient caught resulted in
the transfusion component the clinician chose, and the transfusion component and the patient’s condi-
tion resulted in the transfusion reaction. The causes which result in transfusion reaction form a chain of
causality. Each of the TR patients produces a chain of causality.
     The transfusion patients are divided into the groups according to the departments’ classification in
table 2-4. The causes of each of the samples are divided into 4 parts: the disease which the patient
caught, the reason for transfusion, the immune history of the patient, the component which the patient
was transfused. The information of all samples is supplied by the Key laboratory. Schematic graph of the
relation of causes is shown in figure 1
                                                                       4

                                 Figure 1: The causality network of transfusion reaction
     The support and confidence of the combination of these causes could be figured out by apriori algo-
rithm. The larger the support is, the stronger the association with the disease and the transfusion reaction.
Collecting the frequently encountered combination of the causes, it is possible to estimate the incidence of
transfusion reaction of a certain category of diseases.
     The minimal support in the Apriori algorithm is set as 10−4 . This means that as long as a chain
of causality is found, this chain of causality is considered to be associated with the transfusion reaction.
But in practice we choose the minimum support like this: if the support of the chain of causality is lower
than 0.05 in the 4 causes-combination, or 0.04 in the 5 causes-combination, this causality chain is taken
into consideration. The reason is that the sample size of transfusion reaction in each of the departments
are not as large as the sample size of customers’ purchasing behavior. Though a low support of a certain
kind of combination might indicate that this could be a causality chain, it is difficult to conclude that this
combination is of statistical significance.
3    Results
     The estimated incidence of transfusion reaction in each of the departments is shown in tables 5-10.
The classification of disease is in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision
(ICD-10). By Apriori algorithm, 7 kinds of diseases that would frequently encounter transfusion reaction
were found. According to reference [10] (figure 3), the incidence of cancer in China is 2‰. In the internal
department, according to the record supplied by the key laboratory, i.e. all the patients had transfusion
reaction (allergy or FNHTR), 137 out of 408 patients in total were cancer patients. It could be reasonable
to estimate that in the internal department 20% of the patients might be cancer patients. And according
to the data supplied by the Key laboratory, in the internal department, nearly 1/3 (33 out of 109) of the
patients whose disease belonged to D50-D89 also caught cancer. That is why the upper bound of the
incidence of transfusion reaction of the diseases belonged to C00-C99 and D50-D89 would be estimated in
the internal department.
     Remarks: In table 5, myelosuppression after chemotherapy could result in thrombocytopenia, so the
bound of the ATR patients belonged to C00-C97 is estimated as (64, 89). Similarly, the bound for the ATR
patients belonged to D50-D89 is (30, 49) (according to table 11). The total number of transfusion patients
who were transfused by the specific kind component is shown in table 4. It has been assumed that 20%
of the patients in the internal department belong to C00-C93. And as 1/3 of the patients whose diseases
                                                                       5

belonged to D50-D89 also caught cancer, it could be assumed that 0.3 × 20% = 6% of the patients in the
internal department belong to D50-D89. In table 7, bleeding would result in anemia (according to table
13), so the bound for the ATR patients belonged to O00-D99 is (12, 15), but the patients who need plasma
transfusing in the gynaecology and obstetrics department not all belong to O00-O99. So the upper bound
of the incidence could not be estimated. In table 9, the lower bound of the number of cancer patients is
estimated by 53. Though according to table 15, bleeding is related to thrombocytopenia, but according to
the raw data supplied by the key laboratory, only 1 sample showed both bleeding and thrombocytopenia.
In table 10, it is also assumed that 20% of the patients in the department out of the above belong to
C00-C93.
     The detailed information of the support and the combinations of the causes are shown in tables 11-
16 which show the support of the combination of the causes in each of the departments. These tables
supply the support information for tables 5-10. According to table 11-16, apart from the gynaecology
and obstetrics department, the diseases which belong to C00-C97, K00-K93 and D50-D89 encounter the
transfusion reaction frequently. The transfusion components which would most probably cause allergy
are platelet and plasma. The component red cell causes FNHTR mainly occurs in the gynaecology and
obstetrics department.
     The guidelines of transfusion reaction [2,11] have mentioned that immune history especially transfusion
history is related to transfusion reaction, the causality chains found in table 11-16 are consistent with that
view. The patients whose disease belonged to the classifications C00-C97, D50-D89 or K00-K93 often
received transfusion treatment. These diseases result in repeated transfusion treatment may be a cause of
transfusion reaction.

4      Conclusion and Discussion
      It has already been discussed in section 3, the diseases which frequently encounter transfusion reaction
most probably belong to thees classifications: C00-C97, K00-K93 and D50-D89. According to tables 5-10,
the incidence of transfusion reaction is high in the group of cancer patients, especially when the platelet
is transfused. In the paediatrics department the cancer patients’ transfusion reaction is nearly 10 times
of the average incidence. The patients whose disease belonged to the classifications C00-C97, D50-D89
or K00-K93 may received repeated transfusion treatment. These diseases result in repeated transfusion
treatment may be a cause of transfusion reaction. This result is consistent with the previous study.
      Without mechanism study, the information is extracted from the data base. So attentions should be
paid to the cancer patients who need platelet transfusion. So far the samples of the transfusion reaction
are not large. If the samples are large enough, the information of transfusion reactions such as transfusion
associated circulatory overload, transfusion related acute lung injury etc which might related to some
certain kind of disease could be extracted by the similar way. This study only shows a method to estimate
the incidence of transfusion reaction. If the information of the number of transfusion patients who belong
to the specific kind of disease is known, the estimation would be more accurate.
