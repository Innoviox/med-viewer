   Abstract
   Background: The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that SARS-CoV-2, the virus
   that causes the disease, has the potential to spread exponentially. Therefore, as long as a substantial
   proportion of the population remains susceptible to infection, the potential for new epidemic waves
   persists even in settings with low numbers of active COVID-19 infections, unless sufficient
   countermeasures are in place. In this study, we examine the Australian state of New South Wales, a
   setting with prolonged low transmission, high mobility, non-universal mask usage, and a well-
   functioning test-and-trace system. We investigate how vulnerable the state would be to resurgences
   in COVID-19 transmission under variations in the levels of testing, tracing, and mask usage.
   Methods: We use a stochastic agent-based model, calibrated to the New South Wales epidemic and
   policy environment, to simulate possible epidemic outcomes over October 1 – December 31, 2020,
   under a range of assumptions about contact tracing efficacy, testing rates, and mask uptake.
   Results: We find that the relative impact of masks is greatest when testing and tracing rates are
   lower (and vice versa). With very high testing rates (90% of people with symptoms, plus 90% of people
   with a known history of contact with a confirmed case), we estimate that the epidemic would remain
   under control until at least the end of 2020, with as little as 70–110 new infections estimated over
   October 1 – December 31 under high mask uptake scenarios, or 340–1,400 without masks, depending
   on the efficacy of community contact tracing. However, across comparable levels of mask uptake
   and contact tracing, the number of infections over this period would be up to 6 times higher if the
   testing rate was 80% instead of 90%, 17 times higher if the testing rate was 65%, or more than 100
   times higher with a 50% testing rate.
   Conclusions: Our work suggests that testing, tracing and masks can all be effective means of
   controlling transmission in dynamic community settings. A multifaceted strategy that combines all
   three, alongside continued hygiene and distancing protocols, is likely to be the most robust means
   of controlling community-based transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

   Introduction
   Across the world, governmental responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have already
   profoundly curtailed the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease. As the pandemic
   unfolded during the second half of 2020, the nature of the governmental responses also evolved. An
   increasing number of countries moved from an initial crisis-management phase into a new phase
   centred around minimising transmission risk while allowing societal and economic activities to
   resume (1). In this paper, we focus on three key components of this phase: masks (either mandatory
   or recommended in certain settings), testing, and contact tracing, whereby those known to have been
   in contact with a confirmed case are required to test and/or quarantine. When used in combination
   with physical distancing and hand hygiene measures, all three strategies allow relatively high
   mobility: testing and contact tracing means that only those at greatest risk of transmitting the virus
   need to stay home, while masks mean that people with undiagnosed infections present less of a risk
   to others (2–4).
   Given the complexities of COVID-19 transmission, including the duration of pre-symptomatic
   infection (5,6), the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic (7), and the possibility of
   transmission via surface contact (8), maintaining control of COVID-19 has proven challenging in
   many jurisdictions (9–13). The often-cited success stories of Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, and South
   Korea included high mask usage, high rates of testing, and fast, effective contact tracing (14–16). The
   benefits of a multi-pronged approach have also been illustrated in the literature; in the UK, for
   example, a recent study (17) found that mandating masks in secondary schools could achieve
   approximately the same reduction in resurgence risk as having an 8-11% increase in symptomatic
   testing.
   In this work, we use an agent-based model to estimate the combination of testing, community-based
   contact tracing, and mask usage required to maintain epidemic control in a low-transmission, high-
   mobility setting. The context for our study is the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), with
   a population of 7.5 million and just over 4000 diagnosed cases as of September 30, 2020. Over the
   period from June 1 – September 30, 2020, masks were recommended by the government for the
   general public and made mandatory for staff in various businesses including supermarkets. Across
   Australia, 58% of people reported wearing masks in mid-August, including all Victorians (18); the
   proportion of people in NSW wearing masks has not been reported, although CCTV footage from
   August registered ~30% of passengers on urban public transport wearing masks (19). At the same
   time, high levels of testing (~20,000 tests/day) and rapid contact tracing were in place, with notable
   focus on contact tracing. The state health department (NSW Health) required all businesses to have
   a COVID-19 Safety Plan, and for the majority of public-facing businesses this included a requirement
   for customers to register their details upon entry. Upon identifying a new case, NSW Health’s contact
   tracers would then (a) conduct an extended interview to determine all possible venues in which
   transmission may have occurred, (b) place details of those venues on their website, on social media,
   and in newspapers, urging people who had been at the venue to self-isolate for 14 days, (c) attempt
   to contact all people who were registered to have been at venues within a given window of the time
   that the diagnosed case was known to have been there and instruct them to self-isolate for 14 days.
   Over the four months from June 1 – September 30, 2020 while this strategy was in place,
   approximately 900 new cases were identified, and only 45 (5%) of these were locally acquired and not
   linked to known clusters (20).

   This paper builds on previous work in which we estimated the probability of epidemic rebound
   following a prolonged period of low, stable transmission and relatively high community mobility (21),
   assuming that 25% of contacts encountered in locations that require customer registration (including
   restaurants, cafes, bars, pubs, sports/leisure/fitness centres, arts venues, places of worship, and large
   events) could be traced within two weeks. However, in this study we consider a range of testing and
   contact tracing levels, and assess the balance between masks, testing and contact tracing as a means
   of controlling community-based transmission.
   Methods
   Transmission model
   As in our previous study (21), we used an open-source agent-based model, Covasim (22), developed
   by the Institute for Disease Modeling with source code and documentation available at
   https://covasim.org. To simulate the epidemic and policy environment in New South Wales over
   March 1 – September 30, 2020, we include parameter changes that capture the testing, tracing,
   isolation, quarantine, and lockdown policies that were enacted over this time (summarised in Table
   S1), as well as the introduction of interstate cases in late June prior to the closure of the state border
   with neighbouring Victoria. We then calibrate the model by adjusting the per-contact transmission
   rate to fit data on the daily number of cases diagnosed, excluding cases acquired overseas or
   interstate, by performing an automated search for the values of the per-contact transmission risk
   and the number of seed infections that minimised the absolute differences between the model
   projections and the data (Figure 1). All data and code used in these analyses are available via Github
   (https://github.com/optimamodel/covid_nsw).
   Figure 1. Calibration of the model to the NSW epidemic. Solid lines indicate the median model
   projections over 20 model runs; shaded areas indicate 95% projected intervals over different
   initialisations; blue diamonds indicate data on confirmed locally-acquired cases.
   Model analysis
   We run the model from October 1, 2020, until December 31, 2020, using a set of assumptions about
   future testing rates, the efficacy of contact tracing, and mask uptake. For testing rates, we distinguish
   between symptom-based testing and testing of asymptomatic contacts. NSW Health guidelines
   advise anyone with symptoms to get tested, as well as anyone identified as a contact regardless of
   symptoms (23). To reflect this, we use a baseline assumption that the testing rate for asymptomatic
   contacts is the same as for people with symptoms, and run a counterfactual set of scenarios in which
   it is assumed to be half the rate for those with symptoms (Table 1).

   Table 1: overview of the 160 scenarios (4x2x5x4) analysed over Oct 1 – Dec 31, 2020.
   To model the efficacy of contact tracing, we assume that 100% of household contacts will be traced
   and notified on the same day that test results are communicated, and that 95% of school contacts
   and 90% of workplace contacts will be notified on the following day. We then consider scenarios in
   which 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% of all other contacts (which we refer to as community contacts)
   can be traced within a week of a case notification. For each scenario, the time to trace each contact
   is drawn from a scaled Poisson distribution with a mean of 1 day (Figure S1). We also assume that
   0%, 25%, 50%, or 75% of the population will wear masks in dynamic community settings (i.e., settings
   in which people interact with strangers or random groups of people), which in the model includes
   arts venues, large events such as concerts, festivals, sports games, public parks and other outdoor
   settings, public transport, and all other community settings. We run 20 simulations for each
   permutation of testing rates, mask usage and contact tracing efficacy.
   For all simulations, we assume that masks will reduce the per-contact probability of transmission by
   30%, in line with estimates from (24). We also assume that people who have been contact-traced will
   quarantine with 90% efficacy from their workplace, school, and community contacts. Test results are
   assumed to be communicated within 24 hours (25).
   Results
   Estimates of daily new infections under each scenario are presented in Figure 2. A key finding
   highlighted by Figure 2 is how effective high levels of testing are in maintaining epidemic control: all
   strategies in which there is at least some contact tracing in place and testing rates are very high (90%
   of people with symptoms and 90% of asymptomatic contacts of confirmed cases) lead to a robustly
   controlled epidemic, with as little as 70–110 new infections estimated over October 1 – December 31
   under high mask uptake scenarios, or 340–1,400 without masks, with the ranges depending on the
   efficacy of community contact tracing (Figure 2, bottom row). However, holding mask uptake and
   contact tracing constant, we estimate that the number of infections over October 1 – December 31,
   2020, would be up to 6 times higher if the testing rate was 80% instead of 90%, 17 times higher if the
   testing rate was 65%, or more than 100 times higher with a 50% testing rate (Figure 2, third row).
   A second key finding is that the lower the testing rate, the greater the impact of masks and contact
   tracing (and vice versa). With medium-lower testing rates of 50% or 65%, the marginal impact of both
   masks and contact tracing are considerable (Figure 2, top two rows). Under these scenarios, the most
   robust strategies consist of a combination of masks and community contact tracing. Assuming a 50%
   testing rate, a scenario with near-perfect tracing and no masks is approximately equivalent to a

   scenario with no tracing and high mask uptake. However, without community contact tracing, a
   reduction in mask usage from 75% to 50% would lead to a near-doubling in estimated infections (from
   11,500 to 21,800), whereas even moderate levels of community contact tracing (25% traceable within
   a week) would increase the robustness of the response to lower mask usage (with 9,260 infections
   estimated under 75% mask usage and 13,700 under 50% mask usage). Similarly, masks strengthen
   the resilience of the epidemic outcome to decreases in contact tracing efficacy: without masks, a
   reduction in community contact tracing from 100% to 75% would lead to a 40% increase in total
   infections, whereas it would have no impact if 75% of the population were wearing masks.

   and mask uptake (line colours). Projections represent the median of 20 simulations. Text boxes in
   each panel displays the cumulative number of infections over October 1 – December 31, 2020.
   If asymptomatic contacts only test at half the rate of people with symptoms, we estimate a more
   severe epidemic over the last quarter of 2020. In Figure 3 we highlight a particular set of scenarios
   corresponding to the most optimistic contact tracing assumptions, in which all community contacts
   are assumed to be traced within one week, with a mean time to trace of one day (the full set of
   scenarios are summarised in Figure S2). Within this set of scenarios, the total number of infections
   is estimated to be around 50% higher if asymptomatic contacts test at a lower rate than people with
   symptoms (averaged across all levels of mask usage).

   Discussion
   In this work we present estimates illustrating the extent to which masks, community testing, and
   community contact tracing can reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in New South Wales, Australia.
   We found that the relative impact of masks is greatest when testing and tracing rates are lower (and
   vice versa). With very high testing rates (90% of people with symptoms, plus 90% of people with a
   known history of contact with a confirmed case), we estimate that the epidemic in New South Wales
   would remain under control until at least the end of 2020, provided that fast and effective contact
   tracing is in place. If testing rates are lower, we estimate that mask use can play an important role
   in reducing the potential for epidemic resurgence.
   Of the interventions considered, this study suggests that maintaining high levels of symptomatic
   testing, contact tracing, and testing of contacts is the most important. Longer term, there may be
   challenges associated with maintaining high levels of testing, mask use, and contact tracing. If daily
   case numbers remain low and the perceived threat of COVID-19 declines, community fatigue may
   influence testing behaviours, particularly for mild cases of COVID-19. There may also be a decline in
   mask use. Individuals may become less compliant with sign-in procedures, and venues may also
   become less vigilant in enforcing these procedures. This study suggests that having high levels of
   any two of mask use, testing and contact tracing can partly mitigate the need for the third; however
   practical challenges mean that this is unlikely to occur, and a more multifaceted approach of aiming
   for high coverage of all three and ending up with moderate coverage of all three may be an effective
   and more robust strategy.
   Although various efforts have been made to synthesise the ever-expanding body of research
   regarding the efficacy of different interventions, each country’s epidemic has distinct characteristics,
   and there are very few standardised, globally-applicable guidelines on what constitutes a best-
   practice public health strategy. As a result, jurisdictions have taken diverse approaches in terms of
   which interventions to prioritise, from a list that includes physical distancing, travel restrictions,
   wearing of masks or face coverings, isolation and/or testing of those with COVID-like symptoms,
   isolation of those who test positive, and tracing the contacts of confirmed cases for testing and/or
   quarantining. Although it may not always be articulated as such, numerous trade-offs are being
   made between different policy options in an attempt to allow the highest degree of societal activity
   commensurate with epidemic control. In New South Wales, mask use has been encouraged in
   particular settings since July, but not mandated; at the same time, there has been a strong focus on

   contact tracing. The results from this work suggest that the prioritisation of contact tracing may
   mitigate the relative importance of masks to some extent, but that this relies on continued high levels
   of community testing.
   There are several limitations to this study. Firstly, the mathematical model that we use requires data
   on various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and prevention that are still not known exactly,
   including the effects of masks on preventing individual transmission and the proportion of infections
   that are asymptomatic. Whilst we have used the best available data and sampled from appropriate
   distributions where possible, this represents a source of uncertainty in all mathematical models of
   COVID-19. Secondly, we have constructed sets of scenarios that examine various combinations of
   parameters on mask uptake, contact tracing, testing of people with symptoms, and asymptomatic
   contact testing, but there are many more parameters that determine the dynamics of transmission,
   including the stringency of border control measures, people’s adherence to quarantine and isolation
   policies, and the effect of ongoing distancing policies. Changes to any of these policies would affect
   the results presented here in ways that are not straightforward to predict or extrapolate. Third, we
   have not considered any outbreak risk associated with newly seeded cases in the community that
   may arise from international or interstate arrivals. Finally, the model used here does not contain a
   geospatial component, and we have not considered heterogeneities in incidence, behaviour, or
   contact patterns across different parts of the state in these analyses. This could be relevant for
   questions around mask uptake, as uptake of masks is generally higher in more densely populated
   areas, so using a state-wide average for the proportion of the population wearing masks may
   underestimate their impact, especially since >90% of infections in NSW to date have occurred in the
   Sydney metropolitan area.
   Conclusions
   Our work suggests that testing, tracing and masks can be effective means of controlling transmission
   in dynamic community settings, and higher compliance with one can offset lower compliance with
   the other to some extent. However, pursuing a strategy that combines aggressive testing, high mask
   usage, and effective contact tracing, alongside continued hygiene and distancing protocols, is likely
   to be the most robust means of controlling community-based transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

    Setting               Description of policy changes and their effects
    Schools               School attendance rates in NSW had already dropped by 25% by 15 March 2020
                          (1), and on 23 March 2020 the NSW Premier advised that although schools
                          remained open, parents were encouraged to keep their children at home for online
                          learning (2). School attendance rates subsequently dropped to 5% of their pre-
                          COVID levels (3). However, attendance quickly returned to pre-COVID levels
                          shortly after schools reopened in mid-May (4). To model this, we removed 95% of
                          contacts between school children and then restored them again as schools opened,
                          but with the relative transmission risk set to 80% of its pre-March levels to account
                          for additional safety measures in place for school activities (5).
    Workplaces            According to survey data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, almost half of
                          working Australians were working from home in late April/early May (6), which is
                          roughly consistent with Google movement data indicating that 40% fewer people
                          were at work over that period compared to baseline. Workplace-based activities
                          increased as COVID restrictions eased, but remained 15% lower over June-July
                          compared to baseline. In the model, we removed 50% of workplace contacts and
                          then restored them so that the workplace network was back to 85% of its pre-
                          COVID size by the beginning of July (Figure 1). As with schools, we set the relative

                          transmission risk set to 80% of its pre-March levels to account for the presence of
                          NPIs.
    Static                We assume that almost no contacts occurred over these networks from March 23
    community             to May 1 with the exception of the limited contacts arising from permitted single-
                          person visits., These networks were gradually restored over the period from May
                          1 to July 9 as restrictions eased.
    Dynamic               Within New South Wales, arts venues such as museums, galleries, theatres, and
    community             cinemas, large events such as concerts, festivals, sports games, and pubs/bars were
    networks              all closed over the period from March 23 to May 15, after which the networks were
    over      May-        gradually restored. Cafes and restaurants, public parks and other outdoor settings,
    July                  public transport, and all other community settings including essential retail
    (negligible           remained open in some capacity throughout the year but with decreased demand
    mask usage)           and operational restrictions to reduce the likelihood of transmission (e.g.,
                          takeaway service only, closure of playgrounds, capacity limits on transport, and
                          physical distancing/hygiene).
    Dynamic               From August 3, 2020, the use of masks was mandated in Victoria, which led to a
    community             marked increase in mask usage across the country. Only 13% of Australians wore
    networks              a mask at least once over the month of June, but 58% reported wearing one at least
    over August           once over August 7–17, 2020 (99% of Victorian residents compared to 44% of
    (increased            residents of other states) (7). Within New South Wales, media sources reported
    mask usage)           that 30% of people were wearing face masks on public transport in central Sydney
                          in mid-August (8). To reflect the gradual increase in mask uptake in the model, we
                          adjust the relative transmission risk assuming that the proportion of adults who
                          wore masks while at work and in dynamic community settings increased over
                          August to reach 30% by the end of the month.
    Testing,              We assume that the daily testing probability for those with symptoms increased
    tracing, and from 5% in April to 20% by the beginning of June. Assuming a symptomatic period
    isolation             of roughly 10 days, this implies that the proportion of symptomatic people who
                          get tested increased from 40% to 90%. In addition to symptom-based testing, we
                          also assume that 90% of people who are not symptomatic but have been told to
                          quarantine as a result of having been in contact with a confirmed case will get
                          tested.
                          To model the efficacy of contact tracing over the period from June 1 – September
                          30, 2020, we assume that all household contacts were traced and notified on the
                          same day that test results were communicated, that 95% of school contacts and
                          90% of workplace contacts were notified on the following day, and that 50% of all
                          other contacts (which we refer to as community contacts) were traced within a
                          week of a case notification, with a mean time to trace of one day (Figure S1). Note
                          that these are more optimistic assumptions than were included in our previous
                          study (9).
                          We assume that confirmed cases will isolate with near-perfect effectiveness,
                          meaning that the probability of them transmitting to school or workplace contacts

                          is zero, and the probability of them transmitting to their household contacts is
                          reduced by 80%. Similarly, we assume high levels of adherence to isolation policies
                          imposed on those who have been notified that they were in contact with a
                          confirmed case, with a 90% reduction in their probability of transmitting to school
                          or workplace contacts.

    and border requiring all arrivals to quarantine for two weeks in a hotel. These policies are
