    Abstract
    We aimed to characterize real-world use of antivirals and antibiotics in patients with
    COVID-19 and their associations with mortality. We conducted a real-world
    retrospective cohort study in 688 primary-to-tertiary medical units in Mexico City;
    395,343 patients were evaluated for suspected COVID-19 between February 24 and
    September 14, 2020. All patients with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (n=137,012)
    were included; those receiving unspecified antivirals (n=137), excluded, and groups of
    antivirals with <30 patients (n=20), eliminated. Survival and mortality risk analyses were
    done for patients receiving antivirals, antibiotics, both, or none (exposition groups).
    136,855 patients were analyzed; mean age 44.2 (SD:16.8) years; 51.3% were men.
    16.6% received an antiviral (3%), antibiotic (10%), or both (3.6%). More symptomatic
    patients received antivirals and antibiotics more often. Antivirals studied were
    Oseltamivir (n=8414), Amantadine (n=319), Lopinavir-Ritonavir (n=100), Rimantadine
    (n=61), Zanamivir (n=39), and Acyclovir (n=36). Survival with antivirals (73.7%, P<.001)
    and antibiotics (85.8%, P<.001) was lower than no antiviral/antibiotic (93.6%) in the
    general population. Increased risk of death was observed with antivirals in ambulatory
    (HR=4.7, 95%CI:3.94-5.62) and non-critical (HR=2.03, 95%CI:1.86-2.21) patients; no
    benefit in hospitalized and critical patients. Oseltamivir was associated with increased
    mortality in the general population (HR=1.72, 95%CI:1.61-1.84), ambulatory (HR=4.79,
    95%CI:4.01-5.75), non-critical (HR=2.05, 95%CI:1.88-2.23), and pregnancy (HR=8.35,
    95%CI:1.77-39.30). Antibiotics were a protective factor in hospitalized (HR=0.81,
    95%CI:0.77-0.86) and critical patients (HR=0.67, 95%CI:0.63-0.72), but a risk factor in
    the general population (HR=1.13, 95%CI:1.08-1.19) and children and adolescents
                                                                                                                                       3

    (HR=4.22, 95%CI:2.01-8.86). In conclusion, oseltamivir was associated with increased
    mortality or no benefit in all groups. Common antivirals for COVID-19 should be
    avoided. Antibiotics may increase survival in hospitalized and critical patients.
    Vaccination history and rapid differentiation of etiologic agent will be key to promptly
    initiate or avoid antivirals during the COVID-19-influenza season.

    Introduction
    The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the
    coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, one of the most devastating infectious
    diseases of this century. Non-pharmacological interventions are the most effective
    means of limiting the impact of COVID-19 to date (1,2). However, several countries
    have not been able to contain the disease through such measures (3).
    One of the main strategies for finding ways to combat COVID-19 has been drug
    repurposing since developing novel antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 may be protracted
    (4).    Repurposing existing antivirals is an attractive approach due to their relative
    safeness and potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms (5). Up to October 2, 2020 there
    were 369 registered studies to test antivirals for COVID-19, of which 360 were still
    active (6). The majority of trials in the World Health Organization (WHO) platform were
    for lopinavir/ritonavir (176), remdesivir (41), favipiravir (29), oseltamivir (18), and
    ribavirin (16) (7). Thus, comprehensive evidence for these antivirals may be available
    shortly. Other common antivirals are not being tested for COVID-19 but could be having
    widespread use in the community and hospitals since practice guidelines do not
    discourage or recommend most antivirals due to a lack of evidence (8,9), others advice
    against most (10-12), or recommend oseltamivir empirically during the influenza season
    (13) and when coinfection exists (14).
    Real-world data studies may reveal valuable information not encountered in
    conventional interventional studies; while pragmatic clinical trials are designed to obtain
    answers for real-world problems, most other clinical trials are not, often having strict
                                                                                                                                       5

    selection criteria (15). Therefore, real-world studies have the potential to become into
    real-world evidence with immediate impact on policymaking (16,17).
    In Mexico, epidemiologic surveillance of viral respiratory diseases started in 2006 and
    has expanded to include monitoring units representative of the Mexican population
    (18,19). Follow-up and reporting of cases, including monitorization of antivirals and
    antibiotics have been occurring since. This surveillance system was adapted to monitor
    COVID-19 and open datasets for Mexico (20) and Mexico City (21) were made
    available, the latter including use of antivirals and antibiotics.
    In this study, we sought to characterize the use of antivirals and antibiotics in patients
    with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Mexico City and their associations with mortality.
    Methods
    Study Design
    We conducted a real-world multicenter retrospective cohort study in patients who
    received medical attention for suspected COVID-19 in any of the registered and
    accredited COVID-19 medical units in Mexico City, to evaluate mortality (main outcome)
    in those receiving antivirals, antibiotics, both, or none (exposition groups).
    We considered 395,343 patients for eligibility who had been evaluated for COVID-19 in
    688 medical units (primary-to-tertiary care) between February 24, 2020 and September
    14, 2020. All patients with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were included to
    maximize the power and generalizability of the study. Patients treated with an
    unspecified antiviral were excluded. To perform reliable analyses, a cut-off value of 30
                                                                                                                                       6

    patients receiving the same antiviral was set and groups of antivirals with <30 patients
    were eliminated.
    Source of Data and Management of Variables
    We used the COVID-19 open dataset available in Mexico City Government’s Open Data
    platform (21), collected and updated daily by the Secretariat of Health of Mexico City.
    Patients meeting criteria of suspected COVID-19 case have been included in this
    dataset starting on February 24, 2020 when the first suspected cases arrived in Mexico.
    Criteria for suspected COVID-19 case in Mexico included having at least two of three
    signs/symptoms (cough, fever, or headache) plus at least one other (dyspnea,
    arthralgias, myalgias, sore throat, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis, or chest pain) in the last 7
    days. This operational definition was changed on August 24, 2020 to increase sensitivity
    (22): at least one of four signs/symptoms (cough, fever, dyspnea, or headache), plus at
    least one other (myalgias, arthralgias, sore throat, chills, chest pain, rhinorrhea,
    anosmia, dysgeusia, or conjunctivitis) in the last 10 days.
    For epidemiologic purposes, two strategies are outlined in the National COVID-19
    Epidemiologic Surveillance Plan (22): 1. testing of 10% of ambulatory patients with mild
    symptoms of respiratory disease and 100% of patients with respiratory distress at
    evaluation in monitoring units of viral respiratory disease (USMER, for its acronym in
    Spanish), and 2. testing 100% of patients who meet diagnostic criteria of Severe Acute
    Respiratory Infection (defined as shortness of breath, temperature ≥38 °C, cough, and
    ≥1 of the following: chest pain, tachypnea, or acute respiratory distress syndrome) in
    non-USMER units.
                                                                                                                                       7

    Upon evaluating a patient suspected of having COVID-19, healthcare professionals are
    required to fill out a format (Supplementary Appendix 1) containing demographic,
    clinical, epidemiological, and treatment variables, later complemented with follow-up by
    accredited hospital epidemiologists (inpatients) and healthcare professionals in primary
    care units (ambulatory patients). For ambulatory patients, follow-up is performed daily
    for a minimum 7 days and patients are considered recovered 14 days after the onset of
    symptoms if alive and not hospitalized. For hospitalized patients, follow-up is done daily
    until death or discharge; follow-up time for patients discharged from hospital is highly
    variable since no consensus or requirements by authorities exist but may extend from
    14 days to 3-6 months after discharge. Duration of follow-up for each patient is not
    provided in the dataset and cannot be calculated.
    For every medical unit there is only one responsible authority who ultimately uploads
    data into the Respiratory Diseases Epidemiologic Surveillance System and is
    accountable for accuracy. Results of diagnostic RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 are directly
    uploaded by the diagnostic facility; accreditation of diagnostic procedures by the
    Mexican Institute of Diagnostics and Epidemiological Reference is required to upload
    results. Reporting of all deaths of COVID-19 suspected or confirmed cases is obligatory
    and must be done in the first 48 hours after occurrence; in cases of deaths occurring in
    patients who had completed follow-up, registries are matched to death certificates and
    updated. There have been concerns that patients tested more than once may be
    duplicated. Since no variables that could lead to identification of patients are released,
    we searched for patients with identical demographic variables and only one registry was
    kept.
                                                                                                                                       8

    Management of Variables
    All categorical variables were classified as dummy variables (present/absent).
    Polytomous variables were created from frequencies of use of antivirals and antibiotics
    (no antiviral/antibiotic, antiviral only, antibiotic only, and antiviral plus antibiotic), type of
    antiviral with >30 patients, and the combination of every individual antiviral with
    antibiotics. These were considered as the exposition groups. Special populations for
    subgroup analyses were defined as: children and adolescents (<18 years), pregnancy,
    puerperium, and non-pregnant/puerperal adults (≥18 years). Further subgroups
    included ambulatory and hospitalized patients, as well as patients admitted to intensive
    care unit (ICU) and those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). A variable of
    critical patients was built by grouping patients admitted to ICU and/or requiring IMV,
    whereas non-critical patients did not meet any of both.
    Since it has been hypothesized that early use of antivirals in COVID-19 could diminish
    hospitalization rate (23) and detain disease progression (24), thereby decreasing
    mortality, we distinguished early (≤2 days from symptom onset to initiation of antivirals)
    from late (>2 days) use of antivirals, and studied their relation to hospitalization rates
    and mortality; only patients with complete dates for all three variables (symptom onset,
    hospitalization [if required], and initiation of antivirals) were included for analysis.
    Occupations were grouped as follows: technical services (laborers), education (students
    and teachers), healthcare (dentists, nurses, diagnostic laboratorian, physicians, and
    other healthcare workers), agricultural activities (peasants), commerce (drivers, informal
                                                                                                                                       9

    parents and retired/pensioners), and other occupations (others, and other professions).
    Statistical Analysis
    Descriptive data were calculated and are provided as frequencies, percentages, mean
    with standard deviation (SD) or median with interquartile range (IQR). Qualitative
    comparisons were made with χ2 or Fisher´s exact test. Independent-samples t-test and
    ANOVA were used for quantitative comparisons. Survival was calculated for all
    treatment groups (antiviral only, antibiotic only, antiviral plus antibiotic, and no
    antiviral/antibiotic) and specific antivirals (acyclovir, amantadine, lopinavir-ritonavir,
    oseltamivir, rimantadine, and zanamivir) alone or combined with antibiotics; survival
    curves were created for general population, ambulatory, hospitalized, non-critical, and
    critical patients. Survival between groups receiving distinct treatments were compared
    through the Log-Rank test against patients not receiving antivirals/antibiotics. Cox
    regression models were applied for general population, ambulatory, hospitalized, non-
    critical, and critical patients to determine mortality risk in patients receiving any
    treatment compared to no antivirals/antibiotics (reference). Resulting hazard ratios (HR)
    were adjusted for demographic and clinical variables (sex, age, indigenous self-
    identification,            diabetes,           chronic         obstructive        pulmonary            disease        [COPD],

    abdominal pain, conjunctivitis, cyanosis, and sudden onset of symptoms) that were
    considered as risk factors in the univariate analysis for every group; all variables with
    P<.1 were included in the final model using the Enter method. To account for
    multicenter variability, adjusted risk was calculated through generalized estimating
    equations (GEE), setting the medical unit with the lowest CFR and the highest number
    of patients for every subgroup as the reference value. Further subgroup survival
    analyses and multivariable Cox regression models were applied for special populations
    (children and adolescents, pregnancy, puerperium, and non-pregnant/puerperal adults),
    VMI, and ICU. To quantify the minimal association strength of an unmeasured
    confounding factor that could reduce the risk conferred by exposures in our study, E-
    values were calculated for the point estimate and lower limit of the confidence interval.
    A two-sided P value <.05 was used to define statistical significance. Analyses and
    figures were created with SPSS software v.21 and GraphPad Prism v.8.0.1.
    Results
    No duplicated registries were found. After selection of eligible participants (Figure 1),
    136,855 patients from all 688 medical units were analyzed. 97.83% (n=133,887) were
    residents of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area, conformed by 17 municipalities of
    Mexico City (83.29%, n=111,768), and 60 municipalities (16.71%, n=22,119) of the
    State of Mexico. The remaining 2.17% (n=2,968) sought medical attention from all other
    30 states of the republic.
    Of all patients, 10.0% (n=13,743) received antibiotics only; 3.0% (n=4,044), antivirals

    More symptomatic ambulatory patients received antivirals and antibiotics more
    frequently (Supplementary Table 1); hospitalized patients with more signs/symptoms
    had greater use of antivirals, but less antibiotics (Supplementary Table 2).
    Baseline and follow-up characteristics of survivors (91.47%, n=136,855) and non-
    survivors (8.53%, n=11,679) are shown in Supplementary Table 3. Case-fatality rates
    (CFR)        in      special           populations        were:      8.92%        (95%CI:8.76-9.07%),               for      non-
    pregnant/puerperal adults; 1.72% (95%CI:0.66-2.77), pregnancy; 0.97% (95%CI:0-
    2.90), puerperium; and 0.69% (95%CI:0.48-0.90), children and adolescents. Of all
    deaths, 92.7% (95%CI:92.2-93.2) and 99.6% (95%CI:99.5-99.7) occurred by day 28
    and 56, respectively.
    Patients treated only with antivirals had a lower survival than those not receiving
    antivirals or antibiotics in the general population (Figure 2a), ambulatory (Figure 2b),
    hospitalized           (Figure          2c),    non-critical       (Figure      3a),     critical      (Figure     3c),       IMV
    (Supplementary Table 4), ICU (Supplementary Table 5) and non-pregnant/puerperal
    adults (Supplementary Table 6); for children and adolescents (Supplementary Table 7)
    and pregnancy (Supplementary Table 8) differences in survival were not significant, and
    there were not enough events for analysis in puerperal women. Increased survival with
    only antibiotics was observed in hospitalized, critical, and IMV, whereas decreased
    survival occurred in the general population, non-pregnant/puerperal adults, ambulatory,
    non-critical, ICU, and children and adolescents; there were no differences for
    pregnancy. Antivirals plus antibiotics resulted in decreased survival in the general
    population, ambulatory, non-critical, non-pregnant/puerperal adults, children and
                                                                                                                                     12

    adolescents, pregnancy, and ICU; increased survival, in hospitalized; and no
    differences, in critical and IMV groups.
    Decreased survival with oseltamivir was observed in the general population (Figure 2d),
    ambulatory (Figure 2e), non-critical (Figure 2d), ICU (Supplementary Table 5), non-
    pregnant/puerperal adults (Supplementary Table 6), children and adolescents
    (Supplementary Table 7), and pregnancy (Supplementary Table 8); no differences in
    survival occurred in hospitalized (Figure 2f), critical (Figure 3d), and IMV
    (Supplementary Table 4). Survival rates for amantadine, zanamivir, rimantadine,
    acyclovir, and lopinavir-ritonavir are shown in the same figures and tables as
    oseltamivir.
    Unadjusted (Supplementary Table 9) and adjusted (Table 2) risk of death for the
    general population, ambulatory, hospitalized, non-critical and critical patients, as well as
    for other subgroups (Supplementary Tables 10-14) were calculated. E-values for
    statistically significant risk groups are provided in Supplementary Tables 15-16. After
    adjusting for center through GEE, we found no significant variability in risk for the use of
    antivirals, antibiotics, or both in all groups; oseltamivir presented variability in
    hospitalized and critical patients, with the largest increases in risk occurring in public
    hospitals.
    Of all 8,969 patients receiving antivirals, 10% (n=903) had complete dates of initiation of
    antivirals; baseline and follow-up characteristics are available in Supplementary Table
    17. 25.2% (n=227) were admitted to hospital. Most patients (n=783) initiated antivirals
    before receiving medical attention in accredited units; 211 of those were hospitalized.
    Median time from symptom onset to initiation of antivirals was 1 day (IQR:0-4) for both

    ambulatory and hospitalized patients; time from symptom onset to ambulatory care in
    accredited units was 5 days (IQR:3-8) and 6 days (IQR:4-9) for hospitalization. Time
    from initiation of antivirals to hospitalization was 3 days (IQR:0-6). Time-to-initiation of
    antivirals and time-to-hospitalization for specific antivirals are shown in Supplementary
    Figure 1.
    Early (≤2 days) and late (>2 days) initiation of antivirals occurred in 64.2% (n=580) and
    35.8% (n=323) patients, respectively. Overall survival in early (91.3%) and late (88.9%)
    groups was not different (P=.2). Survival for early/late use of antivirals is shown in
    Supplementary Table 18. Oseltamivir was associated with increased risk of death in
    both early (HR=3.00, 95%CI:2.14-4.20) and late (HR=2.99, 95%CI:1.83-4.89) groups,
    as well as late use of lopinavir-ritonavir (HR=9.9, 95%CI:2.49-39.83); all other early/late
    antivirals did not reach statistical significance. There were no differences in
    hospitalization rates between early and late groups for every antiviral (Supplementary
    Figure 2).
    Discussion
    To our best knowledge, this is the first observational study evaluating amantadine,
    rimantadine, zanamivir, and acyclovir for COVID-19; no registered studies to evaluate
    these drugs exist (7). Only one study has evaluated risk of death for oseltamivir (25);
    lopinavir-ritonavir has been evaluated in clinical trials (26,27).
    We hypothesized that antivirals and antibiotics could be having widespread use in real-
    world settings. Therefore, we studied mortality in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
    patients treated with antivirals and/or antibiotics in Mexico City. Most patients were not
                                                                                                                                     14

    treated with antivirals or antibiotics (83.4%), although a substantial proportion received
    antivirals alone (3.0%) or combined with antibiotics (3.6%) despite national guidelines
    explicitly advising against antivirals out of clinical trials (12). Patients receiving antivirals
    and antibiotics were overall more symptomatic, suggesting that florid clinical
    presentations and not evidence may be guiding decision to treat, especially since
    evidence does not support antivirals included in our study: oseltamivir (n=8,414),
    amantadine (n=316), lopinavir-ritonavir (n=100), rimantadine (n=61), zanamivir (n=39),
    and acyclovir (n=31). Only one patient received remdesivir, the only antiviral to have
    shown some uncertain benefit for COVID-19 (28,29); physicians in low-to-middle
    income countries may be opting for low-cost repurposed medications before costly
    interventions for COVID-19.
    Of patients treated with antivirals, 10% had dates of initiation of antivirals. These
    patients received antivirals early after symptom onset (1 day, IQR:0-4) and well before
    seeking ambulatory (5 days, IQR:3-8) or hospital (6 days, IQR:4-9) care, which was
    expected since date of initiation of antivirals is only required to be registered for those
    treated before seeking medical care in accredited units. In Mexico antibiotics and most
    antivirals (i.e. oseltamivir, zanamivir, rimantadine) are sold under prescription. Private
    pharmacy-associated clinics are a rapidly growing sector in Mexico not included in our
    study where physicians tend to have lower experience, qualifications, compliance with
    regulations, and higher prescription rates, which could partially explain this (30-32).
    Self-medication with amantadine could be occurring since it is a widely available over-
    the-counter antiviral combined with antihistamines and acetaminophen.

    We studied the use of antivirals and antibiotics in patients with COVID-19 under
    conditions not commonly explored in COVID-19 studies since most tend to study
    hospitalized patients and adults, leaving important populations like children and
    adolescents, ambulatory patients, and pregnant women largely understudied (33,34).
    Our results show no benefit for the use of common antivirals for COVID-19 in the
    general population and every subgroup; increased risk of death was observed in certain
    groups. Hospitalization rates were not different when antivirals were used early (≤2
    days) vs late (>2 days).
    Oseltamivir was associated with increased mortality in the general population (HR=1.72,
    95%CI:1.61-1.84), ambulatory (HR=4.79, 95%CI:4.01-5.75), non-critical (HR=2.05,
    95%CI:1.88-2.23), and pregnant (HR=8.35, 95%CI:1.77-39.30) patients. Importantly,
    increased mortality was also observed in the cohort of 903 patients with both early
    (HR=3.00, 95%CI:2.14-4.20) and late (HR=2.99, 95%CI:1.83-4.89) use of oseltamivir.
    Antiviral drug-related heart damage is a concern since some antivirals may be
    cardiotoxic, aggravating myocardial damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 (35). It is unclear
    if cardiac adverse events after the use of neuraminidase inhibitors (i.e. oseltamivir,
    zanamivir) are increased or not due to high risk of bias of numerous influenza clinical
    trials; renal and psychiatric adverse events have higher occurrence with oseltamivir
    compared to placebo (36). Future studies should address if oseltamivir could be
    associated with cardiovascular and renal damage in COVID-19.
    Through molecular docking studies, oseltamivir had been hypothesized to inhibit viral
    proteases involved in the degradation of polyproteins that control viral replication (37).
    Nonetheless, this potentially inhibitory activity was found to be weak through molecular
                                                                                                                                     16

    modeling, while inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and reduction of symptoms in
    hospitalized patients failed (38). In one single-center study, oseltamivir was associated
    with decreased risk of death in COVID-19-hospitalized patients (HR=0.21; 95%CI:0.10-
    0.43) (25). Contrary to Liu et al., we found no benefit for oseltamivir in hospitalized
    patients (HR=1.07; 95%CI:0.99-1.15) which is consistent with studies of oseltamivir for
    SARS-CoV infection (HR=0.87; 95%CI:0.55-1.38) (39). Furthermore, combination of
    oseltamivir with antibiotics in hospitalized patients in our study resulted in decreased
    risk of death (HR=0.92; 95%:0.87-0.98), which could explain findings by Liu et al. since
    most patients in their cohort (87.7%) received antibiotics. Decreased mortality is most
    likely driven by antibiotics since hospitalized patients in our study receiving only
    antibiotics had lower risk of dying (HR=0.81, 95%CI:0.77-0.86) than antibiotics plus
    oseltamivir.
    In the RECOVERY study, there were no differences in mortality risk between
    hospitalized patients receiving lopinavir-ritonavir vs placebo (HR=1.03, 95%CI:0.91-
    1.17) (27), which is consistent with our finding of no benefit for lopinavir-ritonavir in
    hospitalized patients. Notably, ambulatory and late (>2 days) use of lopinavir-ritonavir
    was a risk factor for death.
    Paradoxically, antibiotics in the general population were a risk factor for death, but a
    protective factor in both ambulatory and hospitalized patients. Nonetheless, univariate
    models showed no overall effect of antibiotics in ambulatory patients; when adjusting
    only for demographic variables no effect persisted but was protective after adjusting
    only for clinical variables. This is explained by the fact that more symptomatic patients
                                                                                                                                     17

    received antibiotics more often. Supporting this conclusion, no benefit was observed for
    antibiotics in non-critical patients.
    We observed benefit for antibiotics in hospitalized, IMV, and critical patients, suggesting
    that increased survival could be due to prevention or treatment of concomitant bacterial
    infections, thereby supporting current WHO recommendations (11).
    For children and adolescents, antibiotics were a risk factor for death (HR=4.22,
    95%CI:2.01-8.86). However, we did not differentiate ambulatory from hospitalized
    pediatric patients and current recommendations include using antibiotics in hospitalized
    patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (40). The lack of benefit from
    antivirals included in our study in pediatric patients supports current guidelines
    discouraging their use after the expected large number of patients treated needed to
    observe differences in mortality in both non-severe and severe COVID-19 which would
    not outweigh risks (41).
    The main limitation of our study is that we were not able to assess cointerventions being
    studied for COVID-19 since only data for antivirals and antibiotics were available.
    Steroids have shown to increase survival in patients requiring oxygen administration
    and decrease survival in patients without supplementary oxygen (42,43). Under the
    assumption that treatment regimens tend to be similar by medical unit and hospital, we
    believe to have accounted for some of that variability by adjusting for center; lower risk
    for oseltamivir in hospitalized and critical patients receiving attention in private hospitals
    notwithstanding, increased risk of death with the use of oseltamivir occurred in most
    private and public hospitals. Furthermore, E-values aid the interpretation of our findings
                                                                                                                                     18

    by providing the estimated effect size that unmeasured factors in our study should have
    to reduce the reported risk to non-significant.
    Categorization of antibiotics as a single category in this dataset limits our study since
    we were not able to evaluate individual antibiotics proposed as candidate drugs for
    COVID-19, like azithromycin. However, in vitro studies (44) and clinical trials (45,46)
    have failed to support an effect of azithromycin against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, generalized
    effects for the use of antibiotics is plausible.
    Another potential limitation is that Mexico has a low diagnostic testing rate for SARS-
    CoV-2 (0.08 daily tests per 1,000 people) (47). However, health authorities require
    100% of patients with severe disease to be tested. Since we only studied mortality, an
    outcome expected to occur in patients who progress to severe disease, our study
    feasibly included most events. Nonetheless, excess mortality rates suggest there could
    be an undercounting of deaths in Mexico City (47). These patients could have refrained
    from seeking medical attention or received medical care in non-accredited COVID-19
    units where mortality, quality of care, and use of antivirals/antibiotics could be different.
    Also, the number of ICU beds in Mexico City was relatively low in March 2020 (6.0 per
    100,000 population) compared to most European countries (5 to 33.9 per 100,000) in
    the pre-pandemic period; this capacity was expanded to 29.5 ICU beds per 100,000 by
    September 2020 (48,49). Mortality rates, especially in patients younger than 60 years,
    are lower under high availability of ICU beds (48). Altogether, this means that mortality
    rates could have varied throughout our study period.
    Although we were not able to determine duration of follow-up in our study, the
    mechanisms and resources used by epidemiologic authorities in Mexico are robust
                                                                                                                                     19

    enough to guarantee adequate matching of patients who had completed follow-up with
    death certificates. Thus, our finding that 92.7% (95%CI:92.2-93.2) and 99.6%
    (95%CI:99.5-99.7) of deaths occurred by day 28 and 56, respectively, could be
    important for the interpretation and design of COVID-19 clinical trials assessing short-
    term mortality.
    In this study, we have obtained evidence to advise against the use of common antivirals
    (oseltamivir, zanamivir, amantadine, rimantadine, acyclovir, and lopinavir/ritonavir) for
    COVID-19 unless evidence from randomized controlled trials support their use in the
    future. Amantadine has been proposed as a candidate drug for COVID-19 (50), but our
    findings should discourage clinical trials to evaluate this drug.
    During the COVID-19 and influenza syndemic, rapid differentiation of the etiologic agent
    will be of utmost importance since clinicians will have to differentiate patients with
    influenza who may benefit from neuraminidase inhibitors from patients with COVID-19
    who may be harmed by them. Increasing vaccination rates against influenza will be a
    major challenge since only 20-30% of patients who presented with COVID-19 in our
    study had been vaccinated in the prior season. Mexican and international authorities
    should review treatment recommendations for patients with suspected viral respiratory
    disease since current guidelines recommend empiric use of oseltamivir before
    identification of the virus (13) or when coinfection exists (14).
    Conclusions
    Antivirals should be avoided for COVID-19 in the absence of evidence supporting their
    use. Oseltamivir was associated with increased mortality or no benefit in all groups.

    Antibiotics may increase survival in hospitalized and critical patients. Amidst the
    upcoming combined COVID-19-influenza season, vaccination history and rapid
    differentiation of the etiologic agent will be key to initiate or avoid antivirals.
