   Abstract
   Background
   Convalescent plasma, widely utilized in viral infections that induce neutralizing
   antibodies, has been proposed for COVID-19, and preliminary evidence shows that it
   might       have        beneficial         effect.      Our     objective     was       to compare epidemiological
   characteristics and outcomes between patients who received convalescent plasma for
   COVID-19 and those who did not, admitted to hospitals in Buenos Aires Province,
   Argentina, throughout the pandemic.
   Methods
   This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 2-month duration beginning on June
   1, 2020, including unselected, consecutive adult patients with diagnosed COVID-19,
   admitted to 215 hospitals with pneumonia. Epidemiological and clinical variables were
   registered in the Provincial Hospital Bed Management System. Convalescent plasma
   was supplied as part of a centralized, expanded access program.
   Results
   We analyzed 3,529 patients with pneumonia, predominantly male, aged 62±17, with
   arterial hypertension and diabetes as main comorbidities; 51.4% were admitted to the
   ward, 27.1% to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 21.7% to the ICU with mechanical
   ventilation requirement (ICU-MV). 28-day mortality was 34.9%; and was 26.3%, 30.1%
   and 61.4% for ward, ICU and ICU-MV patients. Convalescent plasma was administered
   to 868 patients (24.6%); their 28-day mortality was significantly lower (25.5% vs. 38.0%,
   p<0.001). No major adverse effects occurred.
   Logistic regression analysis identified age, ICU admission with and without MV
   requirement, diabetes and preexistent cardiovascular disease as independent predictors
                                                                                                                                       3

   of 28-day mortality, whereas convalescent plasma administration acted as a protective
   factor.
   Conclusions
   Our study suggests that the administration of convalescent plasma in COVID-19
   pneumonia admitted to the hospital might be associated with decreased mortality.

   EFFECT OF CONVALESCENT PLASMA ON MORTALITY IN PATIENTS WITH
   COVID-19 PNEUMONIA
   Introduction
   In December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the first cases of pneumonia caused by SARS-
   CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, were reported; the disease was subsequently named
   COVID-19. The new virus spread across the world relentlessly, and on March 11 the
   World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Up to now, COVID-19
   cases are approaching 30,000,000 with 935,000 dead [1,2].
   Few treatments have proven effective for COVID-19 [3]. The administration of
   convalescent plasma, widely utilized in viral infections that induce neutralizing
   antibodies, has also been proposed [4-6]. It was used during outbreaks of severe acute
   respiratory disease caused by other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, with
   varying results and when administered early, it decreased length of hospital stay [7-9].
   Convalescent plasma utilization has an acceptable safety profile and its administration
   constitutes a feasible approach to implement during a pandemic, even in low-resource
   settings. In COVID-19, it might reduce viral burden, improve clinical status, and
   decrease mortality [10-12]. On March 24, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration of the
   United States launched an Expanded Access Program to collect convalescent plasma
   donated by individuals who had recovered from COVID-19, and on August 23 approved
   emergency use [13]. A study conducted in 20,000 patients confirmed the safety of
   convalescent plasma and, thereafter, in a study of 30,000 patients, the same group of
   researchers demonstrated a decrease in mortality when convalescent plasma was
                                                                                                                                       5

   administered early in the course of COVID-19 [14-15].Convalescent plasma is currently
   being evaluated in 126 clinical trials [16].
   Early in the emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Health of the
   Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, created the Centralized Registry of Convalescent
   Plasma Donors (CROCPD-BA), with the aim of collecting, processing and distributing
   convalescent plasma, and issuing recommendations for its use in patients with COVID-
   19 [17]. Accordingly, the objective of the present study is to compare the epidemiological
   characteristics, outcomes and independent predictors of mortality among patients who
   received convalescent plasma and those who did not receive it, who were admitted to
   hospitals in Buenos Aires Province for COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.
   Methods
   This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted over 2 months, beginning
   on June 1, 2020, which included consecutive patients ≥18 years diagnosed with SARS
   CoV-2 with RT-PCR, admitted to hospitals with pneumonia. Data were obtained from the
   National Vigilance System (SNVS 2.0), the Provincial Hospital Bed Management
   System, and the CROCPD-BA.
   Collected variables were age, gender, comorbidities [18-19] (arterial hypertension,
   diabetes, preexistent cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
   immunodeficiency), requirement of mechanical ventilation, treatments, death or
   discharge, and convalescent plasma administration. Severe adverse events related to
   plasma infusion, as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-
   associated circulatory overload (TACO) were also recorded [20].
   Information about plasma collection and characteristics is available in the Supplement.

   The requirement of convalescent plasma was initiated by assistant physicians as part of
   a Program of Expanded Access [17]. The indications issued by the CROCPD-BA were
   presence of pneumonia, defined as of lung infiltrates, plus one of the following:
        -    Dyspnea with respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/minute
        -    Oxygen saturation ≤93%
        -    Oxygen requirement
        -    PaO2FIO2 <300 mmHg
        -    Increase in lung infiltrates >50% during the previous 24-48 hours
        -    Alteration in consciousness
        -    Multiple organ dysfunction
        -    Age >65 years
        -    Any of the above mentioned comorbidities
   All units of transfused convalescent plasma had an Ig-G antibody titer ≥1:400. The
   infused volume per unit was 200-250 ml.
   Initial severity of illness was assessed according to the site of admission: general ward,
   Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and ICU admission with requirement of mechanical ventilation
   (ICU-VM). The main outcome variable was 28-day mortality. Deaths due to COVID-19
   were confirmed on patient death certificates.
   Statistical analysis: Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation
   (SD) or median, [0.25-0.75] percentiles. Categorical variables were expressed as
   percentages.             Differences between survivors and nonsurvivors, and between patients
   who received plasma or not, were analyzed with chi-square, t, or Mann-Whitney U-tests,
   as appropriate.

   To identify independent predictors of 28-day mortality, variables differing between
   survivors and nonsurvivors with a p value <0.10 were entered into a multivariable
   regression model, using a forward stepwise analysis. Adjusted risks were expressed as
   odd ratios (OR) and confidence intervals of 95% [CI95%]
   Data were analyzed with SSPS-21 (Amonk, NY, US).
   A two-tailed p value <0.05 was considered significant.
   This study was approved by the Central Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health of
   Buenos Aires Province (Expedient 2020-14965594). The resolution 103/2017 of the
   Ministry of Health of the Province of Buenos Aires establishes the obligation of
   registration and accreditation of all the Institutional Ethics Committees at the Central
   Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health the Province of Buenos Aires; which is not
   associated with any institution or organization except the same Ministry, as it is the
   Ethics Committee of the said body, and evaluates all projects developed by institutions
   of the Ministry.
   In the protocol of the present study, the Central Ethics Committee acts as an Institutional
   Evaluation Committee in use of the powers provided for by Decree 3385/08 as a
   research project, in which the Ministry of Health of the Province of Buenos Aires acts
   both as sponsor and center.
   The Central Committee established that this observational study had an adequate risk-
   benefit ratio and requested the anonymization of data.
   The administration of convalescent plasma required signed consent from each patient or
   legal        representative,               according            to    CROCPD-BA                  regulations         (Expedient

   Results
   During the study period, 3,529 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to 215
   hospitals. Epidemiological data of the entire group and comparisons between survivors
   and nonsurvivors are shown in Table 1. Briefly, this was a predominantly male
   population, aged 62±17, with arterial hypertension and diabetes as main comorbidities.
   With respect to disease severity, 51.4% were admitted to the ward, 27.1% to the ICU
   without mechanical ventilation need, and 21.7% to the ICU, with mechanical ventilation
   requirement (ICU-MV).
   Twenty-eight-day mortality was 34.9% for the entire group; and respectively, for ward,
   ICU and ICU-MV patients was 26.3%, 30.1% and 61.4%. Survivors were significantly
   younger, had less comorbidities, lower admission to the ICU, and had received plasma
   more frequently.
   Convalescent plasma was administered to 868 patients (24.6%) (Table 2). Compared to
   the remaining 2,298, this group was composed of younger and predominantly male
   patients, with higher prevalence of arterial hypertension, diabetes, and higher ICU
   admission. The rate of mechanical ventilation use was similar in both groups.
   Twenty-eight-day unadjusted mortality was significantly lower in the entire group of
   patients receiving convalescent plasma, compared to those who had not (25.5% vs.
   38.0%; OR 0.59 [0.47-0.66], p<0.001); and also in patients in the ward (14.0% vs.
                                                                                                                                       9

   29.9%; OR 0.38 [0.28-0.52], p<0.001), and in the ICU-MV (50.0% vs. 65.0%; OR 0.54
   [0.38-0.75], p<0.001). Patients in the ICU without-MV had a trend to decreased mortality
   (26.1% vs. 31.8%; OR 0.76 [0.56-1.03], p=0.081).
   Logistic regression analysis identified age, ICU admission with and without MV, diabetes
   and preexistent cardiovascular disease as independent predictors of 28-day mortality,
   while convalescent plasma administration was associated with decreased mortality
   (Table 3).
   Discussion
   The main finding of our study was that the administration of convalescent plasma to
   patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with a decrease of 24.4% in
   adjusted mortality. This effect was consistent over all grades of severity on admission,
   although it was greater in less critical patients—those admitted to the general ward.
   In this study, the global mortality of 34.6% was higher than the 21-28% shown in
   observational studies [21-24] which can be ascribed to a different patient case-mix. The
   proportion of patients admitted to the ICU was 42.6%, of which 21.6% required
   mechanical ventilation on admission. These figures are notably higher than those
   reported by two studies from Spain (respectively for each: n=15,111 and 4,035, with
   ICU admission of 8.3% and 18%;and                                  mortality of 21% and 28%); United States
   (n=11,721, ICU admission of 19.9%, and mortality of 21.4%), and United Kingdom (n=
   20,133, ICU admission 16.8%, and mortality of 26%) [21-24].
   The efficacy of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 has been subject to much debate,
   due to the lack of a clinical trial with sufficient power to confirm it. For example, a study
                                                                                                                                      10

   carried out in Wuhan was prematurely terminated due to the end of the pandemic,
   although significant clinical improvement was observed in patients with severe disease
   [10]. Likewise, a study from The Netherlands was stopped because 79% of patients
   already had high titers of neutralizing antibodies before receiving convalescent plasma
   [25]. A recent clinical trial from India which excluded critically ill patients did not find any
   clinical benefit. However, these results might be ascribed to the absence of neutralizing
   antibodies or to titers lower than 1:80 in 27% and 45% of convalescent plasma units,
   respectively [26]. Moreover, 86% of patients in the plasma subgroup had detectable
   neutralizing antibodies on enrollment; so it is uncertain if the intervention would have
   been efficacious.
   Conversely, two small clinical trials demonstrated a significant decrease in mortality: in
   a study from Spain (n=81) including severely ill patients, mortality in the convalescent
   plasma subgroup was 0% vs. 9.3 % in the control, and in an Iraqi study (n =49), it was
   4.8% vs. 28.5%, respectively [27-28].
   Many observational studies support a probable efficacy of convalescent plasma. For
   example, a case-control study from China (including 138 cases and 1,568 controls)
   reported 2.2% mortality for the convalescent plasma subgroup, versus 4.1% for the
   control [29]. Furthermore, in a case-control study from the US including non-ventilated
   patients, 14-day mortality was 12.8% in the subgroup that had received convalescent
   plasma, vs. 24.4% in the control [30]. Similar results were reported in a matched case-
   control study, also from the US (136 cases, 251 controls), which showed lower mortality
   in patients receiving early administration of convalescent plasma with high titers of
   antibodies: 1.2% vs 8.9% [31]. Finally, the large case-series from the Mayo Clinic
                                                                                                                                      11

   (n=35,322) showed a relative risk of 30-day mortality of 0.77 [0.63-0.94] among patients
   transfused with plasma units of high antibody titers, compared to those transfused with
   low titers [15].
   Our study develops a different approach to this very relevant issue. We analyzed a
   cohort of 3,529 unselected, consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, of whom
   868 received convalescent plasma; its administration was evaluated as any other
   prognostic variable for mortality. We observed an independent, favorable effect on
   survival, and this is a novel finding. Although the nature of our study was observational,
   it was carried out using a robust database composed of observations prospectively
   collected, within the framework of a pre-established government program. Other
   independent predictors of mortality were age, diabetes and cardiovascular disease,
   similar to current literature on the topic [23,32-34].
   This effect of convalescent plasma was more pronounced in less severe patients —those
   admitted to the ward, suggesting the importance of timely administration. Even though
   age >65 was one inclusion criterion for receiving convalescent plasma, surprisingly,
   those who received it were, in fact, younger. We cannot discard selection bias of
   physicians prescribing a seemingly promising therapy to patients with greater chances
   of responding to it. Nevertheless, older age was an independent predictor of mortality,
   as expected [23,34]
   Limitations
   The main limitation of this study is the lack of randomized assignment of convales cent
   plasma administration. Additionally, unmeasured confounders might have influenced the
                                                                                                                                      12

   results, such as other risk factors or treatments. Since severity of illness on admission
   could not be evaluated with an established score, misclassification of patients might
   have occurred. However, the use of severity of illness on admission as a surrogate of
   acuity has already been utilized [3]. A more detailed analysis of the clinical variables
   collected could not be done, because of the type of data recorded in the register. Finally,
   the reason why assistant physicians chose not to administer convalescent plasma to
   patients with COVID-19 pneumonia fulfilling the inclusion criteria are unknown, but we
   speculate that some physicians might have felt uncomfortable with prescribing an
   experimental treatment to their patients.
   In conclusion, our study suggests that the administration of convalescent plasma in
   COVID-19 pneumonia might be associated with decreased mortality. Large, well-
   designed clinical trials are required to confirm these findings.
