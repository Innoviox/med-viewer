34     Abstract
35     Cross-reactive immune responses elicited by seasonal coronaviruses might impact SARS-CoV-2
36     susceptibility and disease outcomes. We measured neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 in
37     pre-pandemic sera from patients with prior PCR-confirmed seasonal coronavirus infection.
38     While neutralizing activity against seasonal coronaviruses was detected in nearly all sera, cross-
39     reactive neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 was undetectable.

42     Introduction
43     Since the initial description in December 2019 of a novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,
44     there has been a global effort to identify underlying the underlying causes for the great range of
45     disease severity observed, from mild or even asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory
46     distress and death. One hypothesis is that cross reactive immune responses, elicited by prior
47     infection with seasonal coronaviruses impacts the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, perhaps
48     providing a degree of protection against severe COVID-19 disease.
49
50     The endemic seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs)—HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-
51     NL63, and HCoV-229E—cause, mild or subclinical respiratory infections, with severe disease
52     being exceptionally rare [1]. Although there is low overall sequence homology between the
53     SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and those of the endemic HCoVs, overlapping T-cell epitopes
54     have been reported, particularly in the S2 subunit [2,3]. It is possible that neutralizing antibodies
55     induced by seasonal HCoV infection could cross-react with similar epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 S.
56     Such antibodies could potentially afford some level of protection against and perhaps contribute
57     to the wide range of outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To investigate this possibility, we
58     analyzed sera that had been collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic from patients with a
59     recent PCR-confirmed diagnosis of HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, or HCoV-229E infection. Such
60     samples should contain neutralizing antibodies against the respective seasonal HCoV, without
61     the possibility of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, allowing us to specifically test whether
62     antibodies elicited by seasonal HCoV infection can neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicate
63     a lack of SARS-CoV-2 cross-neutralization activity between the seasonal HCoVs and SARS-
64     CoV-2.

66     Methods
67     Identification of Patient Samples: The thirty-seven prepandemic serum samples selected for
68     inclusion in this study were all collected as part of routine clinical care prior to 2020 from
69     patients in Edinburgh, Scotland, effectively excluding the possibility of prior SARS-CoV-2
70     infection. All samples were from symptomatic inpatients with PCR-confirmed diagnosis of
71     HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, or HCoV-229E infection, 11-291 days prior to collection of the
72     serum sample. Ten positive control COVID-19 serum samples were collected in April-May 2020
73     from patients with mildly symptomatic, PCR-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 24-61 days
74     prior to serum collection. All samples were anonymized and ethical approval to utilize these
75     patient samples was obtained through the NHS Lothian BioResource and the Rockefeller
76     University IRB
77
78     Viruses: The seasonal coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 (ATCC VR-759) and HCoV-229E (ATCC
79     VR-740) were obtained from Zeptometrix, and HCoV-NL63 (Amsterdam I) was obtained from
80     BEI resources. Viral stocks were generated by propagation on Huh7.5 cells. The replication-
81     competent chimeric recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding SARS-CoV-2 Spike and
82     GFP (rVSV/SARS-2/GFP2E1) has been described previously and was propagated on
83     293T/ACE2cl.22 cells [4].
84
85     Neutralization assays: Sera were initially diluted 1:12.5, and then serially diluted 5-fold over 7
86     dilutions in 96 well plates. Thereafter, approximately 4x103 infectious units of either
87     rVSV/SARS-2/GFP, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, or HCoV-229E were mixed with the serum

 88     dilutions and incubated at 37oC for 1 hour. Virus serum mixtures were subsequently transferred
 89     to 96-well plates containing 1x104 293T/ACE2cl.22 (for rVSV/SARS-2/GFP and HCoV-OC43)
 90     or HT1080/ACE2cl.14 (for HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E) target cells/well. Infection was
 91     allowed to proceed for 16 hours (rVSV/SARS-2) or 24 hours (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63,
 92     HCoV-229E). The numbers of rVSV/SARS-2/GFP was assessed by flow cytometric detection of
 93     GFP expression as described previously [4]. For HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E,
 94     cells were trypsinized and immunostained to detect nucleoprotein antigen expression in infected
 95     cells. For HCoV-OC43, Sigma MAB9013 was used, for HCoV-NL63, Eurofins
 96     M.30.HCo.B2D4 was used, for HCoV-229E: Eurofins M.30.HCo.B1E7 was used. A secondary
 97     antibody conjugate Alexa Fluor® 488 Goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (Thermo) was then used to
 98     and infected cells enumerated by flow cytometry.
 99
100     Data analysis: All flow cytometry data was analyzed using FlowJo software version 10.6.1. All
101     graphs and corresponding NT50 values were generated using GraphPad Prism version 8.
102
103     Results
104     To assess whether prior infection by seasonal coronaviruses could elicit antibodies with
105     neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2, we identified 37 serum samples collected prior to
106     the COVID19 pandemic from patients who were diagnosed using PCR with a seasonal
107     coronavirus 11-291 days (median 80 = days) prior to serum sample collection. Of these 20 were
108     diagnosed with HCoV-OC43 infection, 10 were diagnosed with HCoV-NL63 infection and 7
109     were diagnosed with HCoV-229E infection. We also developed flow cytometry-based
110     coronavirus neutralization assays based on the detection of nucleocapsid expression in HCoV-

111     OC43, HCoV-NL63, or HCoV-229E infected cells. Using theses neutralization assays, we
112     confirmed that neutralizing antibodies targeting the seasonal coronaviruses were present in the
113     pre-pandemic samples. Indeed, all sera from individuals diagnosed with recent infection by a
114     seasonal coronavirus neutralized that same virus. Nevertheless, the neutralization titers varied
115     between viruses. For example, while samples collected from HCoV-OC43 infected individuals
116     typically exhibited potent neutralization of HCoV-OC43, sera collected from HCoV-229E
117     infected individuals had comparatively weak neutralization activity against HCoV-229E. Most
118     sera exhibited neutralizing activity against multiple seasonal coronaviruses. Indeed, some
119     samples collected individuals with recent HCoV-229E infection neutralized HCoV-OC43 with
120     higher titers than HCoV-229E. Collectively, 73% of samples had an NT50 > 500 for HCoV-
121     OC43 and while 57% of samples NT50 > 500 for HCoV-229E, regardless of the virus detected at
122     the time of sample collection. Neutralizing activity against HCoV-NL63 was typically of lower
123     titer. Nevertheless all but one serum sample from individuals with recently diagnosed HCoV-
124     NL63 infection had neutralizing activity against HCoV-NL63 with NT50 values of >1:50.
125     Overall, this collection of serum samples had extensive neutralizing activity against several
126     seasonal coronaviruses including, particularly, the betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43, that is the most
127     closely related to SARS-CoV-2 of the viruses tested. Indeed, some of the sera had potent
128     neutralizing activity against HCoV-OC43 with NT50 values in excess of 10,000.
129
130     In contrast, none of the very same 37 serum samples tested had any detectable neutralization
131     activity against rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP. Importantly, rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP is at least as,
132     or more, sensitive to neutralization by COVID-19 plasma analysis as SARS-CoV-2 [4]. Indeed,
133     sera collected from ten individuals with recently diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection could

134     neutralize rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP with NT50 values ranging from 96 to 5400. Overall these
135     data strongly suggest that only pandemic sera, and not pre-pandemic sera have neutralizing
136     activity against SARS-CoV-2, and further suggest that pre-existing serological immunity to
137     seasonal coronaviruses is not a major driver of the diverse outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
138
139     Discussion
140     These data demonstrate that neutralization activity against seasonal coronaviruses is nearly
141     ubiquitous in sera collected from individuals with PCR-confirmed pre-pandemic seasonal
142     coronavirus infection. Indeed, most sera had neutralizing activity against multiple seasonal
143     coronaviruses and some sera had greater neutralization potency against different coronaviruses
144     than the one detected at the time of sample collection. This may be due to inherent differences in
145     neutralization sensitivity among the seasonal coronaviruses, and is most likely the result of prior,
146     undocumented infection with different seasonal coronaviruses. That we observed more potent
147     antibody responses to HCoV-OC43 and regardless of PCR result may suggest recent infection
148     with this virus is more common, which is in line with previous observations suggesting that
149     reinfection with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E occurs at a greater frequency than HCoV-
150     NL63[5–8] and that infection with HCoV-OC43 is common this geographic locale.
151     While we cannot exclude the possibility that that seasonal coronavirus elicit cross-neutralizing
152     antibodies, the divergence between seasonal coronaviruses S proteins would suggest limited
153     cross reactivity (HCoV-OC43 S shares 22.6 and 24.5% identical amino acids with and HCoV-
154     229E and HCoV-NL63 S respectively, while HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E S share 55%
155     identical amino acids) Accordingly, none of the samples tested had any neutralization activity
156     against SARS-CoV-2 whose spike protein shares 24%-29% amino acid identity with the seasonal

157     coronaviruses. In agreement with the notion that there is little cross reactivity between seasonal
158     HCoV neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2, many of the monoclonal antibodies cloned
159     from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals contain very low levels of somatic hypermutation [9],
160     suggesting that they arise from de novo rather than recall B-cell responses. However, instances of
161     cross-reactive antibodies with high levels of somatic hypermutation have been reported,
162     indicating that in some cases memory B cells evoked by prior seasonal HCoV infection may be
163     recalled during infection with a SARS-like coronavirus [10].
164     While other groups have reported the existence of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive neutralizing
165     antibodies in sera from individuals that were not infected SARS-CoV-2 , the neutralization
166     activity observed appears low [11,12]. Unlike other reports the pre-pandemic sera used in our
167     study that have undetectable neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 can neutralize seasonal
168     HCoVs, in some cases quite potently. While it is possible that there are rare instances of
169     individuals possessing antibodies from prior seasonal HCoV infection may be able to also target
170     SARS-CoV-2 S, our data argues against a broad role for pre-existing protective humoral
171     immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
