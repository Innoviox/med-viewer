17     Abstract
18     Chronic inflammation might contribute to the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
19     the relationship between serum immunoglobulins and risk of ALS remains however unclear. In order
20     to overcome limitations like reverse causation and residual confounding commonly seen in the
21     observational studies, we applied molecular epidemiological analyses to examine the polygenic and
22     causal associations between serum immunoglobulins and ALS. Summary statistics from the large-
23     scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) among European ancestry populations (~15000
24     individuals for serum immunoglobulins, and more than 36000 individuals for ALS) were accessed
25     from different consortia. The relationships between three types of serum immunoglobulins (IgA,
26     IgM, and IgG) and ALS were investigated in a discovery phase and then in a replication phase.
27     Polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis was performed with PRSice package to test the polygenic
28     association, and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed with TwoSampleMR
29     package to infer the causality. An inverse polygenic association was discovered between IgA and
30     ALS as well as between IgM and ALS. Such associations were however not replicated using a larger
31     GWAS of ALS, and no causal association was observed for either IgA-ALS or IgM-ALS. A positive
32     polygenic association was both discovered [odds ratio (OR) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI):
33     1.12-1.25, P=5.9×10-7] and replicated (OR=1.13, 95% CI: 1.06-1.20, P=0.001) between IgG and
34     ALS. A causal association between IgG and ALS was also suggested in both the discovery
35     (OR=1.06, 95%CI: 1.02-1.10, P=0.009) and replication (OR=1.07, 95%CI: 0.90-1.24, P=0.420)
36     analyses, although the latter was not statistically significant. This study suggests a shared polygenic
37     risk between serum IgG (as a biomarker for chronic inflammation) and ALS.

43     Introduction
44     Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relatively rare but fatal neurodegenerative disease. Chronic
45     inflammation and altered immune responses have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis
46     of ALS [1]. The relationship between serum immunoglobulins, as known biomarkers for
47     inflammation and immune responses, and risk of ALS remains however unclear. In a previous study
48     [2], we did not find a statistically significant positive association between immunoglobulin G (IgG)
49     and risk of ALS [hazard ratio=1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89-1.22; per 2.99 g/L increase
50     of IgG]. In the same study, we also found that during the 20 years before diagnosis, patients with
51     ALS had more rapidly declining levels of IgG compared to others. We speculate that the noted lack
52     of association between IgG and ALS might be attributable to both a real positive association
53     between IgG and ALS (i.e., higher levels of IgG lead to higher risk of ALS) and reverse causation
54     (i.e., ALS results in declined levels of IgG). In addition to reverse causation, observational studies
55     are also prone to other systemic errors, which collectively make it often difficult to infer causality
56     for associations noted in observational studies [3].
57
58     By using the summary statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS),
59     polygenic risk score (PRS) and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses have added novel evidence
60     to support polygenic and causal relationships between several traits and ALS, corroborating
61     importantly findings from previous observational studies [4-6]. In this study, we used GWAS
62     summary statistics to assess the associations of genetically predicted levels of immunoglobulins with
63     the genetically predicted risk of ALS, and to test whether such associations are causal. Since IgG is a
64     biomarker for chronic inflammation, we hypothesized that there is a positive and causal relationship
65     between IgG and ALS. We additionally studied another two serum immunoglobulins (IgA and IgM,
66     two biomarkers that have rarely been studied in ALS) to assess the specificity of the IgG result.

69     Methods
70     Summary statistics
71     We used publicly available summary statistics of several GWAS within the European ancestry
72     population in this study. GWAS of serum immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, and IgG) were conducted
73     among ~15000 individuals (from Iceland and Sweden), from which single nucleotide

 74     polymorphisms (SNPs) with the association P-values <1.0×10-6 were available [7]. GWAS summary
 75     statistics of ALS were obtained from two studies (available in the IEU GWAS database;
 76     https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk, ID for ALS_2016: ieu-a-1085; ID for ALS_2018: ebi-a-GCST005647). In
 77     the discovery analysis, summary statistics of ALS (ALS_2016) were obtained from a GWAS
 78     performed among 36052 individuals (including 12577 patients with ALS and 23475 controls) by the
 79     Project MinE group [8]. In the replication analysis, summary statistics of ALS (ALS_2018) were
 80     obtained from a meta-analysis incorporating the results from ALS_2016 and another GWAS
 81     including 40598 individuals (8229 patients with ALS and 32369 controls) [9]. Because we only used
 82     GWAS summary statistics rather than individual-level data in this study, participant inform consent
 83     and ethical review permit were waived according to the ethical review board of Shenzhen Baoan
 84     Women's and Children's Hospital.
 85
 86     Using IgA, IgM, and IgG as the exposures (base traits) and ALS as the outcome (target trait), the
 87     polygenic and causal associations of six exposure-outcome pairs (three in the discovery analysis and
 88     three in the replication analysis) were investigated by PRS and MR analyses, respectively. Because
 89     the values of immunoglobulins were standardized in the GWAS, we estimated accordingly odds
 90     ratio (OR) per standard deviation of genetically predicted level for each type of immunoglobulin in
 91     the present study.
 92
 93     PRS analyses
 94     Polygenic associations were investigated by PRS analyses in Linux with PRSice package (version
 95     1.25) [10]. For the summary statistics of each exposure, correlated SNPs were pruned by linkage
 96     disequilibrium (LD) clumping with default parameter settings. Genotypes of the HapMap_ceu_all
 97     (release 22, 60 individuals, 3.96 million SNPs) were used as the reference panel, clumping threshold
 98     p1=p2=0.5, LD threshold r2=0.05, and the distance threshold of 300Kb. Independent SNPs were then
 99     extracted and included in 100000 quantiles with gradually increasing P-value thresholds (PT, ranging
100     from 0 to 1.0×10-6, in steps of 1.0×10-11 per quantile). The PT of the quantile that explained the
101     largest variance of the target was defined as the best-fitted PT.

104     Utilizing the instrumental variable (IV) methods (Fig. 1), MR analyses were performed in R (version
105     3.6.1) with TwoSampleMR package (version 0.5.2) [11]. Causal inference by MR analysis requires
106     three basic assumptions: 1) relevance, i.e., IVs have causal effects on the exposure (e.g., IgG); 2)
107     exclusion restriction, i.e., IVs affect the outcome (e.g., ALS), only through the exposure; and 3)
108     exchangeability or independence, i.e., no common causes exist between IVs and the outcome [12].
109     Lead SNPs from the genetic loci reported to be associated with each exposure were extracted from
110     the GWAS of immunoglobulins [7]. The associations of the SNPs with other traits (associations with
111     a P-value <5×10-8) were checked in GWAS Catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas) and excluded,
112     leaving independent lead SNPs after LD clumping as the IVs (Additional file: Table S1). The causal
113     relationship of each exposure-outcome pair was primarily examined by the inverse variance
114     weighted (IVW) method and complemented with another four methods (MR Egger regression,
115     weighted median, simple and weighted mode) as sensitivity analyses.

118     Results and discussion
119     Inverse polygenic associations were discovered for IgA-ALS and IgM-ALS, neither of the
120     associations was however replicated (Table 1, Additional file: Figs. 1-2). A positive polygenic
121     association between IgG and ALS was found both in the discovery and replication analyses (Table 1,
122     Additional file: Fig. 3). The OR was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.12-1.25, P=5.9×10-7) in the discovery analysis
123     and 1.13 (95%CI: 1.06-1.20, P=0.001) in the replication analysis.
124
125     In the MR analyses, causal association was not found for either IgA-ALS or IgM-ALS (Table 2),
126     regardless of the use of MR methods (Additional file: Figs. 4-5 and Table S2). For IgG-ALS (Table
127     2, Additional file: Fig. 6), a statistically significant causal association was found in the discovery
128     analysis (OR=1.06, 95% CI: 1.02-1.10, P=0.009). A causal positive association was also suggested
129     in the replication analysis, although not statistically significant (OR=1.07, 95%CI: 0.90-1.24,
130     P=0.420).
131
132     Utilizing PRS and MR analyses of large-scale GWAS of immunoglobulins and ALS, we provided
133     new evidence supporting a potentially causal positive association between IgG, but not IgA or IgM,
134     and risk of ALS.

136     Accumulating evidence supports that inflammation and altered immune responses are involved in
137     the different phases of ALS [13]. Physiological barriers (e.g., blood-brain barrier) and innate
138     immunity cells (e.g., macrophages) are fundamental in the maintenance and modulation of the
139     central nervous system, whereas chronic inflammation might lead to dysfunction of the neurons [14].
140     B cells play important roles in adaptive immunity, through producing immunoglobulins and
141     presenting antigens to T cells [15]. IgA constitutes 10-20% of serum immunoglobulins and is mainly
142     involved in the mucosal immune response. IgM constitutes 5-10% of serum immunoglobulins and is
143     the earliest released antibody during adaptive immune response. IgG constitutes ~75% of serum
144     immunoglobulins and can be transmitted through placental and blood-brain barriers [16].
145
146     Several studies have indicated a link between IgG and ALS. Deposit of IgG has been found in the
147     spinal cord and motor cortex of some ALS patients [17]. Prevalence of serum monoclonal
148     immunoglobulins (60%, including 44% IgG and 16% IgM) was found to be higher among ALS
149     patients than that of the control group (13%) [18]. High levels of 20 IgG antibodies were also found
150     to be help diagnose ALS cases [19]. In our previous cohort study including more than half a million
151     participants with >20 years of follow-up, we found that per 2.99 g/L increase of IgG levels in blood,
152     there was a 4% increased risk of ALS, although the association was not statistically significant [2].
153     The lack of statistical significance might be multifactorial, including first a potentially real positive
154     association between IgG and ALS risk, a lack of statistical power due to the relatively small number
155     of ALS cases identified (N=152), and also reverse causation (i.e., patients with ALS had more
156     rapidly declining IgG levels, compared to individuals not developing ALS, during the 20 years
157     before ALS diagnosis). However, because genotypes are determined at birth and unchangeable
158     during the life course, our results about a potentially causal relationship between genetically
159     predicted IgG level and genetically predicted ALS risk are unlikely to be dependent on early or late
160     stage of ALS.
161
162     By using summary statistics from several large-scale GWAS, in the present study, we identified a
163     statistically significant positive polygenic association between IgG and ALS in both the discovery
164     and replication analyses. The association is further suggested to be causal in the MR analysis.
165     Although statistically significant result was only obtained in the discovery analysis, similar point

166     estimate was noted in the replication analysis. The differences between the discovery (ALS_2016)
167     and replication (ALS_2018) samples might have contributed to the lack of statistical significance in
168     the replication analysis. For instance, in the discovery GWAS (ALS_2016), patients with ALS and
169     controls were matched for age, sex, and geographic regions, whereas more than 50% of participants
170     in the replication GWAS (ALS_2018) were only matched for race/ethnicity.
171
172     In contrast to IgG, no clear polygenic association nor causal relationship was noted for IgA-ALS and
173     IgM-ALS. A recent observational study, including 489 patients with ALS and 17475 neurologically
174     healthy controls, also failed to detect an association between total serum IgA and ALS [20]. The
175     different result pattern between IgA, IgM and IgG might be partly explained by the fact that IgG is a
176     biomarker for chronic inflammation and bypasses the blood-brain-barrier, which might be more
177     relevant for neurodegenerative diseases including ALS, compared to the other immunoglobulins [21].
178
179     Even though we used the latest and largest GWAS of immunoglobulins, only two independent SNPs
180     could be selected as IVs for IgG. As a result, we could only use IVW methods in the MR analysis.
181     According to the current GWAS Catalog, no genome-wide significant association was identified
182     between the two IVs of IgG and other non-ALS traits. Interestingly, the two genes near these two
183     IVs are both biologically related to immune responses, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration.
184     Genetic variant rs7554873 is close to the FCGR2B (Fc fragment of IgG receptor IIb) gene on
185     chromosome 1. Protein FcγRIIB encoded by FCGR2B gene is a low-affinity receptor for the Fc
186     region of IgG. FcγRIIB involves in the regulation of antibodies produced by B-cells and in the
187     phagocytosis of immune complexes, it is also reported to mediate the inhibitory effect of aggregated
188     α-synuclein on microglial phagocytosis [22]. Genetic variant rs2133037 is close to the HLA-DQB1
189     (major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 1) gene on chromosome 6. Its encoded protein
190     HLA-DQB1 is also reported to be associated with immunity and neuronal survival [23].
191
192     In this study, we had only access to GWAS summary statistics data when testing the polygenic and
193     causal relationship between serum immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG) and ALS. Using a Mendelian
194     randomization analysis, our study is less prone to methodological limitations commonly seen in
195     observational studies such as confounding and reverse causation. Future studies with individual
196     genotype data are warranted in further understanding the roles of other factors (such as age, sex,

197     ethnicity, etc.) in the link between different immunoglobulins (especially IgG) and ALS. Further, to
198     test whether chronic inflammation is indeed a mechanism linking together IgG and ALS, the role of
199     IgG on other diseases (both diseases with a known link with chronic inflammation and diseases
200     without such a link) needs to be studied. Finally, as high levels of IgG antibodies were suggested to
201     improve the diagnosis of ALS [19], the potential use of IgG measurement in clinical diagnosis of
202     ALS needs to be further examined.
203
204
205     Conclusions
206     In conclusion, our study suggests a shared polygenic risk between serum IgG and ALS. The
207     causality between IgG and ALS needs to be further validated when more instrumental variables are
208     available and when different methods of causal inference are possible to use.

307     Figure 1. Illustration of the Mendelian randomization analysis
308     Mendelian randomization analysis utilizes the instrumental variable (IV) methods to infer the
309     causality between exposure and outcome. Because alleles are randomly assigned during mitosis,
310     restricted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could be used as instrumental variables to test the
311     causal effect of exposure on the outcome. ALS: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
