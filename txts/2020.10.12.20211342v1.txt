  Abstract
  Introduction: Numerous scientific journal articles have been rapidly published related to
  COVID-19 making navigation and understanding of relationships difficult.
  Methods: A graph network was constructed from the publicly available CORD-19 database of
  COVID-19-related publications using an engine leveraging medical knowledgebases to identify
  discrete medical concepts and an open source tool (Gephi) used to visualise the network.
  Results: The network shows connections between disease, medication and procedures
  identified from title and abstracts of 195,958 COVID-19 related publications (CORD-19
  Dataset). Connections between terms with few publications, those unconnected to the main
  network and those irrelevant were not displayed. Nodes were coloured by knowledgebase
  and node size related to the number of publications containing the term. The dataset and
  visualisations made publicly accessible via a webtool.
  Conclusion: Knowledge management approaches (text mining and graph networks) can
  effectively allow rapid navigation and exploration of entity interrelationships to improve
  understanding of diseases such as COVID-19.

  Introduction
  There is urgency to accelerate research that can help contain the spread of the COVID-19
  epidemic; to ensure that those affected are promptly diagnosed and receive optimal care,
  and to support research priorities in a way that leads to the development of global research
  platforms in preparation for the next disease epidemic; thus, allowing for accelerated
  research, R&D for diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines and their timely access. In view of
  the urgency of this outbreak, the international community is mobilising to find ways to
  significantly accelerate the development of interventions.[1] Experts have identified key
  knowledge gaps and research priorities and shared scientific data on ongoing research,
  thereby accelerating the generation of critical scientific information to contribute to control
  the COVID 19 emergency.[2]
  However, the pace and volume of research means that it is hard to stay up to date with the
  growing body of new scientific papers about the disease and the novel coronavirus that
  causes it. To mitigate this, many organisations are hosting digital collections holding
  thousands of freely available papers that can help researchers quickly find the information
  they seek. By one estimate, the COVID-19 literature published since January has reached
  more than 200,000 papers and is doubling every 30 days; among the biggest episodes of
  disease specific publication of scientific literature ever.[3]
  One approach to navigating and searching such knowledge collections is through graph
  databases, which represent the connections between the semantic concepts with nodes,
  edges and other properties of the data. This allows semantic queries to search across the
  dataset to find relationships between papers on any set of data points. Such a graph displayed
  in a visualization tool gives an interactive overview of the nodes and connections between
  the concepts across the papers and allows one to move around and focus on what is
  interesting to the researcher.[4]
  The aim of this short report is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a network graph
  approach for rapid navigation of the COVID-19 literature in a publicly available format and to
  present an openly available tool for exploring a COVID-19 knowledge dataset.
  Methods
  The CORD-19 data set is a rapidly increasing open source collection of scholarly articles
  related to the corona virus.[5] As of the date August 8, 2020, the dataset consists of 207,311
  papers from over 16,0000 sources. Articles available include title, abstract, authors, source,
  publication date, and in some cases full text.[6]
  We used a proprietary natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) engine
  that leverages the approach of heuristic segmentation (a fast heuristic search algorithm) and
  a knowledge-driven approach for concept identification, context determination, inferencing
  and extraction of corresponding values and units. The engine works with domain specific
  knowledgebases of clinical terms, concepts and rules that are tailored to the data to be
  extracted.[7]
                                                                    3

  In this study, we used a collection of ten knowledgebases consisting of a core knowledgebase
  and nine domain specific knowledgebases that were built using UMLS terms and updated with
  recently added terms specific to COVID-19: Core Oncology knowledgebase,Pharmacological
  substance (medications) (T121), Virus (T005), Therapeutic or preventative procedure (T061).
  Sign or symptom (T184), Disease or syndrome (T047), Gene or genome (T028), Immunologic
  factor (T129), Finding (T033), Body part, organ or organ component (T023).[8]
  The title and abstract sections of all papers in the CORD-19 dataset were processed against
  the various knowledge sources to extract discrete data from each paper and stored in a
  database. Along with the discrete data, the following metadata was also stored: Cord uid (the
  unique identifier), Title, Abstract, Body text, Publication date, URL, Authors, Journal, KB –
  which of the 10 available knowledge sources was used to extract this term, Term category or
  question; ie: medication, virus, symptom, Paper Id – id of the paper in the CORD-19 dataset
  from which the term was extracted, Source section – either title or abstract. Generic terms
  were determined to have little significance for example, “Air”, “Water”, “Virus” and these
  were removed from the set of extracted concepts.
  Networks created with the entire set of results and all the knowledge sources are very large
  with too many terms to visualize details in the data. For this reason, a subset of the data was
  selected to enable meaningful visual exploration by selecting a subset of the knowledge
  sources, paper sections and publication year for each network based on specific medical
  themes, e.g. treatments, cardiology etc. Duplicate terms (same term found in multiple
  knowledge sources) were consolidated to remove redundant data. For example, “obesity” is
  included in both the “Symptoms and Side Effects” and the “Disease or Syndrome” knowledge
  sources.
  For each term found in a paper, a link was created to every other term in the same paper. The
  culmination of these links for all papers resulted in the network structure where the weight
  of a connection between any two terms was determined by the number of papers linking the
  terms. Additional filtering was performed to refine the scope of the network and removal of
  noise; links with low weights were removed, as were links with terms that were disconnected
  from the rest of the network.
  The open-source software tool Gephi was used to create a visualisation of the network using
  the collections of terms and connections that made up the network structure.[9] Network
  nodes were coloured based on the knowledge source, node sizes are proportional to the
  frequency of each term, the connection weight (edge thickness) was based on the number of
  associated papers. The networks were exported and visualised in an HTML website using the
  Sigma JS JavaScript library.
  Results
  A total of 207,311 publications from the CORD-19 dataset were processed using the NLP
  engine. In total 3,357,328 total entities were extracted from 195,958 of these papers
  consisting of 44,494 unique terms. Four network graphs were generated using this extracted
  data: Cardiological Diseases, Lung Diseases, Title Network, Treatment Network.(Figure;
  https://nlp.inspirata.com/networkvisualisations/treatmentnetwork/#). The filters applied to
                                                                    4

  Discussion
  Recently there have been several initiatives to explore knowledge graphs in medical data and
  with some applied to aspects of COVID-19 associated published literature.[10,11] This study
  has demonstrated the feasibility of using a graph database approach to create a targeted
  concept association networks as an interactive way to allow users to easily navigate the
  rapidly growing COVID-19 related literature, and particularly as a way of understanding and
  exploring the relationships between the key concepts within this corpus of literature articles.
  This approach is applicable to any collection of scientific literature such as PubMed or Clinical
  Trials.gov, or proprietary document management systems. Specific lexical terms and
  knowledge sources can be utilized from the UMLS collection or other publicly available
  sources and imported for use with NLP/AI Engines.
  One constraint is that the network size increases as more knowledge sources are added. As
  a consequence, methods for pruning the network to enable visual exploration are required.
  As the density of the network increased it becomes more difficult to interactively explore
  without a-priori knowledge of the specific knowledge sources. Another limitation is that the
  network only shows the first level connections or the direct connection between papers and
  concepts. It does not find connections between concepts that span several papers – although
  this can be achieved by traversing the network visually.
  We addressed these limitations of network size and the search for deep connections by
  implementing a breadth-first search on the network structure. The search is efficient and can
  be applied across very large networks, even when all the knowledge sources are used
  simultaneously. This approach can find the shortest path connections (the trail of papers)
  between any concepts.
  This study has demonstrated that an approach using graph databases and network analysis
  can be developed rapidly and is a useful approach for understanding large volumes of medical
  literature, quickly grasping the current state of our knowledge, and discovering previously
  unknown or unnoticed relationships between emerging medical concepts. The unusual
  circumstances of a global pandemic have given rise to assembly of an unprecedented volume
  of medical literature and this work demonstrates a powerful approach to condensing the
  literature into insights that help us fight this disease. Further development of this approach
  will enable ongoing analysis and deep searching of large collections of literature, such as
  PubMed, and application to other disease areas, as well as for target or biomarker
  discovery.[12–14]
