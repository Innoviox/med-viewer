          ABSTRACT
          Purpose: Several studies have reported adopting prone positioning (PP) in non-intubated patients with
          COVID-19-related hypoxaemic respiratory failure. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated
          the impact of PP on oxygenation and clinical outcomes.
          Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase and COVID-19 living systematic review from December1st
          2019 to July23rd 2020. We included studies that reported using PP in hypoxaemic, non-intubated adult
          COVID-19 patients. Primary outcome measure was the weighted mean difference (MD) in oxygenation
          parameters (PaO2/FiO2, PaO2 or SpO2) pre and post-PP.
          Results: Fifteen single arm observational studies reporting PP in 449 patients were included. Substantial
          heterogeneity was noted in terms of, location within hospital where PP was instituted, respiratory
          supports, frequency and duration of PP. Significant improvement in oxygenation was reported post-PP:
          PaO2/FiO2, (MD 37.6, 95%CI 18.8, 56.5); PaO2, , (MD 30.4 mmHg, 95%CI 10.9, 49.9); and SpO2, (MD
          5.8%, 95%CI 3.7, 7.9). Patients with a pre-PP PaO2/FiO2 ≤150 experienced greater oxygenation
          improvements compared with those with a pre-PP PaO2/FiO2 >150 (MD 40.5, 95%CI -3.5, 84.6) vs. 37,
          95%CI 17.1, 56.9). Respiratory rate decreased post-PP (MD -2.9, 95%CI -5.4, -0.4). Overall intubation
          and mortality rates were 21% (90/426) and 26% (101/390) respectively. No major adverse events were
          reported.
          Conclusions: Despite significant variability in frequency and duration of PP and respiratory supports, PP
          was associated with improvements in oxygenation parameters without any reported serious adverse
          events. Major limitation being lack of control arm and adjustment for confounders. Clinical trials are
          required to determine the effect of awake PP on patient-centred outcomes.

          What is the key question?
          Is the novel approach of prone positioning in non- intubated patients associated with improvement in
          oxygenation?
          What is the bottom line?
          Prone position in non-intubated severe COIVD 19 suffers is associated with improvement of oxygenation
          while the short- and long-term patient centred out comes in this awake prone patient need more
          investigation.
          Why read on?
          Our study is first of its kind (Systematic review and Meta-analysis) summarising the evidence
          surrounding the less invasive innovate technique of prone position in non-intubated COVID-19 patients.

          Take-home message: Prone positioning in non-intubated severe COVID 19 patients demonstrated
          improvements in their oxygenation. However, significant heterogeneity in of duration and frequency of
          prone positioning and in other respiratory supports provided limit any further interpretation. Whether this
          improvement in oxygenation results in meaningful patient-centred outcomes needs testing in clinical
          trials.

          INTRODUCTION
          Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
          (SARS-CoV-2), mainly affects the respiratory system and can lead to acute hypoxaemic respiratory
          failure. 0.9% to 32% of these patients require admission to intensive care units (ICU) for advanced
          respiratory support.1-4 A surge in critically ill patients with respiratory failure has overwhelmed ICU
          capacity in many healthcare systems across the world. Studies published during the early phase of the
          pandemic have showed poor outcomes in invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients. Given a guarded
          prognosis and significant resource constraints                less-invasive, innovative approaches such as prone
          positioning (PP) of non-intubated patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure was considered. They were
          initiated in emergency departments (ED), hospital wards, or in ICUs as an adjunct to conventional oxygen
          therapies, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV).5 6
          The potential efficacy of PP with hypoxaemic respiratory failure is yet to be meaningfully tested in well-
          designed clinical trials. Limited data suggests that PP in non-intubated patients is feasible and is
          associated with an improvement in oxygenation in patients with respiratory failure.7 There have been case
          reports and cohort studies that report the use of PP of non-intubated patients with COVID-19 during the
          pandemic.2 8-10 Conceptually, awake PP is relatively less time and resource consuming as compared to PP
          in intubated patients. Theoretically, they may decrease the risks of adverse events seen in intubated prone
          patients.
          Deteriorating oxygenation despite optimal less-invasive respiratory support11 is one of the common
          triggers for invasive mechanical ventilation. PP improves oxygenation by increasing ventilation–
          perfusion matching by the recruitment of the larger number of alveolar units located in dorsal areas of the
          lungs.12   13
                         Furthermore, in patients with COVID-19, PP may also enable gravity assisted diversion of
          pulmonary blood flows to dorsal regions in the setting of pulmonary vascular dysregulation and loss of
          hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction response in selected patients.14 Thus, the success of PP largely
          hinges on its ability to reliably and predictably improve oxygenation, which may then subsequently
          improve the respiratory drive, thereby decreasing the risk of self-inflicted lung injury or respiratory
          fatigue.
          Little is known about the magnitude of the effect of PP on oxygenation and its ability to improve patient-
          centred outcomes in non-intubated COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we performed this systematic review
          and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of PP on oxygenation parameters. Secondary analysis included
          rates of endotracheal intubation and in-hospital mortality.
                                                                                                                                5

          METHODS
          The protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO
          (CRD42020194080). The study was conducted in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for
          Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Statement.15
          Eligibility criteria
          Studies on laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hypoxaemic adult patients (≥18 years of age) requiring
          supplemental oxygen who received PP were included. Studies were excluded if (a) they were systematic
          reviews (b) they did not report on oxygenation parameters (either PaO2, SpO2 or PaO2/ FiO2) (c) case
          reports or case series with fewer than 5 patients (to decrease reporting bias). The corresponding authors of
          a study were contacted for missing information required for the analysis.
          Search strategy, Information Sources and Study Selection
          Two authors (MR and AZ) independently searched on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus and the
          COVID-19 living systematic review from December 1st, 2019 to July 23rd, 2020. COVID-19 living
          systematic review has a daily-updated list of pre-print and published articles relating to COVID-19
          obtained from PubMed, EMBASE, medRxiv and bioRxiv.16 The living systematic review was previously
          used during the Zika virus epidemic17 and recently has been validated against an Ovid search relating to
                          18
          COVID-19           . Search terms were “Prone”, “Prone Position*” or “Proning” along with “COVID-19”-
          related terms were used within the title and abstract columns of the systematic review list. Our search was
          further supported by medical librarian search that was carried out independently (SW). A detailed search
          terms and tools are summarised in Supplementary Table 1. No language restrictions were applied.
          Quality Assessment and risk of bias in individual studies
          The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale               (NOS)19 was used to assess the quality of cohort studies while Joanna
          Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist20 was used to evaluate case series. Using relevant appraisal
          tools, each study was objectively evaluated by two reviewers independently (MR and ZL). Any
          discrepancies in the approval scores were reviewed and resolved by an additional reviewer (AS)
          (Supplementary Table 2).
          Study Outcomes
                                                                                                                                6

          The primary outcome was the change in oxygenation (i.e., PaO2/FiO2 ratio, PaO2 and SpO2) following PP.
          Different variables, such as the saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2), the partial pressure of arterial
          oxygen (PaO2), and the ratio of PaO2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2), have been used in
          the reported studies. We derived the PaO2 from SpO2 and vice versa if they were not reported in studies
          using the accepted conversion formulae for consistency to analyse the data (Supplementary Table 3).21
          For mall number of studies an estimation formula was used to convert median to mean values
          (Supplementary Table 4).22 Median was derived for PaO2 in 3 studies, for SPO2 in 5 studies and for
          PaO2/FiO2 in 2 studies. Sensitivity analyses for physiological parameters were performed by restricting to
          studies with sample sizes ≥20.
          The secondary outcomes included endotracheal intubation rate and mortality. Major adverse events were
          defined as cardiac arrest, clinically significant haemodynamic instability or accidental dislodgment of
          intravenous line following PP. Further subgroup analyses were performed to compare: (1) the primary
          outcome between patients with pre-PP PaO2/FiO2 >150 and PaO2/FiO2 ≤150; and (2) the primary and
          secondary outcomes in patients depending on the location within hospital where PP was initiated (within
          ICU vs. outside ICU). We also performed an exploratory analysis on the changes in patients’ respiratory
          rate (RR) after PP.
          Data Analysis
          Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software package Stata-Version 16 (Statacorp,
          USA). Mean (standard deviation [SD]) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) were used for numerical
          data and proportion for categorical data. We report weighted mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence
          intervals (95%-CI) for physiological parameters and event rates using a random effects model to account
          for both within-study and between-study variances.23 Results were presented in Forest plots.
          Heterogeneity was tested using the χ² test on Cochran’s Q statistic, which was calculated using H and I²
          indices. The I² index estimates the percentage of total variation across studies based on true between-
          study differences rather than on chance. Conventionally, I2 values of 0–25% indicate low heterogeneity,
          26–75% indicate moderate heterogeneity, and 76–100% indicate substantial heterogeneity.24 A subgroup
          analysis using different sample sizes was carried out to identify the possible causes of substantial
          heterogeneity.24 Due to concerns of the limited available data we could not pre-specify the exact variables
          for subgroup analysis. Following data collection, we carried out two subgroup analyses on oxygenation
          and clinical outcomes-: ICU vs. non-ICU (emergency department [ED], respiratory wards, high
          dependency units [HDU]) and baseline PaO2/FiO2 ratio (PaO2/FiO2 ≤150 and >150). Symmetry of the
          funnel plots was evaluated, and the Egger’s regression test was used to examine for publication bias.25 A
          p-value <0.05 was considered significant.

          From 248 studies we identified 15 eligible studies2 9 10 26-37 and a total of 449 patients were included in the
          final analysis (Figure 1) The 15 included studies are summarised in Table 1. The reports originated from 6
          countries (China, France, Iran, Italy, USA and UK). 287 patients were men (63.9%) with a mean age (SD)
          of 56 (7) years. The patients received PP for a variable duration (median 180 minutes, IQR 37.5-264.75)
          and this procedure was repeated 1-13 times/day during their hospital stay or until intubation, if it
          occurred. Data on oxygen therapy provided during PP was reported in 350 patients. 68.9% (241/350)
          received NIV, 4.9% (17/350) on HFNC, 13.7% (48/350) received oxygen via face mask, 12.6% (44/350)
          via low-flow nasal cannula. Among the 277 patients for whom FiO2 was reported, 175 (63.2%) of them
          received FiO2 <50%, 46 (16.6%) were on FiO2 between 50-70% and 56 (20.2%) of them received FiO2
          >70% (Supplementary Table 5).
          In the 420 patients for whom data on the location of provision of PP was available, 111 patients (26.4%)
          received PP in ICU and 309 (73.6%) outside ICU (respiratory wards, high dependency units or
          emergency departments).
          Primary outcome:
          The improvements in physiological parameters (PaO2/FiO2, PaO2, SpO2) before and after PP are presented
          graphically in Figure 2.
          PaO2/FiO2 post-PP: The ratio was reported in 11 studies.2 9 10 27-30 32 33 35 37 The PaO2/FiO2 improved post
          PP (MD 37.6, 95%-CI 18.8, 56.5; p=0.001) (Figure 3). Heterogeneity persisted despite analysing studies
          with a sample size of more than 20 patients (4 studies,2 9 28 33 I2=97.1% p=0.001) (Supplementary Figure
          1). However, the Egger's regression test ruled out publication bias (p=0.38).
          PaO2 post-PP: PaO2 was reported or derived from SpO2 in 13 studies2 9 26-36 (Figure 3). An improvement
          in PaO2 was demonstrated following PP (MD 30.4, 95%-CI 10.9,49.9). The heterogeneity was high
          (I2=99.8%) (Supplementary Figure 2). Egger's regression test                      (p<0.001) suggests, presence of a
          publication bias. The heterogeneity continued to be high when only studies with more than 20 patients2 9
          26 28 31 33 36
                         (I2=99.9%; p=0.001) were analysed.
          SpO2 post-PP: SpO2 was reported in 12 studies.2 9 27-36 Improvement in SpO2 (MD 5.8, 95%-CI 3.7, 7.9;
          p=0.001) was seen across all studies where SpO2 was obtained (Figure 3). However, there was high
          heterogeneity (I2=94.4%) and Egger's regression test ruled out publication bias (p=0.82). The
          heterogeneity continued to be high when only studies with more than 20 patients (6 studies2 9 28 31 33 36
          I2=99.9%; p=0.001). (Supplementary Figure 3).

          Secondary Outcomes:
          Intubation after a trial of PP was reported in 14 studies.2 10 26-37 A total of 90 patients out of 426 (21.1%)
          were intubated following a trial of PP. The studies demonstrated moderate heterogeneity (I2=74.3%). The
          Forest plot and Funnel plot for intubation is presented in Figure 4. However, there was no publication bias
          (Egger's regression test p=0.52).
          Mortality in patients who underwent awake PP was reported in 13 studies.9                        10 26-29 31-37
                                                                                                                          Overall, 101

          patients out of 390 (25.9%) died. The studies demonstrated high heterogeneity (I =83.6%), however, there
          was minimal publication bias (Egger's regression test p=0.51). The Forest plot and Funnel plot for
          intubation is presented in Figure 4.
          Funnel plots and Egger's Regression test for intubation and mortality are illustrated in Supplementary
          Figure 5.
          There were no reported life-threatening or major adverse events following PP. Only reported minor
          events included pain in the back, sternum or scrotum; general discomfort, dyspnoea and coughing and
          confusion in a small number of patients.26 36 37
          Oxygenation outcomes were analysed based on the mean pre-PP PaO2/FiO2 ≤150 (5 studies10 28 29 33 37) or
          >150 (6 studies2         9 27 30 32 35
                                                 ). Patients with a Pre-PP PaO2/FiO2 ≤150 had statistically significant
          oxygenation improvements post-PP (MD=37 [95%-CI 17.1-56.9] vs. MD=40.5 [95%-CI -3.5-84.6]) when
          compared with those with a pre-PP PaO2/FiO2 >150 (Figure 5).
          Eight studies2 9 26-36 reported changes in RR upon PP. There was a significant reduction in RR post-PP
          (MD -2.9, 95%-CI -5.4 to -0.4). High heterogenicity was observed (I2=93.4%) (Supplementary Figure 6)
          which persisted despite exclusion of smaller studies (I2=77.5%; p=0.01).
          About a quarter of patients (111/410) received PP in ICU while others (309/410) received it in HDU,
          general wards and respiratory unit areas of the hospital. Physiological and clinically relevant outcomes
          were compared between these two locations (Supplementary Figure 7). In studies that reported on
          PaO2/FiO2 ratio, there was relatively higher improvement in PaO2/FiO2 in ICU patients (ICU MD=43.5
          [95%-CI 11.5-75.4; p=0.001]) when compared with non-ICU patients (MD=40.8 [95%-CI 20.6–60.9;
          p=0.001]). PaO2 improvement was statistically significant in ICU patients (MD=23.8 95%-CI 14.7-32.9),
                                                                                                                                  9

          whereas the improvement was insignificant in non-ICU group (MD=49.4 95%-CI -6.6-105.5). The
          overall improvement in SpO2 was 6.0% (95%-CI 3.8-8.2), however the difference was statistically
          insignificant between ICU (MD=5.82 95%-CI 2.46-9.16) and non-ICU (MD=6.54 95%-CI 4.31-8.76)
          location for PP (p=0.73). Of the 90 patients who were subsequently intubated; 64 patients (71.1%)
          received PP outside ICU (28.9% [26/90] in ICU vs. 71.1% [64/90]; p=0.002). Mortality data were
          available in 12 studies9 10 26-29 31-34 36 37 where patients had PP either in ICU or outside ICU. A total of
          23/255 patients died (12.6% [14/111] in ICU vs. 9.6%. [9/94] in Non-ICU areas; p=0.49).
          DISCUSSION
          This systematic review examined the effect of PP of non-intubated patients on oxygenation parameters in
          a heterogenous group of adult patients with COVID-19-related hypoxaemic respiratory failure. There was
          a significant improvement in oxygenation parameters (PaO2/FiO2, PaO2 and SpO2) and respiratory rate
          upon PP. An improvement in these parameters was consistent, although there was significant variability
          in both treatment dose and effect. However, due to the inconsistency of reporting physiologic outcomes, it
          was unclear which of these parameters may provide the best clinical guidance in terms of both patient
          selection for PP and evaluation of treatment response. Other relevant data for example, relative changes in
          patients respiratory drive, dyspnoea scores and patient comfort were not consistently available. Given
          these limitations, the population that clearly stands to benefit from PP could not be clearly defined.
          Although all patients demonstrated improved oxygenation, the patients with PaO2/FiO2 ratio of ≤150
          demonstrated a greater improvement. The reasons may possibly be that patients with more severe
          hypoxaemia had a greater degree of pulmonary vascular dysregulation and ventilation: those with
          perfusion mismatch to start with and benefited more with PP. However, such an interpretation is
          speculative and not much inference can be drawn from these data as an improved oxygenation with PP
          depends on several factors such as timing, duration, underlying pathophysiology and other respiratory
          supports used. For example, the duration of and frequency of prone ventilation were quite variable with
          some studies reporting a combination of lateral positioning and PP. Such variability is a concern when it
          comes to feasibility and generalisability of PP outside of centres that have some experience in PP of
          awake patients.
          In addition, there was significant heterogeneity in oxygen therapies provided prior to and during PP. For
          example, 69% of the patients were receiving NIV and 12.6% were receiving oxygen via nasal cannula.
          These two populations can be drastically different and may represent different stages of disease evolution.
          This is likely to have a significant bearing on adjunctive use of PP as essentially the outcomes depend on
          the success of combinations of these therapies. It should be noted that ARDS studies only tested PP in
          intubated patients enrolled patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ≤150 to bring in some homogeneity in an otherwise
          heterogenous population of ARDS. In a recent network meta-analysis of trials of adult patients with acute
                                                                                                                              10

          hypoxaemic respiratory failure,38 treatment with non-invasive oxygenation strategies compared with
          standard oxygen therapy was associated with lower risk of death. Most of the included studies predated
          the RECOVERY trial39 and there was no consistent reporting on use of steroids or other disease
          modifying therapies limiting interpretation of the findings of the review.
          Although there were no reported major adverse events following PP, not all included studies reported
          adverse events. Therefore, safety and efficacy of this intervention can only be tested in a well-designed
          randomised controlled trial and they are ongoing.40 41 Placing critically ill, hypoxaemic, non-intubated
          patients in a prone position outside closely monitored units without ability to administer invasive
          mechanical ventilation when required may lead to poor outcomes. PP should be carefully undertaken in
          systems where this can be safely provided pending further evidence. Equally, PP may be considered as a
          useful adjunct in patients who are considered not suitable candidates for invasive mechanical ventilation
          while making sure their comfort and dignity is also prioritised.
          In a selected group of patients who received PP, the incidence of intubation and mortality was relatively
          lower in comparison with a recent systematic review and meta-analysis on associations of non-invasive
          oxygenation strategies and all-cause mortality in COVID-19, which reported rates of 40% and 30%
          respectively.38 In the absence of appropriate controls who did not receive PP for comparison, it is unclear
          whether these physiologic improvements resulted in reduced need for intubation or mortality. A
          noticeable difference was observed between the patients who had PP in ICU compared with other areas of
          the hospital both in terms of improvement in oxygenation and intubation rates. The oxygenation
          improvements were more marked in patients who underwent PP in ICU and there were corresponding
          lower intubation rates in ICU patients. However, a recent cohort study did not show any reduction in
          intubation rates or 28-day mortality in COVID-19 patients who received awake PP as an adjunctive
          therapy to HFNO.42 It is possible that a selected patient population of non-intubated patients with
          COVID-19-related respiratory failure may benefit from PP. However, data available for this review was
          not of sufficient quality to identify the precise population that may benefit. Based on this review, PP
          appears feasible and safe in patients who are hypoxaemic and when undertaken in appropriately
          monitored environments.
          Our study has some important limitations. This review was based on data from single arm observational
          case series and cohort studies that had no comparator groups. Consequently, heterogeneity and all the
          antecedent biases associated with patient selection and reporting was expected. The heterogeneity
          persisted despite sensitivity analyses were performed based on sample size. Given the inconsistent
          reporting of oxygenation parameters, we had to derive some of the variables from other reported variables
          and where possible requested missing data from the corresponding authors of the included studies.
          Despite this, we still had missing variables in some of the included studies. This calls for a validated
                                                                                                                              11

          system to report changes in physiologic parameters in future studies that test respiratory supports in non-
          intubated patients. Healthcare worker infection risks and rates while assisting/facilitating PP were not
          reported in any of the studies. In addition, strong conclusions cannot be reached due to several factors:
          first, the absence of tested, established triggers and a standardised process for initiating PP in non-
          intubated COVID-19 patients; second, the significant heterogeneity in the patient populations included
          and lack of granular data on co-interventions used (NIV, HFNC, Steroids, Antiviral therapies etc.); third,
          an absence of standardised intubation criteria; and, fourth, that the intervention was provided in some
          instances under pandemic stressors that affected resource availability.
          CONCLUSION
          There was a variable but significant improvement in oxygenation parameters with PP in non-intubated,
          hypoxic adult patients with COVID-19-related hypoxaemia. This review observed a lack of a standardised
          process for PP in non-intubated patients. Significant heterogeneity, inconsistent reporting, poor data
          quality and potential biases in data may affect the analysis. Absence of standardised intubation criteria
          and the provision of the intervention under pandemic stressors further limit interpretation. Well designed,
          randomised control studies testing the efficacy of PP in non-intubated COVID-19 patients are needed
          prior to widespread adoption of this practice.
