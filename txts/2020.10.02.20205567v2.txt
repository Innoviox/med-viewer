   ABSTRACT
   Background and Objectives: COVID-19 convalescent plasma has become an experimental treatment
   option against SARS-CoV2. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of different pathogen reduction
   methods on the immunological properties of COVID-19 convalescent plasma.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 140 plasma doses collected by plasmapheresis from COVID-19
   convalescent donors were subjected to pathogen reduction by three different methods: methylene blue
   (M), riboflavin (R), and amotosalen (A). To conduct a paired two-sample comparison, individual plasma
   doses were divided into 2 samples that were subjected to one of these methods. The titres of SARS-CoV2
   neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) and levels of specific immunoglobulins to RBD, S- and N- proteins of
   SARS-CoV-2 were measured before and after pathogen reduction.
   Results: All methods reduced NtAbs titres significantly but not equally: among units with the initial titre
   80 or above, 81% of units had unchanged titres while 19% decreased by 1 step after methylene blue;
   60% were unchanged and 40% decreased by 1 step after amotosalen; whereas after riboflavin 43% were
   unchanged, 50% had a one-step decrease and 7% a two-step decrease. Paired two-sample comparisons
   (M vs A, M vs R and A vs R) revealed that the most prominent and statistically significant decrease in all
   studied parameters (except anti-RBD) resulted from the riboflavin treatment.
   Conclusion: Pathogen reduction with methylene blue and amotosalen provides the greater likelihood of
   preserving the immunological properties of the COVID-19 convalescent plasma compared to riboflavin.

   Introduction
   The new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues its march around
   the world, causing a global crisis as the number of new cases and deaths continues to rise. The treatment
   is supportive care mostly aimed at relieving symptoms. Candidate vaccines are still going through
   different stages of clinical trials, and different classes of drugs are being tested to inhibit virus replication
   and reduce inflammation [1, 2, 3] .
   Passive immunotherapy with polyclonal antibodies from the blood plasma of convalescents was tested
   earlier in the outbreaks of SARS-CoV, influenza and other dangerous infections of the twentieth century
   [4, 5, 6]. Experts from different countries came to consider the possibility of using COVID-19
   convalescent plasma (CCP) for therapeutic purposes in patients with COVID-19 [7, 8, 9]. In many
   countries, national campaigns have been launched to collect CCP.
   Various mechanisms have been suggested as responsible for the therapeutic effect of CCP such as virus
   neutralization and immunomodulation [10]. Virus neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) of IgG, IgM and IgA
   classes bind to different parts of glycoprotein S, including the region of the receptor-binding domain
   (RBD), spatially blocking its interaction with the membrane protein ACE2 of host cells, which limits the
   penetration of the virus into the cell, thereby limiting viral replication [11, 12, 13].
   Every plasma transfusion is associated, however, with risks of virus transferal such as HIV, HBV, HCV, etc.
   [14]. At the moment, there are no scientific publications reporting on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2
   through the transfusion of blood components [15]. The Working Party on Global Blood Safety of the
   International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) recommended the use of pathogen inactivation of
   convalescent plasma to minimize the residual risk of blood-borne infections and to address the problem
   of possible superinfection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus [8].
   To date, there is no data on how pathogen reduction affects the immunological properties of CCP and
   what methods of pathogen reduction are preferable to use to maintain its quality and effectiveness.
   The objective of this study is to assess the effect of various methods for pathogen reduction on the
   immunological characteristics of CCP.

   Materials and methods
   The COVID-19 convalescent plasma procurement program in Russia was launched on April 2, 2020 at the
   Department of Transfusion Medicine of the Sklifosovsky Research Institute of Emergency Medicine,
   Moscow. At present, this program involves many hospitals in several regions and has more than 3000
   donations and about 1500 transfusions of CCP in Moscow alone. According to the adopted regulations,
   donors of convalescent plasma were recruited among the individuals with prior diagnosis of COVID-19
   infection documented by a positive RT-PCR-test who received treatment either in a hospital setting or on
   an outpatient basis. Donors fulfilled the standard blood donor selection criteria. Plasma was collected at
   least 2 weeks after the complete disappearance of clinical symptoms.
   Plasmapheresis procedures were performed using Auto-C, Aurora and PCS2 machines. Plasmapheresis
   was carried out in accordance with standard protocols collecting an amount of 650 ml plasma. Pathogen
   reduction procedures were carried out immediately after the end of plasmapheresis. For comparison,
   three systems for pathogen reduction were selected: Intercept – (amotosalen plus UVA light), Mirasol
   (riboflavin plus UVB light) and Macotronic (methylene blue plus visible light). Subsequently, the plasma
   was frozen and became available for clinical use after receiving negative results of all serology/virology
   tests for transfusion-transmitted diseases.
   This study included 140 doses of plasma obtained by plasmapheresis from 140 COVID-19 convalescent
   donors at our Department of Transfusion Medicine. From each plasma unit, samples were collected
   before and after pathogen reduction for the determination of the titres of SARS-CoV2 neutralizing
   antibodies (NtAbs), as well as quantitative determination of specific IgG to the receptor-binding domain
   (RBD) of the glycoprotein S of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and specific IgM and IgG to S- and N- proteins of this
   virus.
   To conduct a paired two-sample comparison to assess the effect of each of these methods on the
   immunological parameters of CCP, the plasma dose from one donor was divided into 2 parts and each
   part was simultaneously subjected to a pathogen reduction procedure by one of the two methods
   according to the following scheme:
   pair 1: methylene blue (M) vs. riboflavin - 48 pairs;
   pair 2: amotosalen (A) vs. riboflavin (R) - 36 pairs;

   pair 3: methylene blue (M) vs. amotosalen (A) - 56 pairs;
   Since we had 140 samples before treatment, in total 420 (=48*2+36*2+56*2+140) samples were
   analyzed.
   The titres of SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies were measured by a microneutralization assay on a Vero
   E6 cell culture [16] modified at the Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and
   Microbiology, Moscow, with an assessment of the virus' cytopathic effect after 96 hours of incubation.
   The virus neutralization titre of the studied plasma was taken as its highest dilution, at which the
   cytopathic effect is suppressed in 2 out of 3 wells.
   Determination of specific anti-RBD IgG was carried out at the same institution by the enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using their own SARS-CoV-2-RBD-IFA-Gamaleya test system (registered in
   Russia, RZN 2020/10393).
   In parallel, quantitative determination of IgM and IgG antibodies to a mixture of recombinant S- and N-
   proteins of SARS-CoV-2 was carried out by the immunochemiluminescent method (IHLA) using reagent
   kits for Shenzhen Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics Co., Ltd (China).
   Since the data for NtAbs are presented in the format 10 multiplied by an integer power of two (i.e., 20,
   40, 80, 160 etc.) we log-transformed the data: y=log2(x/10), where x is the reported value of NtAbs
   In order to identify the methods of pathogen reduction which have the least negative effect on NtAbs
   levels, we applied the two-sample paired T-tests (M vs A, M vs R, and A vs R) to the difference in
   reduction in titres of NtAbs, anti-RBD IgG, and anti-S + N IgG and IgM titres respectively, after pathogen
   reduction by different methods. The p-values < 0.05 were considered to be significant. No corrections
   were made for multi-significance. Confidence intervals were obtained using the standard methods for
   estimation of proportions. The software used for the analysis was MapleTM.
   Results
   The assessment of the impact of various methods of pathogen reduction on the titres of SARS-CoV2
   neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) showed a statistically significant decrease in antibody titres after all
   pathogen reduction processes (Figure 1, Table 1).

   If all plasma units, regardless of the initial titre were included in the analysis, it was shown that in 88%
   (n=104; confidence interval 81% - 94%) of units NtAbs titres did not decrease after pathogen reduction
   with methylene blue whereas a one step titre reduction was observed in remaining 12%. In 70% (n=88;
   95% confidence interval 61% - 80%) of units treated with amotosalen the NtAbs titre did not change, and
   in 30% it decreased by 1 step. Pathogen reduction with riboflavin left NtAbs titres unchanged in 61%
   (n=83; confidence interval 51% - 72%) of the units, in 35% decreased by one step and in 4% by two steps.
   To compare the impact of different methods of pathogen reduction, we used the data collected on
   paired data: the plasma units from the same donor were treated using e.g. method A and M, and then
   the resulting NtAbs were noted for both methods. We had three different datasets: one compared A vs.
   R, another dataset M vs. R and the third M vs. A. The results are the following: M is better than R (p-
   value=0.00002, n=48), A is better than R (p-value=0.0002, n=36), M is better than A (p-value=0.0012,
   n=56).
   When only units with the initial NtAbs titre 80 or above were chosen (this is the level that is generally
   considered to be suitable for therapeutic purposes) the distribution was similar: after treatment with
   methylene blue, 81% of plasma samples had unchanged NtAbs titres (n=53; confidence interval 71% -
   92%), while in the remaining 19% of samples the titres decreased by 1 step. Pathogen reduction with
   amotosalen gave worse results: 60% of samples had the same NtAbs after the reduction (n=55;
   confidence interval 47% - 73%), while in the remaining 40% samples the titres decreased by 1 step.
   Finally, after treatment with riboflavin, only 43% of the samples preserved the level of NTABs titres
   (n=30; confidence interval 26% - 61%), whereas a one-step decrease was observed in 50% samples, and a
   two-step decrease in 7% of samples.
   The decrease in anti-RBD IgG in paired comparison with baseline values was more pronounced after
   pathogen reduction with riboflavin whereas after amotosalen or methylene blue there were no
   significant differences (Table 1).
   Plasma pathogen inactivation with methylene blue did not lead to a significant decrease in anti-S + N IgG
   and IgM, whereas the use of amotosalen significantly reduced the level of anti-S + N IgG (Table 1). In the
   study of 83 pairs of samples before and after pathogen reduction with riboflavin, the differences were
   significant in the anti-S + N levels of both IgG and IgM (Table 1).

   Paired two-sample comparisons (M vs A, M vs R and A vs R) revealed the most prominent and
   statistically significant decrease in titres of NtAbs, anti-S + N IgG and IgM, but not anti-RBD IgG titres,
   after pathogen reduction by riboflavin (Table 2).
   Discussion
   The key safety issue of using convalescent plasma is played by the choice of a pathogen-inactivation
   method that minimizes the residual transfusion risk of transmissible viruses in the final product, while
   maintaining a high titre of antibodies to the SARS-Cov-2 virus. A number of different pathogen reduction
   methods are available today [17]. Ultraviolet (UV) A [18, 19] and UVB radiation [20], in combination with
   amotosalen and riboflavin, respectively, makes it possible to inactivate nucleic acids of pathogenic
   organisms. These systems can reduce the activity of SARS and MERS viruses in plasma or platelet
   concentrates to varying degrees.
   Methylene blue is a phenothiazive compound that, in combination with visible light, is also capable of
   inactivating coronaviruses in plasma [21, 22]. The photoactive agents used in these methods have
   different chemical structures and are activated at different wavelengths of radiation (visible light about
   590 nm, UVA from 400 nm - 315 nm and UVB from 315 nm - 280 nm). Consequently, various
   mechanisms are involved in ensuring the reduction of pathogens through the binding of nucleic acids.
   The current study is the first to examine the impact of pathogen reduction methods on SARS-CoV-2
   antibody levels in convalescent plasma.
   The hypothesis tested in this study is that different types of photo-chemical reactions used in the
   methods of pathogen reduction can have a different effect on the amount and functional activity of
   SARS-CoV2 specific IgG and IgM antibodies in the final product - convalescent plasma. The results
   obtained indicate a lesser effect on the immunological quality of CCP of pathogen reduction with
   methylene blue and amotosalen.
   Based on the study, we can recommend using inactivation methods with methylene blue and
   amotosalen to ensure the safety and quality of CCP, due to the greater likelihood of preserving the
   immunological properties of the final product. Since even these methods of pathogen reduction are
   associated with a risk of reducing the quantity and quality of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, it is
   recommended to transfuse at least 2 units of convalescent plasma (200-300 ml) from different donors to

   one patient, especially in those medical institutions where it is impossible to routinely reproduce
   techniques for determining NtAbs titres.
   In those blood establishments where pathogen reduction with riboflavin is traditionally used, it may be
   worth to consider increasing the dose of transfused convalescent plasma in order to compensate for the
   decrease in the baseline neutralizing antibody titres after this method of pathogen reduction.
