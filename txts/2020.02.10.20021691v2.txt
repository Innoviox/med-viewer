Background: Genetic variants can be used to prioritize risk factors as potential therapeutic
targets via Mendelian randomization (MR). An agnostic statistical framework using Bayesian
model averaging (MR-BMA) can disentangle the causal role of correlated risk factors with
shared genetic predictors. Here, our objective is to identify lipoprotein measures as mediators
between lipid-associated genetic variants and coronary artery disease (CAD) for the purpose
of detecting therapeutic targets for CAD.
Methods: As risk factors we consider 30 lipoprotein measures and metabolites derived from
a high-throughput metabolomics study including 24,925 participants. We fit multivariable
MR models of genetic associations with CAD estimated in 453,595 participants (including
113,937 cases) regressed on genetic associations with the risk factors. MR-BMA assigns to
each combination of risk factors a model score quantifying how well the genetic associations
with CAD are explained. Risk factors are ranked by their marginal score and selected using
false discovery rate (FDR) criteria. We perform supplementary and sensitivity analyses vary-
ing the dataset for genetic associations with CAD.
Results: In the main analysis, the top combination of risk factors ranked by the model score
contains apolipoprotein B (ApoB) only. ApoB is also the highest ranked risk factor with
respect to the marginal score (FDR< 0.005). Additionally, ApoB is selected in all sensitivity
analyses. No other measure of cholesterol or triglyceride is consistently selected otherwise.
Conclusions: Our agnostic genetic investigation prioritizes ApoB across all datasets con-
sidered, suggesting that ApoB, representing the total number of hepatic-derived lipoprotein
particles, is the primary lipid determinant of CAD.

Introduction
Genetic variants have the potential to contribute greatly to our understanding of mechanisms
underlying disease processes, and to guide target validation for pharmacological and clinical
interventions that reduce disease risk [1]. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common
cause of death globally. While it has been shown that genetic variants predisposing individu-
als to higher levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL)-cholesterol also associate with increased
CAD risk [2], genetic variants predisposing individuals to higher levels of high-density lipopro-
teins (HDL)-cholesterol are not associated with CAD risk [3] after accounting for other lipid
traits. These genetic analyses may suggest that LDL-cholesterol is a causal risk factor for
CAD risk, but HDL-cholesterol is not − as has generally been observed in clinical trials of
lipid-altering therapies [4, 5, 6]. Genetic studies have also suggested that triglyceride levels are
an independent risk factor for CAD risk [7]. Triglycerides are another component of body fat
which are transported by lipoprotein particles, and in particular by very low density lipopro-
teins (VLDL). However, two recent studies showed that genetic associations with CAD risk
are proportional to the change in apolipoprotein B (ApoB), the primary protein component of
VLDL, LDL, and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) particles, and that LDL-cholesterol
and triglycerides do not appear to be independent risk factors for CAD after accounting for
ApoB [8, 9].
     Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are increasingly used to combine genomic pro-
filing with high-throughput molecular measures on a large scale, including tens of thousands
of samples, to explore the genetic regulation of molecular processes. For example, Kettunen et
al. have combined high-throughput metabolomics with genomic profiling on nearly 25 000 in-
dividuals [10]. Given the large sample size, these studies are well powered to explore the causal
role of molecular mechanisms. The metabolomics study by Kettunen et al. was conducted
using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to provide a detailed characterization
of lipid-related traits, including 14 size categories of lipoprotein particles ranging from small
                                                                    3

HDL to extra-extra-large VLDL. For each lipoprotein category, measurements are available of
cholesterol, triglycerides, cholesterol ester, and phospholipid content. Additional mean diame-
ter of the lipoprotein particles is measured for some lipoprotein size categories. Measurements
also include apolipoprotein A1 and ApoB, sphingomyelins, fatty acids, and phosphoglycerides
(Supplementary Table S1 ).
    Previous MR studies on lipid determinants for CAD risk have included only a few curated
lipid traits at a time [8, 9]. In this study, we build on a high-throughput metabolomics data
resource [10] to investigate a much wider set of lipoprotein measurements as candidate risk
factors for CAD. We use a recently published algorithm called Mendelian randomization with
Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA) [11] that applies principles from high-dimensional data
analysis and machine learning to detect causal risk factors from a large set of candidate risk
factors. Our goal is to select the lipoprotein measures that are the most likely causal risk
factors for CAD.
Methods
Variable selection method for finding likely causal risk factors
We provide a brief outline of the MR-BMA method here. More details are given in the
Supplementary Material, and a diagram illustrating the method is shown in Figure 1.
    We consider each set of risk factors in turn: all single risk factors, all pairs of risk factors,
all triples, and so on. For each set of risk factors, we undertake a multivariable MR analysis
using weighted regression based on summarized genetic data. We assess goodness-of-fit in
the regression model, and assign a score to the risk factor set that is the model posterior
probability of that set being the true causal risk factors. We repeat this to get a posterior
probability for all models (i.e. all sets of risk factors). Then, for each of the candidate risk
factors, we sum up the posterior probability over models including that risk factor to compute
the marginal inclusion probability for the risk factor, representing the probability of that risk
factor being a causal determinant of disease risk. We also calculate the model-averaged causal
effect, representing the average causal effect across models including that risk factor. P-values
are calculated for each risk factor using a permutation method, with adjustment for multiple
testing via the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) procedure [12].
Study design
A summary of our study design is given in Figure 2. The three key steps in designing a
two-sample multivariable MR study are instrument selection, risk factor selection, and the
choice of outcome data, including main and sensitivity analysis.
Selecting lipid-associated variants as instrumental variables
We took an initial list of 185 variants associated with blood lipids (LDL-cholesterol, HDL-
cholesterol or triglycerides) in the Global Lipid Genetics Consortium at a genome-wide level
                                         −8

r < 0.05, and further refined by genomic distance, excluding variants that are less than 1
megabase pair apart, to provide a list of n = 150 genetic variants. We selected these lipid-
associated genetic variants as instrumental variables because we wanted to investigate lipid
determinants of CAD risk. This is important to keep in mind when interpreting the results as
the prioritization of risk factors by MR-BMA is conditional on the genetic variants selected as
instrumental variables. There are two direct consequences of this choice. Firstly, this choice
of instrumental variables will downweight non-lipid risk factors, and so results should not be
interpreted as evidence that those risk factors are not on the causal path to CAD. Secondly,
basing the selection of instrumental variables on an external dataset (e.g. the Global Lipid
Genetics Consortium) reduces the risk of winner’s course [13].
    We performed supplementary analysis with n = 55 genetic variants derived from the NMR
GWAS as instrumental variables to investigate how much the results depend on the choice of
instruments.
Lipoprotein measures as risk factors
Genetic associations with lipoprotein measures and metabolites are taken from Kettunen et al.
[10] who measured 118 variables on 24,925 European individuals using the high-throughput
Nightingale NMR platform. The contributing cohorts are mainly Finish (around 50%), with
several other Belgium (10%), Dutch (16%), Estonian (14%) and German (10%) cohorts
contributing. The majority of samples for measuring the biomarkers were collected after
overnight-fasting, otherwise the analyses were adjusted for time to last meal [10]. Estimates
were obtained by linear regression of each NMR measurement on each of the genetic variants
in turn, with adjustment for age, sex, time from last meal (if non-fasting), and ten genomic
principal components. NMR measurements were inverse rank-based normal transformed, so
that association estimates are presented in standard deviation units for the relevant risk factor
throughout.
    Several measurements from the Nightingale platform were highly correlated, judged by the
correlation between the genetic associations for the 150 genetic variants. While MR-BMA
was able to identify the causal risk factors reliably in a simulation study when risk factors
were highly correlated (up to ∣r∣ = 0.99) [11], several risk factors were more highly correlated
than this. We therefore pruned the set of risk factors to avoid inaccurate results due to
collinearity. For each lipoprotein diameter category representing the size of lipoproteins, we
retained only the measurement of cholesterol and/or triglyceride content, and mean particle
diameter where available. We also included only total fatty acid content and not other fatty
acid measurements, as genetic predictors that were able to distinguish reliably between these
risk factors were not included as instruments. Other non-lipoprotein metabolite measurements
were retained in the analysis as they had substantially weaker correlations with lipoprotein
measurements, and so would only be selected by MR-BMA if they mediated CAD risk from the
genetic predictors included in the model. No pair of risk factors included in the final analysis
were more highly correlated than ∣r∣ = 0.99 (see correlation heatmap in Supplementary Figure
S1 ). Finally, we only included risk factors into the MR analysis that had at least one genetic
variant that was a strong predictor (genome-wide significant). The final list of 30 lipoprotein
measures and metabolites included in the analysis is provided in Supplementary Table S1 .

Coronary artery disease as outcome
Our primary analysis was based on genetic associations with CAD risk taken from the 2017
CARDIoGRAMplusC4D data release meta-analysed together with UK Biobank [14] includ-
ing 453,595 individuals mostly of European descent, of whom 113,937 had a CAD event.
Genetic association estimates with CAD risk were obtained in each study of the CARDIo-
GRAMplusC4D consortium by logistic regression with adjustment for at least five genomic
principal components, and then meta-analysed across studies. There was one rare genetic
variant (rs1998013, effect allele frequency 0.8%, in the PCSK9 gene region) and one common
intergenic genetic variant (rs894210, effect allele frequency 43.5%) for which there was no
association estimate with CAD available. After excluding the missing genetic variants, we
performed MR-BMA with 148 variants and 30 risk factors.
    As supplementary analyses, we repeated the same analysis steps on the 2017 CARDIo-
GRAMplusC4D data release except: 1) we omitted the variant in the APOB gene region
from the analysis, to assess whether this variant was overly influential in determining the top
ranked models and 2) we omitted the ApoB measurement from the list of risk factors to see if
any other risk factor reached a similar level of evidential support. If it is the case that ApoB
was selected as representative for a group of highly correlated traits, then upon removal of
ApoB another risk factor of this group should be selected as representative instead.
    As sensitivity analyses, we considered 1) an earlier release of CARDIoGRAMplusC4D
consortium [15] including 60,801 CAD cases and 123,504 controls of European descent, but
not including UK Biobank participants and 2) a UK Biobank GWAS which includes 29,278
cases and 338,425 controls of European descent (defined by self-report and genomic principal
components). Quality control procedures were performed and related individuals were ex-
cluded from the analysis as described previously [16]. For the main and the two sensitivity
analyses we report the results including all variants and after excluding genetic variants that
are influential points and outliers.
    An overview of the data sources used to derive genetic associations with CAD risk is
provided in Supplementary Table S2 .
Results
Main analysis using outcome data from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D
and UK Biobank
Results are provided in Table 1. We show the top 10 models (i.e. sets of risk factors) ranked
according to their model posterior probability, and the top 10 risk factors according to their
marginal inclusion probability. We also present the model-averaged causal effect estimate
for each risk factor. The top-ranked model contains ApoB and no additional risk factors
(model posterior probability 0.464). ApoB is also the risk factor with the strongest overall
evidence (marginal inclusion probability 0.868, FDR< 0.005). A diagnostic scatterplot of the
genetic associations with the outcome against the genetic associations with ApoB is given
in Figure 3. Our primary analysis was performed after model diagnostics, which removed
                                                                    6

influential (Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Figure S2 ) and outlying genetic
variants (Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Figure S3 ) from the analysis. Similar
results were obtained including all variants in the analysis (Supplementary Table S5 ).
Supplementary analysis
As supplementary analyses, we first repeated the primary analysis excluding the genetic vari-
ant in the APOB gene region, to ensure that this variant was not driving the selection of
ApoB as a risk factor. This exclusion did not impact the results (Supplementary Table S6 ) –
ApoB remained the highest ranking individual model (model posterior probability 0.455) and
the risk factor with the strongest marginal evidence (marginal inclusion probability 0.862).
Secondly, we repeated the primary analysis excluding ApoB from the list of risk factors (Sup-
plementary Table S7 ). No alternative risk factor had similar strength of evidence, suggesting
that ApoB is indeed the most important risk factor and not just a representative of a group of
highly correlated lipoprotein measures with similar evidence. On exclusion of ApoB, the top
risk factors were triglycerides content in small HDL particles (marginal inclusion probability
0.461, FDR< 0.05) and LDL cholesterol (marginal inclusion probability 0.417, FDR< 0.05).
Yet, the evidence for these two lipoprotein measures is much weaker compared to the evidence
for ApoB in the main analysis.
    As final supplementary analysis we used n = 55 genetic variants derived from the NMR
GWAS as instrumental variables. After removing influential variants and outlying genetic
variants, ApoB is the risk factor with the strongest evidence (Supplementary Table S8 ).
This supplementary analysis has less power than the main analysis which is due to a smaller
number of genetic variants used as instrumental variables (n = 55 based on NMR GWAS
while n = 148 based on Global Lipids Genetics Consortium), yet it confirms ApoB as the
highest ranked risk factor. It is important to consider here the different interpretation which
depends on the selection of instruments. For the main analysis instrumental variables were
selected based on the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium with the aim to define lipid-related
risk factors for CAD. The supplementary analysis in contrast allows for a wider panel of NMR
metabolites as risk factors for CAD.
Sensitivity analysis
As sensitivity analysis, we used genetic associations with CAD risk from two alternative
datasets. Results are shown in Supplementary Table S9 . For the earlier release of CARDIo-
GRAMplusC4D [15], the top ranked model includes ApoB alone (model posterior probability
0.455), and ApoB is the top ranked risk factor overall (marginal inclusion probability 0.673,
FDR< 0.005). For UK Biobank, ApoB (marginal inclusion probability 0.325, FDR< 0.05) was
ranked second after triglycerides in very small VLDL-cholesterol (marginal inclusion probabil-
ity 0.456, FDR< 0.01). When looking at the individual models, triglycerides content in very
small VLDL-cholesterol particles is ranked first followed by models including both ApoB and
a measure of triglycerides content, suggesting an additional causal pathway via triglycerides
when deriving genetic associations from UK Biobank analysis.

Discussion
Our results add to the growing evidence that ApoB is the primary causal determinant for CAD
risk amongst lipoprotein measurements [17, 8, 18]. Cholesterol underlies the development
of atherosclerosis [19]. It enters the arterial wall within those ApoB-containing lipoprotein
particles that are small enough to enter the tunica intima from the circulation; these particles
include small VLDL, IDL and LDL particles as well as lipoprotein(a). The recent genetic
evidence, together with the results in this work, strongly point towards the direction that the
lipid content of the particles in secondary to ApoB [8, 18, 20].
    These results do not invalidate LDL-cholesterol as a causal risk factor for CAD risk.
Indeed, LDL particles contain an apolipoprotein B molecule, as do IDL and VLDL particles.
ApoB (in particular ApoB-100) represents the total number of hepatic-derived lipoprotein
particles [21]. However, this investigation suggests clinical benefit of lowering triglyceride
and LDL-C levels is proportional to the absolute change in ApoB. ApoB measurements are
independent of particle density, and are not affected by heterogeneity of particle cholesterol
content [22]. This is particularly important for accurately capturing the number of small
dense LDL particles, which are believed to be associated with atherosclerosis. ApoB has been
shown to be a superior measure to LDL-cholesterol in the prediction of CAD risk [23], and
in prediction of coronary artery calcification [24]. From a clinical perspective, statins target
LDL-cholesterol levels rather than ApoB, suggesting that greater benefit might be obtained
from lipid-lowering drugs that target lipoprotein particle number [25]. When analysing data
from UK Biobank only, there was also some evidence for triglyceride content measures as an
additional risk factor. This was not evident in the main analysis or the sensitivity analysis
including data from the earlier CARDIoGRAMplusC4D release. This finding should therefore
be interpreted with some caution.
    There are some caveats to the interpretation of the results of this study. Although we were
able to distinguish between measures of cholesterol content and triglyceride content for some
categories of lipoprotein particles, we were not able to distinguish between other lipoprotein
measures, such as cholesterol ester and phospholipid content, which correlated almost perfectly
with cholesterol content. Previous studies have suggested that the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio may
be a relevant risk factor for CAD [26]. However, working on summary-level data we were not
able to investigate any other relevant risk factors than those provided by the original data,
such as the ratio ApoB/ApoA1 or the ratio of LDL/HDL particles.A further limitation is
that there is overlap between individuals in the outcome datasets for the main and sensitivity
analyses. For this reason, we refer to them as sensitivity analyses rather than replication
analyses, as they assess the robustness of the variable selection algorithm to variations in the
outcome dataset, rather than providing an independent replication of the findings.
    One key strength of the study is that the genetic associations were derived on mainly
fasting samples, which facilitates the interpretation of the results. Fasting measurements
represent hepatic derived lipid traits while non-fasting samples also partly reflect gut-derived
contributions from chylomicron particles and their remnants. This means that our analysis
is well placed to answer causal questions about endogenous lipid pathways, but is less able to
answer questions about lipoproteins from dietary sources.
    In conclusion, our agnostic investigation to identify risk factors for CAD strongly prior-
                                                                    8

itized ApoB, suggesting that ApoB, representing the number of hepatic-derived lipoprotein
particles, is the key determinant of CAD risk amongst lipid-related measurements. This
analysis demonstrates the potential of publicly-available genetic association data from high-
throughput experiments combined with modern data-adaptive statistical learning techniques
for obtaining biological insights into disease aetiology.

     Table 1: Main analysis: Top 10 models (combination of risk factors) ranked by the model posterior probability and top 10 risk factors
     ranked by the marginal inclusion probability in the primary analysis based on n = 138 genetic variants after model diagnostics. Causal
     effects are log odds ratios for coronary artery disease per 1 standard deviation increase in the risk factor. Empirical p-values are computed
     using 1, 000 permutations and adjusted for multiple testing using False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure.
