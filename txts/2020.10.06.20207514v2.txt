  Abstract
  COVID-19 causes persistent endothelial inflammation, lung and cardiovascular complications.
  SARS-CoV-2 utilises the catalytic site of full-length membrane-bound angiotensin converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry causing downregulation of tissue ACE2. We reported
  downregulation of cardiac ACE2 is associated with increased plasma ACE2 activity. In this
  prospective observational study in recovered COVID-19 patients, we hypothesised that SARS-
  CoV-2 infection would be associated with shedding of ACE2 from cell membranes and
  increased plasma ACE2 activity.
  Methods - We measured plasma ACE2 catalytic activity using a validated, sensitive quenched
  fluorescent substrate-based assay in a cohort of Australians aged ³18 years (n=66) who had
  recovered from mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive result by PCR
  testing) and age and gender matched uninfected controls (n=70). Serial samples were available
  in 23 recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients.
  Results - Plasma ACE2 activity at a median of 35 days post-infection [interquartile range 30-
  38 days] was 97-fold higher in recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to controls (5.8 [2-
  11.3] vs. 0.06 [0.02-2.2] pmol/min/ml, p<0.0001). There was a significant difference in plasma
  ACE2 activity according to disease severity (p=0.033), with severe COVID-19 associated with
  higher ACE2 activity compared to mild disease (p=0.027). Men (n=39) who were SARS-CoV-
  2 positive had higher median plasma ACE2 levels compared to women (n=27) (p<0.0001). We
  next analysed whether an elevated plasma ACE2 activity level persisted following SARS-CoV-
  2 infection in subjects with blood samples at 63 [56-65] and 114 [111-125] days post infection.
  Plasma ACE2 activity remained persistently elevated in almost all subjects, with no significant
  differences between timepoints in post-hoc comparisons (p>0.05).
  Discussion - This is the first description that plasma ACE2 activity is elevated after COVID-
  19 infection, and the first with longitudinal data indicating plasma ACE2 activity remains
  elevated out to a median of 114 days post- infection. Larger studies are now needed to
  determine if persistent elevated plasma ACE2 activity identifies people at risk of prolonged
  illness following COVID-19.

  Background
  COVID-19 causes persistent endothelial inflammation, lung, cardiovascular, kidney and
  neurological complications as well as thromboembolic phenomena of unclear pathogenesis [1].
  SARS-CoV-2 utilises the catalytic site of full-length membrane-bound angiotensin converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry [2] causing downregulation of tissue ACE2. We have
  previously reported that downregulation of cardiac ACE2 is associated with increased plasma
  levels of the catalytically active site of ACE2 [3]. In this prospective observational study in
  recovered COVID-19 patients, we hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 infection would be
  associated with shedding of ACE2 from cell membranes leading to increased plasma ACE2
  activity levels.
  Methods
  We measured plasma ACE2 catalytic activity using a validated, sensitive quenched fluorescent
  substrate-based assay as previously described [3-5] in a cohort of Australians aged ³18 years
  (n=66) who had recovered from mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive
  result by PCR testing) and age and gender matched uninfected controls (n=70). Serial samples
  were available in 23 recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients. The immune responses in a subset of
  this cohort have been reported. [6] The study was approved by the University of Melbourne
  Human Research Ethics Committee (#2056689); all participants provided written informed
  consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
  Data were analysed with SPSS version 26.0. Plasma ACE2 activity levels were compared using
  the Mann-Whitney test or Kruskal–Wallis test and significance adjusted by Bonferroni
  correction for multiple tests. Serial ACE2 activity levels were analysed using the Friedman test
  for repeated measures; after post hoc analysis with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with a
  Bonferroni correction applied. Two-tailed P-values <0.05 were considered significant.
  Results
  The controls and SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects were matched for age (54 ± 11 vs. 53 ± 14
  years, p=0.49) and sex (37 (53%) vs. 39 (59%) male, p=0.46) (mean ± SD).
  Plasma ACE2 activity at a median of 35 days post-infection [interquartile range 30-38 days]
  was 97-fold higher in recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to controls (5.8 [2-11.3] vs.
  0.06 [0.02-2.2] pmol/min/ml, p<0.0001, Figure 1A). There was a significant difference in
  plasma ACE2 activity according to disease severity (p=0.033), with severe COVID-19
  associated with higher ACE2 activity compared to mild disease (11.2 [8.3-23.2] vs. 5.4 [1.8-
  9.0] pmol/min/ml (Figure 1B, p=0.027). Men (n=39) who were SARS-CoV-2 positive had
  higher median plasma ACE2 levels compared to women (n=27) (9.2 [5.8-15.3] vs. 2.1 [0.2-
  5.1] pmol/min/ml, p<0.0001), consistent with our previous findings in non-COVID-19 patients
  that males have higher plasma ACE2 activity levels than females [5].
  We next analysed whether an elevated plasma ACE2 activity level persisted following SARS-
  CoV-2 infection in 23 subjects with blood samples at 63 [56-65] and 114 [111-125] days post
  infection. This subset was representative of the overall cohort for age (52 ± 15 years), gender
  (14 (61%) male) and disease severity (mild 15 (65%), moderate 5 (22%), severe 3 (13%).
  Plasma ACE2 activity remained persistently elevated in almost all subjects (Figure 1C), with
  no significant differences between timepoints in post-hoc comparisons (p>0.05). There was no
                                                                                                                                  2

  change in plasma ACE2 activity in serial samples from a limited number of control subjects
  (n=8, timepoint 1: 0.8 [0.02-3.0] vs. timepoint 2: 1.4 [0.02- 5.9] pmol/min/ml, p=0.31).
  Discussion
  This is the first description that plasma ACE2 activity is elevated in patients after COVID-19
  infection, and the first with longitudinal data to indicate that plasma ACE2 activity remains
  elevated out to a median of 114 days post-infection, the last time point sampled. It is already
  known that males have higher plasma ACE2 activity then females, but this is the first report
  that plasma ACE2 activity levels are increased in those with more severe infection. Although
  the pathophysiologic cause and consequences of elevated plasma ACE2 activity in the setting
  of COVID-19 are unknown, we reported that increased plasma ACE2 is an independent risk
  factor for major adverse cardiac events in patients with cardiac disease [3, 5]. Others have
  recently shown that increased concentration of ACE2 was associated with increased risk of
  major cardiovascular events in a large global population-based study [7].
  In conclusion, we suggest that binding of SARS-CoV-2 to membrane ACE2 has at least 2
  effects. First, it downregulates membrane ACE2 causing a dysregulated local renin angiotensin
  system (RAS) that favours inflammation and ongoing tissue damage secondary to excess
  angiotensin II. Second, the dysregulated local RAS is associated with prolonged shedding of
  the catalytically active site of ACE2 into the circulation.
  In addition to the early multisystem effects of COVID-19, a proportion of patients experience
  prolonged ill-health [8]. There is growing concern over long COVID-19, how to define it and
  how to manage it. Larger studies are now needed to determine if persistent elevated plasma
  ACE2 activity identifies people at risk of prolonged illness following COVID-19 and to
  address whether therapeutic strategies directed at a dysregulated renin angiotensin system can
  reduce COVID-19 complications.

Figure 1: Plasma ACE2 activity is elevated in patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection (A), is increased with disease severity (B),
and remains elevated 2-3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Data shown as scatter points and box plot with whiskers representing min and max values of median plasma ACE2 activity between controls, and
patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection (A), and median plasma ACE2 activity in patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection
according to disease severity (B). The median [interquartile range] plasma ACE2 activity levels are shown above each bar. The median plasma
ACE2 activity in patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection with serial samples (n=23) are shown in (C). The median [interquartile range]
plasma ACE2 activity levels are shown above the bar for each timepoint. Two-tailed P-values <0.05 were considered significant.
