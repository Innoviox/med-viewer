38     ABSTRACT
39     Objective
40     Compare machine learning (ML) based predictive analytics methods compared to traditional
41     logistic regression in classification of olfactory dysfunction in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS-OD),
42     and identify predictors within a large multi-institutional cohort of refractory CRS patients.
43
44     Methods
45     Adult CRS patients enrolled in a prospective, multi-institutional, observational cohort study were
46     assessed for baseline CRS-OD using a smell identification test (SIT) or brief SIT (bSIT). Four
47     different ML methods were compared to traditional logistic regression for classification of CRS
48     normosmics versus CRS-OD.
49
50     Results
51     Data were collected for 611 study participants who met inclusion criteria between April 2011
52     and July 2015. 34% of enrolled patients demonstrated olfactory loss on objective testing.
53     Differences between CRS normosmics and those with smell loss included objective disease
54     measures (CT and endoscopy scores), age, sex, prior surgeries, socioeconomic status, steroid use,
55     polyp presence, asthma, and aspirin sensitivity. Most ML methods outperformed traditional
56     logistic regression in terms of predictive ability. Top predictors include known factors reported
57     in the literature, as well as several socioeconomic factors.
58
59     Conclusion
60     Olfactory dysfunction is a variable phenomenon within a large multicenter cohort of refractory
61     CRS patients. ML methods outperform traditional logistic regression in classification of
62     normosmia versus smell loss in CRS, and are able to include numerous risk factors into
63     prediction models. These results carry implications for basic science and clinical research in
64     hyposmia secondary to sinonasal disease, the most common cause of persistent olfactory loss in
65     the general population.

 66     INTRODUCTION
 67          Olfactory loss is common, affecting up to 25% of the adult population, with chronic
 68     rhinosinusitis (CRS) being a major cause of persistent olfactory loss [1]. Smell loss is considered
 69     a hallmark of CRS, particularly in those with nasal polyps, and is one of the cardinal diagnostic
 70     symptoms for CRS [2-4]. Curiously, this symptom does not affect all CRS patients. Just as CRS
 71     is a heterogeneous disease [5], previous literature has estimated a 20-80% prevalence of
 72     olfactory loss in CRS cohorts, based on the sensitivity of olfactory assessment used and the
 73     proportion of enrolled subjects with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). A recent study using well-defined
 74     CRS diagnostic criteria and objective testing using Sniffin’ Sticks assessment showed a 44%
 75     prevalence of smell loss in CRSsNP subjects and 58% in CRSwNP [6]. Risk factors associated
 76     with CRS-OD identified in this study included disease severity score on computed tomography
 77     (CT) the presence of comorbid conditions such as diabetes, allergy, and asthma. Adding a
 78     healthy control group for comparison, Schlosser et al. noted CRS-OD to affect CRSwNP patients
 79     more than CRSsNP, and identified age as an additional risk factor [7]. Given that most existing
 80     studies consist of single-institution cohorts, with subjects undergoing variable treatment
 81     regimens, and different assessments of smell function, a systematic review and meta-analysis
 82     was performed by Kohli et al [8] to clarify the presence of OD in CRS and identify consistent
 83     risk factors. The authors included 47 studies in the analysis, and identified age, CT score, and
 84     presence of nasal polyps as the three most consistent risk factors for CRS-OD in the published
 85     literature. Similarly, olfactory response to CRS treatment is highly variable, with resolution of
 86     smell disturbance after standard therapies occurring in only approximately 40% of refractory
 87     CRS patients [9].
 88          Olfactory dysfunction in CRS is potentially complex and the interplay among possible
 89     mechanisms is poorly understood. The simple model of conductive loss due to impaired odorant
 90     transport to the olfactory cleft in CRS may explain a portion of the disease for some patients.
 91     Additional contributions of local and systemic inflammation likely contribute to a varying degree
 92     in some individuals, with underlying factors such as age and presence of comorbid diabetes
 93     influencing the capacity for olfactory sensory neuron regeneration. Given the complex and
 94     multifactorial nature of CRS-OD, compounded by inherent challenges in human cohort studies, it
 95     is no surprise that putative predictors and their relative importance have been inconsistently
 96     identified across studies. Beyond the risk of sampling bias found in most single institution
 97     studies, existing publications attempt to identify predictor variables for CRS-OD generally
 98     through univariate regression models. But, these analyses cannot account for all possible
 99     predictor variables or interactions among variables, and therefore, may offer limited conclusions.
100     Additionally, attempting multivariable regressions that were not developed for predictive
101     performance or assessed as such, cannot be relied upon [10].
102          Traditional statistical approaches can model how system variables relate to one another and
103     generate corresponding metrics of statistical significance. However, novel data analytics
104     approaches including machine learning (ML) methods have shown improved classification
105     accuracy and can be utilized to predict future outcomes, rather than attempting to interpret
106     individual components within a system. ML approaches are particularly useful when there is a
107     role for including complex interactions that may otherwise be ignored or dismissed as noise
108     when using traditional statistics [11], such as in the case of CRS-OD.
109          Understanding the heterogeneity of CRS-OD and grasping multi-dimensional risk factors for
110     classification prediction is foundational for future clinical care and research. The objective of this
111     study was to test different ML models used for predictive analytics against traditional regression
                                                                           3

112     modeling for classification accuracy of OD in CRS patients. A secondary goal was to explore top
113     predictors in high-performing models to identify common predictor variables of high importance
114     that may help explain the heterogeneity of OD found among CRS patients.

116     MATERIALS and METHODS
117     Study Population
118               Adult patients (>18 years old) were recruited into a prospective, multi-center,
119     observational cohort study developed to evaluate treatment outcomes of endoscopic sinus
120     surgery (ESS), for which multiple reports have been previously published [12-15]. All study
121     patients were diagnosed with medically refractory CRS as defined by both the American
122     Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery 2007 guidelines and the European Position
123     Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2012 [3,4]. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at
124     each performance site governed all study protocols, informed consent documentation, and data
125     safety monitoring. Performance sites consisted of tertiary care sinus surgery centers located
126     within academic hospital systems in North America including: Oregon Health & Science
127     University (OHSU; Portland, OR; eIRB#7198), Stanford University (Palo Alto, CA; IRB#4947),
128     the Medical University of South Carolina (Charleston, SC; IRB#12409), and the University of
129     Calgary (Calgary, Alberta, Canada; IRB#E-24208), with central study coordination at OHSU.
130               At original study enrollment, participants were screened for demographics, social and
131     medical history including factors listed in Table 1. The diagnoses of asthma, allergy, and aspirin
132     sensitivity were made by presence of classic symptoms and self-report of prior testing. Subjects
133     with comorbid cystic fibrosis, ciliary dyskinesia, or autoimmune disease were not excluded from
134     final analysis. Participants were followed postoperatively through the standard of care for up to
135     18-months and asked to complete postoperative, study evaluations at regular 6-month intervals,
136     either during physician-directed appointments or follow-up study mailings utilizing the postal
137     service and self-addressed return envelopes.
138
139     Objective Measures of Disease Severity
140               Diagnostic measures of disease severity were collected as standard of care, and were also
141     used for investigational purposes. These well-established objective measures have been
142     recommended for clinical study [16], and include Lund-Kennedy nasal endoscopy scoring [17]
143     and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) radiographic imaging graded using the Lund-
144     Mackay scoring system [18]. Olfactory function was using the brief Smell Identification Test
145     (bSIT) in the years 2011-2013, and the Smell Identification Tests (SIT) in the years 2013-2015
146     (Sensonics Inc., Haddon Heights, NJ). Higher SIT total scores reflect a better sense of smell, and
147     categorical ratings of “smell loss” (anosmia + hyposmia) and “normosmia” were assigned based
148
149     on established scales [19-21].
150     Patient Reported Outcome Measures
151               Other patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) were documented but were not used
152     in the predictive analytics given the potential overlap between particular symptom ratings and
153     objective smell loss. Study PROMs included the 22-item SinoNasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22;
154     ©2006, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) [22,23], the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index
155
156     (RSDI) [24], and the questionnaire on olfactory dysfunction (QOD-NS) [25].

159               Protected health information was previously removed and study data was safeguarded
160     using unique study identification number assignment for each participant. Study data was
161     securely transferred from a HIPAA compliant, relational database (Access, Microsoft Corp,
162     Redmond, WA.) to the University of Colorado Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck
163     Surgery password protected research server, according to specifications of a Data Use
164     Agreement between OHSU and the University of Colorado.
165               Study data were evaluated descriptively while continuous and ordinal variables were
166     evaluated for assumptions of normality. Comparing variables between normosmics and those
167     with smell loss, Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables and Welch’s two sample t-
168     test was used for continuous variables. Statistical comparisons were reported using a type-I error
169     probability at the 0.050 level of significance. All statistical and data analyses were completed
170     using the R software program [26].
171
172     Machine Learning Approaches to Classification
173               Several machine learning predictive analytics models were applied, in order to compare
174     classification accuracy to tradition logistic regression, which was performed here with
175     backwards step-wise AIC variable selection. Random forests was chosen as it allows for non-
176     linear and interaction effects; conditional inference trees were used with permutation-based
177     variable importance scores for unbiased variable selection [27]. Similar to traditional logistic
178     regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), assumes only linear and
179     additive affects (without interaction) where regression coefficients are shrunk toward zero to
180     perform variable selection. In this model, unimportant variables are given coefficients equal to
181     zero, effectively removing them from the model. Along these lines, multivariate adaptive
182     regression splines (MARS) was also applied in a similar fashion to traditional logistic regression,
183     but it uses stepwise methods for variable selection and allows for nonlinear and interaction
184     effects. Lastly, the Support Vector Machine approach was applied with a radial basis kernel.
185               To evaluate classification accuracy, repeated 10-fold cross validation (5 repeats) was
186     used to tune and evaluate each model area. To deal with the fact that the two classes are
187     unbalanced (smell loss vs normosmia), down sampling was used within the cross-validation
188     procedure, as implemented in the caret R package. Up sampling was also applied, but produced
189     equal classification accuracy in terms of AUC. The method of “surrogate splits” [28] was used to
190     handle missing values in Random Forest. The missForest R package [29] was used to impute
191     missing values for all other models.
192               To identify the important predictor variables included in each classification algorithm,
193     permutation-based variable importance scores were used to rank variables from most to least
194     important in Random Forests, while the absolute value of the standardized regression coefficient
195     was used for LASSO variable rankinds. The IML R package [30] was used to calculate variable
196     importance scores for SVM using a permutation method. All variable importance scores were
197     scaled from 0 to 100, where the most important variable for the model has a score of 100. Of
198     note, for a given categorical variable, RF and LASSO calculate separate variable importance
199     scores for each category, whereas the approach used for SVM only calculates an overall score.

201     RESULTS
202     Final Cohort Characteristics
203               A total of 611 study participants met all inclusion criteria and were prospectively enrolled
204     between April 2011 and July 2015. Demographics and comorbid disease characteristics,
                                                                           5

205     examined by olfactory classification, are described in Table 1. The overall mean age for the final
206     cohort was 51.3 years (38.3, 61.7) years with slight female preponderance (53% female).
207     Approximately one-third of the cohort exhibited nasal polyps (35%).
208               Study participants were stratified by SIT category. Statistically significant differences
209     were observed between the normosmic and smell loss cohorts in terms of objective disease
210     measures (CT and endoscopy scores), age, sex, previous surgery, socioeconomic status, steroid
211     use, asthma/COPD, and aspirin sensitivity. Local conditions including nasal polyps, allergic
212     fungal rhinosinusitis, and deviated septum were also significant factors.
213
214     Smell loss vs Normosmia Classification Accuracy
215               A traditional logistic regression model for classification of baseline olfactory dysfunction
216     demonstrated on these criteria demonstrated acceptable accuracy in the context of CRS-OD
217     (AUC 0.707). Three of the four machine learning models outperformed the traditional statistical
218     approach (Table 2). The SVM approach was the most accurate, with a relatively good
219     classification accuracy (AUC 0.754) and much higher sensitivity than other the methods. LASSO
220     and Random Forest also outperformed logistic regression, whereas MARS performed worse than
221     all of the approaches.
222
223     Machine Learning Predictions: Top variables
224               ML algorithms are adept are recognizing patterns within complex data, but the lack of a
225     priori framework results in the inability to understand why the algorithm made its decisions. As
226     we see in the variable importance graphs (Figs 1, 2, Suppl Fig 1), the ML models each arrived at
227     somewhat different relative importances of a given predictor variable. SVM, the top predictor
228     model, included the most number of variables in its algorithm with nearly all inputs having
229     significant importance (Fig 1). Relative importance of predictor variables in Random Forests and
230     LASSO are shown in Fig 2 (and Suppl Fig 1) and in these models, fewer variables were
231     important and the most weight was placed on the presence of nasal polyps and the nasal
232     endoscopy disease severity score.
233               Top predictors across the approaches contain many factors associated with olfactory
234     function in previous studies, including steroid use, prior surgery, nasal polyps, aspirin
235     exacerbated respiratory disease, age, sex, and smoking history. Inflammatory disease severity, as
236     measured by CT and nasal endoscopy scores, are not surprisingly very important predictors of
237     CRS-OD.
238               Interestingly, socioeconomic factors such as insurance status, household income, race,
239     were among top predictors across the three models displayed. Comorbid medical conditions
240     including asthma, diabetes, septal deviation, alcohol use, and sleep apnea, are also of moderate
241     importance. Notably, these factors can be influenced by unrelated medical care, suggesting that
242     other approaches to improve general health and well-being may be considered as part of the
243     holistic approach to CRS-OD management. Although the presence of nasal polyps, asthma, and
244     AERD, are significantly associated with CRS-OD here and in prior literature, the presence of
245     allergic rhinitis by history or by skin testing appeared to carry relatively minimal weight in the
246     CRS-OD classifications.
247
248     DISCUSSION
249               CRS is a heterogeneous process in terms of presentation, subtypes, natural history and
250     responses to treatment [2]. In terms of CRS-OD, current data from a multi-institutional cohort
                                                                           6

251     studying olfactory loss in CRS with a sensitive olfactory test (Sniffin’ Sticks) demonstrates that
252     nearly 70% of the CRS population has significant olfactory loss, with 20% exhibiting complete
253     anosmia [7]. The pathophysiology of CRS-OD is ascribed to both sensorineural and conductive
254     effects of local tissue inflammation, on top of the myriad factors that can affect olfaction in the
255     general population [1,31]. In previous study, factors associated with worse baseline olfactory
256     function in CRS patients included nasal polyposis, asthma, age, smoking, and eosinophilia [32].
257     Other works have shown CRS-OD response treatment in ~40% of patients, with risk factors such
258     as olfactory dysfunction severity, nasal polyps, female gender, high socio-economic status and
259     non-smoking associating with better quality of life results. In multivariate regression, only nasal
260     polyps and degree of baseline olfactory dysfunction maintained statistical significance,
261     highlighting the importance of sample size and analytical methods to glean useful information
262     from a prospectively collected human dataset [10].
263               Here, we utilized ML-based data science approaches to interrogate a large multicenter
264     CRS cohort to test whether novel predictive analytics approaches could outperform the gold-
265     standard traditional statistical method of logistic regression. ML is defined as the use of
266     algorithms to break down data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about
267     some aspect. In doing so, ML provides a novel approach to uncover previously unrecognized
268     patterns among CRS-OD patients and thereby offers numerous advantages over regression
269     analyses, which have been traditionally employed in studies of CRS disease severity and
270     outcomes [33]. Whereas traditional statistical methods focus on modeling how system variables
271     relate to one another and what statistical inference (e.g. significance in p-values) can be made,
272     the goal of machine learning (ML) is not interpretation of individual components but prediction
273     of future outcomesTop predictorsIn this study, different supervised ML algorithms were used
274     map features of interest to the outcome or “label” of olfactory loss. We observed improved
275     prediction accuracy with most ML approaches, measured by AUC and sensitivity/specificity.
276     This advantage may be attributed to the ability of many ML models to handle high-dimensional
277     data in which more features exist than observations, whereas traditional statistical modeling with
278     a large number of potential features requires some form of dimension reduction or variable
279     selection. As a result, we believe that machine learning and artificial intelligence data analytics
280     are well-suited to prime research and eventually for precision medicine in olfactory disorders,
281     given the idiosyncrasies, nuances, and numerous possible predictor variables.
282               There are some limitations of the current study that should be addressed, the first is the
283     potential for sampling bias. Two major biases in healthcare ML are gender and race [34]. Details
284     of this cohort have been extensively published and include even distributions by age and sex.
285     Racial minorities and low socioeconomic status groups are underrepresented as a function of the
286     geography and practice referral patterns, the general lack of accessible and affordable healthcare
287     and racial disparities in the U.S. healthcare system [35]. A related concern is that models created
288     from our cohort data may “overfit” if new or unseen clinical data are applied. Certainly, these
289     approaches should be further validated but nonetheless demonstrate the important utility of novel
290     data science approaches to uncover unrecognized patterns and predictors from “noisy” human
291     data in a noisy disease process. There are likely potentially unrecognized but important data
292     inputs (i.e., molecular endotyping data) that are not yet clinically available. Serum markers, such
293     as peripheral eosinophilia and serum IgE, have been proposed for CRS in the past but have
294     generally been disappointing and do not appear to correlate with tissue levels [36,37] Some our
295     clinical data input fields may associate phenotypes with likely molecular endotypes, but such
                                                                           7

296     overlap is not universal [5]. It is an exciting direction for the near future to include molecular
297     based biomarkers to the input data, and test additional accuracy gained.

299     CONCLUSION
300               Here we demonstrate the importance of novel predictive analytics approaches in study of
301     clinical olfactory disorders. Although founded in data science principles, and capable of
302     recognizing patterns within noisy data, it is challenging to understand why the models make
303     predictions with comparable accuracy despite use of some different predictor variable.
304     Nonetheless, consistently observed predictors include some weighted interest in SES and other
305     potentially modifiable conditions such as asthma/AERD. Such approaches may have value for
306     both clinical counseling and guidance for future basic science and translational research.
