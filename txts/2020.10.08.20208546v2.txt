     37      SARS-CoV-2 genomic characterization and clinical manifestation of
     38      the COVID-19 outbreak in Uruguay
     39      Abstract
     40      COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
     41      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and declared by the World Health Organization a global
     42      public health emergency. Among the severe outbreaks across South America, Uruguay
     43      has become known for curtailing SARS-CoV-2 exceptionally well. To understand the
     44      SARS-CoV-2 introductions, local transmissions, and associations with genomic and
     45      clinical parameters in Uruguay, we sequenced the viral genomes of 44 outpatients and
     46      inpatients in a private healthcare system in its capital, Montevideo, from March to May
     47      2020. We performed a phylogeographic analysis using sequences from our cohort and
     48      other studies that indicate a minimum of 23 independent introductions into Uruguay,
     49      resulting in five major transmission clusters. Our data suggest that most introductions
     50      resulting in chains of transmission originate from other South American countries, with
     51      the earliest seeding of the virus in late February 2020, weeks before the borders were
     52      closed to all non-citizens and a partial lockdown implemented. Genetic analyses suggest
     53      a dominance of S and G clades (G, GH, GR) that make up >90% of the viral strains in
     54      our study. In our cohort, lethal outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly
     55      correlated with arterial hypertension, kidney failure, and ICU admission (FDR < 0.01),
     56      but not with any mutation in a structural or non-structural protein, such as the spike
     57      D614G mutation. Our study contributes genetic, phylodynamic, and clinical correlation
     58      data about the exceptionally well-curbed SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Uruguay, which
     59      furthers the understanding of disease patterns and regional aspects of the pandemic in
     60      Latin America.

     65      Introduction
     66                  The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, first discovered in Wuhan, China, in
     67      December 2019, rapidly extended throughout the globe, and among the >35 million
     68      confirmed positive people from >210 affected countries and territories, >1 million have
     69      died from the rapidly-spreading SARS-CoV-2 virus as of October 5th, 2020 [1].
     70                  Even though South America was mostly spared in the early months of the
     71      pandemic and was the last continent where it spread, it was severely hit with the arrival
     72      of the fall season to the Southern hemisphere. The virus is currently ravaging Latin
     73      America, with Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, and Mexico among the ten countries
     74      with the highest numbers of cases worldwide. In contrast, Uruguay, a small country
     75      located south of Brazil, has succeeded in maintaining a very low number of total cases
     76      (2,145) through the closing of its borders, a partial lockdown, and an early Test, Trace
     77      and Isolate (TETRIS) strategy [2]. Uruguay has a population of ~3.3 million
     78      inhabitants, of which more than a third (~1.3 million) live in the capital city of
     79      Montevideo, according to the last census in 2011 [3]. Montevideo is Uruguay’s most
     80      interconnected city due to the presence of its international airport and harbor. The first
     81      positive case was officially registered on March 13th, and almost seven months later,
     82      245,000 samples (>7% of the total population of Uruguay) had been tested. In March
     83      2020, after the first four positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 were reported in Montevideo,
     84      the government issued a responsible voluntary quarantine in the country, involving the
     85      closure of schools, public entities, and businesses, urging the population to stay home
     86      [4]. On March 24th, land, maritime, and air borders were closed, allowing only
     87      Uruguayan citizens to enter the country [5]. As of October 5th, 2020, 2,145 patients
     88      have tested positive, 1,831 recovered, 243 are active cases, and 48 patients died [6].

     89                  Viral genome sequencing (genomic surveillance) is a powerful approach to
     90      determine the origin of pathogen introductions into a certain location and trace and track
     91      the virus’s subsequent spread and evolution. It has been utilized to complement other
     92      epidemiological parameters determined by testing, contact tracing and implementation
     93      of other public health measures such as lockdowns [2,7-12].
     94                  Although preliminary phylogenetic analyses of Uruguayan SARS-CoV-2
     95      sequences have previously been communicated on pre-print websites [2,7], there
     96      remains a critical lack of knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 mutation, dispersal, and
     97      transmission patterns, and whether statistical associations exist among viral genomic,
     98      demographic, and clinical features. For example, a detailed phylogeographic analysis
     99      has not been undertaken to investigate the global dispersal dynamics with respect to
    100      Uruguay.
    101                  In the present study, we describe and build on genomic surveillance of a private
    102      nonprofit healthcare system in Uruguay’s capital, Montevideo, where SARS-CoV-2
    103      cases have been identified since March 17th. We have sequenced and characterized 44
    104      positive cases spanning March to late May. We build on the existing Nextstrain
    105      framework, a broadly used and universally recognized analytical platform for the
    106      analysis of global SARS-CoV-2 viral genome sequence data that has accumulated since
    107      the start of the pandemic [13] to analyze newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes
    108      sampled in Uruguay, and combine it with Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis of Sampling
    109      Trees (BEAST).
    110                  An important aim of this study is to identify the different SARS-CoV-2
    111      introduction events in Uruguay, located in a geographical region of the pandemic that
    112      has been understudied so far. Specifically, we aim at (i) identifying and investigating
    113      the importance of independent introduction events in establishing the COVID-19

    119      Materials and Methods
    120      Bioethics, sample collection & RNA extraction
    121                  The molecular lab at the Asociación Española Primera en Salud (AEPS) is a
    122      fully accredited clinical lab, regulated by the Uruguayan Ministry of Health (Ministerio
    123      de Salud Púbica, MSP). Sampling was done according to the regional IRB guidelines
    124      and the recommendations of the MSP. Our study was evaluated by the commission of
    125      bioethics and ethics in research of the AEPS, headed by Fernando García [14-16]. IRB
    126      approval was waived, because the genetic analysis was restricted to the virus and not the
    127      host, and clinical correlation analyses were done on fully de-identified samples (UY ID
    128      and GISAID IDs were given by the Uruguayan and New York research teams,
    129      respectively, and are not traceable to any medical record number). The participants
    130      provided informed oral consent, and the data were analyzed anonymously. For
    131      participants <18 years of age, formal written or verbal consent was obtained from the
    132      parent/guardian at sampling, and data were kept anonymously for the entire study. The
    133      molecular clinical lab at AEPS is accredited for diagnostic RT-PCR tests for SARS-
    134      CoV-2 (COVID-19) in Uruguay. Naso-oropharyngeal swabs were collected in viral
    135      transport media and RNA was extracted using the QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen
    136      Mini or Midi kit (Qiagen), respectively, and confirmatory qualitative commercial RT-
    137      PCR kits were used for diagnosis and screening (depending on critical availability
    138      during the outbreak) (Table 1). Full details in Supplemental Methods.

    143      Library Preparation, Sequencing, and Read Processing
    144                  To amplify the viral genomes in preparation for sequencing, we used the Swift
    145      Normalase Amplicon Panel (SNAP) SARS-CoV-2 Panel (Swift Biosciences, Whole
    146      viral genome single tube NGS assay, cat# SN-5XCOV296). The libraries were run on
    147      an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 300 cycle flow cell, as paid end 150, using dual indices.
    148      Both positive and negative control samples were also run during library prep but not
    149      sequenced. The negative control sample was water, and the positive control sample
    150      consisted of SARS-CoV-2 genome (Twist Biosciences, cat# 102024) serially diluted to
    151      100 viral copies mixed into 50 ng of Universal Human Reference RNA (Agilent, cat#
    152      18091050). Sequencing reads were demultiplexed with Illumina bcl2fastq v2.20
    153      requiring a perfect match to indexing barcode sequences, and aligned to the reference
    154      SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512.2, wuhCor1). Only samples with >23,000 bp
    155      unmasked sequences were further analyzed, and variants were called using bcftools
    156      v1.9. Details of the library generation and sequencing read processing are in the
    157      Supplemental Methods.

    159      Statistics
    160                  D’Agostino & Pearson normality tests were performed to assess whether data
    161      values followed Gaussian distribution and whether parametric or nonparametric
    162      statistical tests were indicated (GraphPad Prism v.8). As a result, correlation analyses
    163      were done using nonparametric Spearman rank tests. Correlation coefficients (r), P-
    164      values, adjusted P-values, and q values were calculated in Prism. P-values were
    165      adjusted for multiple comparisons using Holm-Sidak (α = 0.05). The false discovery
    166      rate (FDR) of q was calculated at 0.5%, 1% and 5%. Correlation analyses with a sample
    167      size of 44 had 80.7% power (હ = 0.05) to distinguish correlation coefficients that differ
    168      by 0.4 standard deviation units (G*Power 3.1.9.4).
    169
    170      Genetic analysis
    171                  Sequence retrieval and multiple sequence alignment. SARS-CoV-2 reference
    172      sequences were downloaded from GISAID EpiCoV and combined with our Uruguayan
    173      study sequences in MEGA v.5.2 software, also used for sequence quality analysis,
    174      capping, and data refinement, if applicable [17]. Sequence alignments were performed
    175      using MAFFT v7.471, FFT-NS-2 method [18]. Highlighter analyses were performed on
    176      MAFFT-aligned full SARS-CoV-2 sequences from our Uruguayan study cohort with
    177      reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1 as a master using the Highlighter tool provided by the
    178      Los Alamos HIV sequence database [19].
    179
    180      Inference of a time-scaled phylogeny
    181                  To infer our SARS-CoV-2 time-scaled phylogenetic tree, we selected global
    182      reference sequences used for the Nextstrain analysis specific for South America as of
    183      August 6th, 2020. This dataset consisted of 1747 sequences sampled between December

    186      Uruguayan sequences to generate an initial dataset containing 1821 viral whole-genome
    187      sequences (Table S2). Using the Nextstrain metadata to identify the accessions of
    188      interest, we then downloaded the latest whole-genome sequence alignment from the
    189      GISAID database.
    190                  We aligned the whole genome sequences using MAFFT v7.471 [18] and
    191      manually edited these by trimming the 5’and 3’ untranslated regions and removing any
    192      gap only sites and low-quality sequences. This resulted in one low-quality Uruguayan
    193      sequence being removed, and a total of 73 remaining. The manually-edited alignment
    194      was then used to construct a maximum likelihood tree with ultra-fast bootstraps of 1000
    195      replicates in IQ-TREE version 2.0.3 [20], using the GTR+F+I nucleotide substitution
    196      model selected by Bayesian information criterion using model test implemented in IQ-
    197      TREE. TempEst [21] was used to check for outlier sequences in the tree resulting in the
    198      removal of a further ten sequences, to make up a final data set of 1810 sequences. The
    199      tree was dated using TreeTime version 0.7.6 [22], specifying a clock rate of 8 x 10-4
    200      substitutions per site per year to replicate the original Nextstrain workflow analysis as
    201      faithfully as possible.

    203      Phylogeography analyses
    204                  To obtain an estimate of the number of independent introductions of SARS-
    205      CoV-2 into Uruguay, we performed a preliminary phylogeography analysis using the
    206      asymmetric rates discrete diffusion model implemented in BEAST version 1.10.4 [23],
    207      adopting the fixed tree approach [11]. This approach greatly reduces the computational
    208      time required to perform the analyses by annotating the phylogeography analyses onto a

    209      fixed time-scaled phylogenetic tree. Our model considered two discrete ancestral
    210      location states, i.e., Uruguay and non-Uruguay, and specified a Markov chain Monte-
    211      Carlo (MCMC) length of 1 million steps, sampling every 200 steps to produce a
    212      posterior distribution of trees containing 5,000 trees. The time-scaled maximum clade
    213      credibility tree (MCC) tree from the discrete model phylogeography analysis conducted
    214      in BEAST was then identified using TreeAnnotator, available as part of the BEAST
    215      package and visualized in FigTree v.1.4.4 [24]. The BEAST log files were inspected for
    216      convergence using Tracer version 1.7.1 [25]. All model parameters achieved effective
    217      sample size (ESS) values >200 indicating sufficient mixing and convergence to
    218      stationary.
    219                  To estimate the potential regional source(s) of the independent introductions into
    220      Uruguay, we then replicated this phylogeography analysis, but this time considered
    221      seven discrete ancestral location states, including Uruguay, Africa, South America,
    222      North America, Oceania, Asia, and Europe.

    228      Study population and clinical parameters
    229                  A total of 44 diagnosed positive COVID-19 participants were included in this
    230      study, 25 men and 19 women with a comparable mean age (and range) of 54 (15-92)
    231      and 59 (24-89) years, respectively. Sixty eight percent of the participants did not require
    232      hospitalization, 18% were hospitalized or received in-home care (9% on ventilation and
    233      5% on ICU), and 14% were deceased. Whereas the early COVID-19 positive cases in

    234      March were predominantly clade S infections, clade G viruses subsequently became
    235      dominant in April and May 2020. (Figure 1 A-C).
    236                  Our cohort’s cases came from 15 neighborhoods in the capital, Montevideo. The
    237      majority of the samples came from the central neighborhoods of Cordón and Pocitos,
    238      where the two biggest outbreaks within our cohort occurred (Figure 1B and Figure
    239      S1). Only two participants (from the Montevideo neighborhoods Pocitos and Prado)
    240      reported a possibility of travel-related infection after returning from Japan.
    241
    242      Diverse SARS-CoV-2 mutation profiles with increased prevalence of spike D614G
    243      variants and associated mutations in the evolving epidemic
    244             The SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants in our study group are very diverse and
    245      comprise sequences from clades S, V, G, GH, and GR (Figures 1A and 2A, Table S1).
    246      We found 446 mutations in our Uruguayan study sequences compared to the reference
    247      Wuhan.Hu.1 sequence [26], including three gaps. 313 were SNPs (non-amino acid
    248      changing), scattered across 60 positions, and 130 were amino acid-changing, scattered
    249      across 32 positions of the open reading frames (Figure 2A, B). We observed between 5-
    250      12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) resulting in 1-7 amino acid (AA)
    251      replacements per viral genome (Figure 2B, Figures S2 and S3). In chronologically
    252      sorted mutation/highlighter plots, various mutation patterns appeared in the first 2/3 of
    253      the study period, whereas in the last 1/3, the mutation patterns became more
    254      homogenous. In March and early April, ORF8 mutation L84S and the associated
    255      C8782T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) were most abundant (>1/3 of
    256      sequences) (Figure 2A, C, Figures S2 and S3). Both mutations have become known as
    257      clade S-defining mutations (mostly in sublineage A.5) [27]. In addition, we found three
    258      more SNPs to be significantly associated, namely C17470T, C25521T, and C26088T

    259      that all together build a strongly significant, positive correlation cluster composed of
    260      five mutations (Figure S4). Interestingly, after April, most sequences belonged to clade
    261      G (sublineage B.1), defined by the spike protein’s D614G mutation. 57% of our
    262      cohort’s sequences contain the D614G mutation co-occurring with SNPs C241T,
    263      C3037T, and C14408T, the latter causing the AA replacement P323L in the RNA-
    264      dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene of nsp12 (Figure 2A, C, Figures S2 and S4).
    265      As known from other global studies [27], clade S and G-associated mutations are
    266      largely exclusive, resulting in strongly inverse correlation clusters (Figure S4).
    267
    268      Phylogenetic assessment of the regional SARS-CoV-2 outbreak
    269                  To determine phylogenetic and epidemiologic characteristics of the Uruguayan
    270      SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, we performed a comprehensive set of phylogenetic analyses,
    271      including          maximum-likelihood             trees,    haplotype       networks,         Nextstrain-based
    272      phylogenetic placements, and Bayesian phylogeographic analyses using BEAST
    273      (Figures 3 and 4, Figures S5-S8). Focusing on all available Uruguayan SARS-CoV-2
    274      sequences that passed our internal and GISAID’s quality assessment (n=73), we
    275      observed an intermixing of our (44) and other (29) Uruguayan study sequences, both in
    276      maximum-likelihood IQ trees and in genetic-distance-based haplotype networks
    277      (Figure S5). Consistent with the mutational analysis of our internal data set (Figure 2),
    278      the phylogenetic analysis of the publicly available Uruguayan sequences reveals a
    279      predominance of clades S and G (G, GH, and GR), the former occupying most of the
    280      upper half of the maximum-likelihood tree (Figure S5A) and the right half of the
    281      haplotype network (Figure S5B), the latter the respective opposite halves, highlighted
    282      by green and red arrows for spike D614G and ORF8 L84S key mutations, respectively.
    283      The allocation of neighborhood data on the phylogenetic tree indicated regionally

    284      clustered appearances of phylogenetically related viruses, as most evident for Carrasco,
    285      Pocitos, Malvin, Reducto (all in Montevideo), and Rivera (Figure S5A).
    286
    287      Phylogeographic BEAST analysis reveals 23 introductions into Uruguay mostly from
    288      surrounding South American countries, resulting in five clusters
    289                  To assess global introductions and the regional spread of SARS-CoV-2 in
    290      Uruguay, we performed discrete phylogeographic analysis using BEAST with all 73
    291      Uruguayan sequences, complemented with 1737 global reference sequences, based on
    292      the global subsampling dataset suggested by Nextstrain (Table S2). Genetic distance-
    293      based haplotype networks indicated genetic relationships of Uruguayan sequences with
    294      those from other South American countries, Europe and Asia (Figure S6).
    295                  By explicitly considering the time and sampling locations of our sequences,
    296      BEAST analyses revealed further important details about the evolutionary relationships
    297      of our sequences. The time-scaled maximum clade credibility tree (MCC) generated by
    298      the discrete phylogeographic analysis of our 1810 SARS-CoV-2 sequences is presented
    299      in Figure S7 and shows a minimum of 23 independent introductions of the SARS-CoV-
    300      2 virus occurred. Collectively, these introduction events included representatives from
    301      seven of the GISAID clades (G, GH, GR, L, O, S and V) circulating worldwide and all
    302      were imported to the capital city Montevideo with the exception of one imported to
    303      Rivera.
    304                  The results of the discrete phylogeography analysis we performed that
    305      considered seven ancestral state locations further revealed that 18 of the 23 independent
    306      introductions are inferred to have originated from other South American countries. The
    307      remainder include two independent introductions of GISAID clade GR viruses from
    308      Asia, two from North America, and one clade V virus from Oceania (Figure 3). The

    309      viral sequences from the only two participants in our cohort that reported a possibility
    310      of travel-related infection after returning from Japan are inferred to have been imported
    311      from Asia and grouped on the tree within separate clades of Asian sequences. The
    312      estimated time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA), represented by the age
    313      of the root node of the entire tree, is in mid-December 2019 (9th-21st of December),
    314      which is in agreement with the estimated origin of the pandemic in the Hubei Province
    315      in China, sometime between October and December, and the first contracted case in
    316      China recorded in mid-November [28-31].
    317                  Only five of the 23 independent virus introductions into Uruguay resulted in
    318      monophyletic clades with more than two sampled sequences in the country. These
    319      clades comprised 21, 18, 5, 4, and 3 sequences, respectively (Figures 3 and 4, Figure
    320      S8), suggesting that these viral outbreaks were maintained by community transmission
    321      once introduced into Montevideo.
    322                  To investigate the timing of the introduction of the viruses that founded these
    323      five main clades circulating in Montevideo, we estimated the time of their most recent
    324      common ancestor (TMRCA), acknowledging that the actual introduction events likely
    325      occurred even before the corresponding TMRCAs.
    326                  The TMRCA of the first main clade of 21 sampled sequences, highlighted in red
    327      in Figure 4, was estimated to fall between the 2nd and 5th of March, 2020 and involved
    328      the importation of a GISAID clade S virus. Viruses within this transmission cluster
    329      were restricted to Montevideo, where they were distributed among nine of the local
    330      neighborhoods, including two Hospitals and one research institute (Figure S8). A North
    331      American sequence from Mexico was positioned basally to this clade on the tree
    332      identifying this country as the most plausible source location.

    333                  The TMRCA of the second main clade, which comprised of 18 virus sequences,
    334      highlighted in yellow in Figure 4, was estimated to fall between the 13th and 17th March
    335      2020 and involved the import of a GISAID clade G virus. Viruses within this
    336      transmission cluster were restricted to the city of Montevideo, where they were
    337      distributed among nine neighborhoods and included samples from two nursing homes
    338      and one hospital (Figure S8). The viral sequences in this clade were inferred to have a
    339      South American origin.
    340                  The TMRCA of the third main clade of five sampled sequences, highlighted in
    341      blue in Figure 4 and corresponding to a GISAID clade GR, was estimated to fall
    342      between March 20th and May 26th, 2020. This transmission cluster consisted of five
    343      viruses from the Hospital de Rivera in Rivera, a small city situated on the border with
    344      Brazil (Figure S8). This clade was inferred to have originated in South America and
    345      groups with a sequence from Brazil on the MCC tree suggesting this was the source
    346      location for this viral introduction
    347                  The TMRCA of the fourth main clade with four sampled sequences, highlighted
    348      in purple in Figure 4, was estimated to fall between March 14th and May 20th, 2020 and
    349      involved the introduction of a GISAID clade G virus into Montevideo (Figure 4). This
    350      clade comprised four viruses from within two Montevideo neighborhoods (Figure S8).
    351      The virus responsible for this introduction was also inferred to have originated in South
    352      America.
    353                  The TMRCA of the fifth main clade of three sequences, highlighted in green in
    354      Figure 4, was estimated to have occurred between 22nd and the 24th March 2019 and
    355      involved the introduction of a GISAID clade GR virus into Montevideo. This clade
    356      comprised three viruses from within a single Montevideo neighborhood (Figure S8).
    357      Collectively, sequences from the four main clades described above were sampled

    358      between March and May 2020 and were distributed among 17 of the 57 neighborhoods
    359      or barrios in Montevideo.
    360                  All of these five independent introduction events that formed sustained
    361      transmission chains identified here were estimated to have occurred close to the time of
    362      the first officially diagnosed case in Uruguay on March 13th, 2020 and the putative date
    363      of origin of the pandemic in Uruguay on March 7th , which was thought to be introduced
    364      by a single female traveler who arrived in Montevideo on a flight from Italy and
    365      subsequently attended a wedding reception in the city that was attended by over 500
    366      guests.
    367
    368      Distribution of SARS-CoV-2 within Uruguay
    369                  Within these five clades we identified a total of ten sequence clusters (sequences
    370      from the same institution that group together on the tree), spread across six of the seven
    371      health institutions from which we had more than one sample (Figure S8). These
    372      included one cluster of five GISAID clade GR sequences in the Hospital de Rivera (red
    373      dots), two clusters of two clade G sequences in the Hospital Vilardebó (green dots),
    374      three clusters each comprised of two clade S sequences in the Institut Pasteur (brown
    375      dots), and two clusters from the Asociación Española Primera en Salud (blue dots)
    376      comprising two S and two G clade sequences (Figure S8).

    378      Clinical correlations separate from mutational correlation clusters
    379             The availability of study participants’ clinical and demographic data combined
    380      with mutational data of the infecting SARS-CoV-2 viruses enabled us to perform
    381      comprehensive correlation analyses (Figures 5 and 6, Figures S9-S11). Overall,
    382      Spearman rank correlation analyses revealed six prominent correlation clusters of

    383      significant positive or mixed correlations (Figure 5, Figure S9). Four of the highlighted
    384      clusters in Figure 5 (clusters 1-4) are dominated by mutations that form mixed clusters
    385      with demographic parameters such as sampling location or treating healthcare
    386      institution and a few other parameters. Clusters 5 and 6 are different in forming separate
    387      clinical correlation clusters together with the parameters “sex” (cluster 5) or “age”
    388      (cluster 6) without essential associations to virus mutations. Cluster 5 reveals a
    389      significant association of female sex with clinically asymptomatic courses of the disease
    390      and a lower risk of developing fever. Cluster 6 indicates a network of positive
    391      correlations among age, lethal outcome, and five clinical parameters. In addition to the
    392      highlighted clusters, we observed some smaller clusters, mainly composed of mutations.
    393      The tight network of positive clinical correlations and a more outspread correlation
    394      network of clades with regional appearances and selected demographic parameters are
    395      shown in greater detail in Figure 6A. Specifically, statistical analyses of lethal outcome
    396      as study parameter revealed significant positive correlations with arterial hypertension
    397      (AHT), kidney failure and ICU admission complemented by borderline-significant
    398      associations with additional clinical parameters (hospitalization, diabetes mellitus II,
    399      and obesity) and age, but no association with any specific mutation (Figure 6B, Figure
    400      S10). Accordingly, the spike D614G mutation and clade G-related viruses, in
    401      consequence, are not associated with any clinical parameters, severity or lethality.
    402      D614G only correlates with co-occurring/inversely occurring mutations, treating
    403      healthcare institutions, and time since sampling started (Figure 6C, Figure S11).

    408                  The Uruguayan epidemic is characterized by an early clade S dominance that
    409      was subsequently replaced by clade G variants (Figures 1 and 2), which matches the
    410      global trend [27,32,33]. Uruguayan clade S viruses are characterized by the key
    411      mutations T28144C, causing the AA replacement L84S in ORF8, and C8782T, in
    412      agreement with global clade S strains [27]. In our data set, we observed three additional
    413      co-occurring SNPs in ORF1b and ORF3 that were present in 15 out of 17 clade S
    414      variants, i.e., C17470T, C25521T, and C26088T. These mutations are less common and
    415      are presumably characteristic of the regional outbreak. Further studies need to show
    416      whether this subclade will be fixed in regional and/or supraregional epidemics, and
    417      whether founder effects or functional features accounted for the early clade S
    418      dominance over the original clade as well as the subsequent fluctuating prevalence and
    419      decline. According to the CoV-GLUE database, ORF8 L84S is the 8th most prevalent
    420      AA replacement to date [34]. After a controversial debate about the ancestry of L and S
    421      types and the functional impact of L84S [35-38], the still limited amount of data
    422      indicates that L84S might confer selection advantage and render the virus more virulent
    423      based on destabilizing the immuno- and replication-modulatory protein ORF8 and
    424      mitigating binding of ORF8 to human complement C3b [35,37-39].
    425                  End of March/early April 2020, we observed a subsequent switch in dominance
    426      from clade S to clade G-variants (G, GR, and GH) (Figures 1 and 2). It positioned
    427      Uruguay somewhere in the middle in the asynchronous transition process from spike
    428      D614 to G614 virus predominance, i.e., between the early European and the mostly late
    429      Asian countries [32,33]. Diverse structural and functional assays strongly suggest that
    430      the spike D614G mutation renders SARS-CoV-2 more infectious by stabilizing its
    431      structure, i.e., through impact on the, compared to SARS-CoV-1, even more fragile
    432      metastable SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thus reducing the shedding of the S1 subunit.

    433      Furthermore, D614G triggers higher spike numbers on the virion surface and induces a
    434      more open, receptor-binding domain (RBD)-up spike conformation toward a receptor-
    435      binding and fusion-competent state [33,35,37,40-44]. In D614G spikes, binding to the
    436      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is not increased, and SARS-CoV-2
    437      viruses do not acquire D614G escape mutations in vitro under neutralizing antibody
    438      immune pressure [40,45]. Instead, D614G increases neutralization susceptibility of
    439      SARS-CoV-2, which assures high sensitivity to vaccination-induced neutralizing
    440      antibodies [46,47].
    441                  Although D614G serves as the clade G-defining mutation with likely effects on
    442      virus infectivity/transmissibility, D614G is governed by a very strict co-appearance with
    443      C241T, C3037T, and C14408T, both in Uruguayan and global G variants (Figure 5,
    444      Figure S5) [27]. Notably, in addition to the D614G-causing A23403G mutation in
    445      spike, C14408T is responsible for the AA replacement P323L in the RdRp gene. Based
    446      on their central roles in viral entry and replication, their co-evolution is of particular
    447      interest, and a mutual contribution to the selective advantage of G-haplotypes is
    448      assumed [33]. Interestingly, none of the viruses harboring a single clade G mutation
    449      prevailed to achieve epidemiological relevance, e.g., D614G alone or P323L alone have
    450      ≤0.3 global prevalence, whereas D614G and P323L together have ~70% global
    451      prevalence as of August 2020 [33]. P323L, although not located in the active center,
    452      possibly influences RdRp fidelity through allosteric effects at the nsp12 interface with
    453      the nsp8 cofactor and might increase the viral mutation rate [33,39,48 ]. Thus, the
    454      strong correlation patterns between key mutations in our Uruguayan data set, mirroring
    455      global patterns, allows us hypothesize that coupled mutations, such as D614G in spike
    456      and P3233L in RdRp might synergize for the epidemiological success of the virus. It
    457      may allow a fine balance between efficient transmission (e.g., by D614G, even in

    458      asymptomatic cases) and limited clinical presentation (e.g., by P323L, decreasing the
    459      production of viral RNA) to eventually attenuate an aggressive virus that, as shown for
    460      MERS and SARS-CoV-1, is more vulnerable to viral clearance with lack of long-term
    461      epidemiological success. Further studies are needed to determine how the increasing
    462      diversity of mutation patterns influence the fitness and reproduction of viral
    463      populations, the susceptibility/evasion to immune responses and treatment, and how
    464      these mutations are selected in the human body or during transmission.
    465                  Beyond the functional relevance of emerging and transmitted mutations, they
    466      serve as a fine tool to dissect population phylodynamics, transmission chains and
    467      epidemiologic clusters. The number of independent introduction events into a particular
    468      country as a proportion of the total number of sequences in the data set is considered a
    469      rough measure of the relative influence of intercontinental and international travel on
    470      the subsequent epidemiological dynamics within that country. For Uruguay, with 23
    471      identified independent migration events out of a total of 73 viral sequences in our
    472      dataset, this proportion is relatively low if compared to other countries such as Belgium
    473      (331/740) [11] but higher than others like Brazil (>100/490) [8]. It possibly indicates
    474      that the relative influence of intercontinental and international travel has been less
    475      important in driving the dispersal dynamics of the Uruguay outbreak compared to other,
    476      larger or more connected countries like Belgium. The town of Rivera, situated on the
    477      border with Brazil, has been a main concern for the government and many outbreaks
    478      occurred along the border that were rapidly brought under control. In line with our
    479      BEAST data that suggested a single transmission from Brazil as the main source of the
    480      Rivera infections, the first Rivera outbreak was reported to have begun when a COVID-
    481      19-positive Uruguayan was diagnosed on May 7th, 2020. Our BEAST analysis strongly
    482      supports the former hypothesis from the Uruguayan Government and Ministry of Health

    483      (MSP) that a local metallurgic worker that used to travel to Brazil everyday had been
    484      infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil and introduced this strain to Rivera [49,50].
    485                  There are two main reasons for why the extent of the geographical distribution
    486      and the density of viruses in each neighborhood within Montevideo and Rivera
    487      responsible for the five main clades of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Uruguay (Figure 4,
    488      Figure S8) represent an underestimate of the true values of both these variables. First,
    489      our 73 Uruguayan sequenced viral genomes represent only a relatively small fraction of
    490      the total number of infections that occurred in the actual outbreak seeded by these
    491      viruses, with estimates obtained from contact tracing efforts suggesting that collectively
    492      these viruses infected at least 364 individuals [2]. Secondly, 39 (53%) of our Uruguayan
    493      samples were either collected in hospitals (Hospital de Rivera, Asociacion Española -
    494      AEPS, or Hospital Vilardebó) where the infected patient was treated or where the
    495      infection was acquired, in nursing homes, or in research institutes (Institut Pasteur)
    496      where samples were processed. In these cases, the home address of the patient samples
    497      is not publicly available. This precluded the adoption of the continuous diffusion
    498      phylogeography model [51] that makes use of the actual geographic coordinates of the
    499      samples to infer the transmission links among the sampled locations in the various
    500      Montevideo neighborhoods, and instead, limited our analysis to describing the spatial
    501      relationships among the sampled SARS-CoV-2 sequences.
    502                  Our discrete phylogeographic analysis provided a new perspective to the
    503      believed origin of the Uruguayan SARS-CoV-2 outbreak from overseas by a single
    504      traveler returning from Europe [52-54]. While overall similarities of Uruguayan
    505      sequences with European and Asian sequences were observed in mutation patterns and
    506      genetic distance-based haplotype networks, our phylogeographic analyses using BEAST
    507      indicate that Uruguayan introductions that resulted in outbreaks were mostly restricted

    508      to neighboring South American countries (Figure 3), which stands in contrast to the
    509      suggestions of a recent preprint article [7]. Instead, our data support the idea that the
    510      outbreaks that were seeded after return from overseas travel, were contained
    511      successfully through social distancing, mask wearing, rigorous testing, contact tracing,
    512      and partial lockdown [2].
    513                  Having determined the regional SARS-CoV-2 mutation patterns and
    514      phylogeographic spread, the question remained whether and to what extent genomic
    515      features are coupled to demographic and/or clinical parameters. Our correlation data
    516      revealed significant clusters of co-occurring or mutually excluding mutations with
    517      regionally accumulated appearances of clades/mutation clusters (Figures 4 and 5,
    518      Figure S5). In contrast, the large bulk of clinical parameters clustered separately
    519      without major influence from viral mutations (Figures 5 and 6, Figure S10), which is
    520      in line with a recent publication that reported no significant impact of genetic variation
    521      on clinical outcome [55]. More specifically, we studied pairwise correlations with the
    522      spike D614G mutation, which, because of perfectly matching mutation patterns, also
    523      represents correlation analyses for the RdRp P323L mutation or G-related clades (G,
    524      GR, and GH). In an FDR-adjusted analysis, the presence of D614G mutation was
    525      coupled to other viral mutations, treatment of the infected patients in a regional
    526      healthcare institution, and late sampling, but not to clinical parameters (Figures 5 and
    527      6, Figure S11). There have been controversial reports of D614G being associated with
    528      higher fatality rates and/or severe illness in a few data sets [56,57], whereas more recent
    529      data suggests no correlations of D614G with clinical outcome [33], the latter supporting
    530      our findings. Our analysis of associations with clinical parameters pointed at significant
    531      associations between lethal outcome and arterial hypertension, kidney failure, and ICU

    532      admission, which mirrors clinical studies on associated factors or predictors of disease
    533      severity/progression [58,59].
    534                  In sum, our characterization of Uruguayan SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetics,
    535      mutation patterns, and their correlation with demographic and clinical parameters did
    536      not identify critical viral attenuations or clinical peculiarities that can primarily account
    537      for the exceptionally well curbed regional COVID-19 epidemic [2]. It instead suggests
    538      that socio-epidemiologic mitigation strategies managed to curtail COVID-19 to
    539      restricted regional transmission clusters in Uruguay.
    540                  We hope that these findings contribute to define the South American COVID-19
    541      outbreak better, to optimize and develop efficient, fast, and low-cost mitigation
    542      strategies and diagnostic pipelines for Uruguay and other countries, and to assist
    543      physicians dealing with strategies for this and future emerging infections.
