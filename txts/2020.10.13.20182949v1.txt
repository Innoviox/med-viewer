          KEY POINTS:
          Question: Do systemic and gut inflammatory mediators play a role in disease progression as well as
          development of antiviral responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection?
          Findings: IL-6 and sMAdCAM expressed as a novel integrative marker (sMIL index) are associated both
          with disease-states (early infection and convalescence) as well as development of antiviral humoral responses.
          Meaning: Further investigation into the utility of using sMIL index as a biomarker for disease progression
          and recovery, including the development of potentially neutralizing antiviral responses is warranted.
                                                                                                                                          3

          IMPORTANCE: Recent studies positing the gut as a sanctuary site for viral persistence in SARS-CoV-2
          infection highlight the importance of assimilating profiles of systemic as well as gut inflammatory mediators
          to understand the pathology of COVID-19. Also, the role of these markers in governing virus specific
          immunity following infection remains largely unexplored.
          OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of systemic and gut inflammatory markers in disease progression and
          development of anti-viral humoral immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
          DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study (n=58) of SARS-CoV-2 infected
          individuals included a group of in-patients (n=36) at various stages of disease progression together with
          convalescent individuals (n=22) recruited between April and June 2020 (peak of the epidemic) from a tertiary
          care hospital in Mumbai, India. Follow-up of 11 in-patients at day 7 post diagnosis was carried out, resulting
          in a total of 47 in-patient samples.
          EXPOSURES: Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections was confirmed by reverse transcriptase–polymerase
          chain reaction-based testing of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples.
          MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the measurement of inflammatory
          markers including Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines and levels of soluble mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule
          (sMAdCAM) in plasma. Anti-viral humoral response was measured by rapid antibody test (IgG, IgM) and
          chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) (IgG). Also antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were
          measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Secondary outcomes were correlation of the inflammatory
          signature with clinical information, including age, sex, disease duration and co-morbidities.
          RESULTS: Twenty eight of 36 (78%) in-patients and 19 of 22 (86%) convalescents were males. Out of 47
          in-patient samples, 22 (46%), 11 (23%) and 14 (30%) were IgG-/IgM-, IgG+/IgM+ and IgG+/IgM-
          respectively. Of 22 convalescent samples, 3 (14%), 1 (4%) and 17 (77%) were respectively IgG-/IgM-,
          IgG+/IgM+ and IgG+/IgM-. Two out of 22 (9%) convalescents showed high IL-6 levels (>100pg/ml) and 4
          (18%) had high TNF levels (>30pg/ml). However, the convalescents (n =22) had significantly lower levels of
          IL-6 [Median=27.48 (IQR=23.54-39.92)] compared to followed up in-patients (n = 11) at day 0
          [Median=111(IQR=68-129.7), p =0.0002 ] and higher levels of sMAdCAM [Median=1940 (1711-2174)
                                                                                                                                          4

          pg/ml] compared to these individuals at day 0 [Median=1701 (IQR=1532-1836) pg/ml; p=0.032] and day 7
          [Median=1534 (IQR=1236-1654) pg/ml; p=0.0007]. Further, IL-6 and sMAdCAM levels among in-patients
          inversely correlated with one another (r = -0.374, p = 0.009, CI = 95%). When expressed as a novel integrated
          marker –sMIL (sMAdCAM/IL-6 ratio) index, these levels were incrementally and significantly higher across
          various disease states with convalescents exhibiting the highest values [Median= 64.74 (IQR=47.33-85.58)].
          Also, the sMIL index was significantly higher in convalescents (with class-switched responses) compared to
          IgG+/IgM+ individuals at early stages of infection [Median=28.65 (IQR=13.63-96.26), p = 0.034]. Real-time
          measurement by SPR of plasma antibody binding to viral nucleocapsid (NC), receptor binding domain (RBD)
          and spike (S) revealed waxing and waning of plasma antibody responses to all 3 targets. Importantly,
          sMAdCAM levels as well as sMIL index (fold change) correlated with peak association rates of RBD-binding
          (r = 0.462, p = 0.03, CI = 95%) and fold change in binding to S (r = 0.68, p = 0.050, CI = 95%) respectively.
          CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our results highlight key systemic and gut-associated immune
          parameters that need to be monitored and investigated further to optimally guide therapeutic and prophylactic
          interventions for COVID-19.

          Introduction:
          Having established itself in the human population, the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its associated pathology
          (COVID19) is a subject of intense study with implications for public health globally1–3. Inflammation,
          especially that mediated by ‘cytokine storm’ seems to be the primary etiological factor driving progression of
          COVID-19 disease4. Persistent viral infection in sanctuaries such as the gut together with post-infection
          immunological sequelae are also emerging as relevant disease management issues that need to be addressed5–
          7
            . Recent studies have identified key inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF that are dysregulated and
          appear to play a significant role in mediating pathology8,9. Also, the role, if any, of these cytokines and the
          associated inflammatory response in governing virus specific immunity remains largely unexplored following
          both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. Understanding and identifying such signatures may guide
          current therapeutic and vaccine development efforts to ensure optimal disease management for COVID-19. In
          this study, we undertook to examine cross-sectionally and longitudinally, profiles of inflammation, including
          a gut associated marker governing mucosal lymphocyte migration, across various stages of disease
          progression following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Concurrent evaluation of virus specific humoral immunity was
          also carried out to understand the link between these profiles and the generation, persistence and real-time
          binding kinetics of antibodies against various viral antigens. Our results highlight a putative immunological
          marker that seems to govern both disease progression as well as generation of anti-viral antibodies to the
          neutralizable receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2.
          Materials & Methods
          Study population, setting, and data collection: A total of 36 in-patients and 22 convalescent individuals
          were recruited (from April-June, 2020), following informed consent, for the study from the isolation ward at
          Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases (Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai). Pregnant women,
          prisoners, and children (less than 18 years of age) were excluded from the study. The Kasturba Hospital and
          ICMR-NIRRH institutional ethics committees approved this study. We obtained demographic data, clinical
          history at presentation, and laboratory results during admission.
                                                                                                                                          6

          Blood samples for the study were handled in accordance with ICMR guidelines for biosafety. Whole blood
          (1-3 ml) was collected in EDTA vacutainers and plasma was separated by centrifugation at 425 g for 10
          minutes. IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in fresh plasma samples using Rapid
          test from either Voxpress (Voxtur Bio LTD, India) or Tell me fast (Biocan Diagnostics Inc., Canada) kits and
          also by ARCHITECTTM AbbottTM (Abbott Diagnostics, USA) chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA)
          directed against SARS -CoV-2 anti-NC IgG. Remaining plasma samples were aliquoted and stored at -800 C
          until batch analysis of cytokines, soluble mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (sMAdCAM) and
          antibody binding profile using surface plasmon resonance (SPR).
          Cytokine Bead Array
          Human Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines kit (BD CBA kit Cat no. 560484, NJ, USA) was used to measure IL-2, IL-4,
          IL-6, IL-10, TNF, IFN-γ and IL-17 cytokine levels in plasma of study participants using 50 µl of plasma
          sample, as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Data was acquired using the BD AccuriTM C6 cytometer and at
          least 5000 events were acquired gated on selected bead population and analysis was carried out using the BD
          C6 Accuri analysis software. GraphPad Prism was used to extrapolate individual cytokine concentrations
          from a standard curve.
          MAdCAM ELISA
          Human MAdCAM-1 DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D Systems-DY6056-05, Minneapolis, USA) was used for
          estimation of soluble MAdCAM-1 in plasma in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. Plasma
          concentrations of sMAdCAM was calculated by interpolating absorbance values from a standard curve and
          multiplying by dilution factor.
          Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analysis
          The binding analysis of real time interaction between patient plasma and SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Spike, RBD
          and Nucleocapsid) was carried out using the SPR spectrometer (Biacore 3000, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences
          AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Flow cells of CM5 (carboxmethylated dextran matrix) sensor chip were activated
          with 0.2 M 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and 0.05 M N-
          hydroxysuccinimide. SARS-CoV-2 proteins at a concentration of 20 μg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5,
                                                                                                                                          7

          were immobilized on the activated CM5 chip to about 1400 response units (RUs), and the unreacted groups
          were blocked with 1.0 M ethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.5. The flow cell, which was not immobilized with any
          protein, served as negative control. Diluted plasma (1:10) in 10 mM HBS-EP, pH 7.4 running buffer was
          injected over the protein-immobilized CM5 chip for 150s (association phase) followed by subsequent
          dissociation for 150s and spectra recorded. All the experiments were performed at 25 °C, and the flow rate
          used was 20 μl/min. At the end of each experiment the surface was regenerated using a 25 μl pulse of 10 mM
          Glycine-HCL, pH 2.5 to remove any bound analyte. Sensorgrams were corrected by subtraction of the signal
          from the negative control surface as well as pre COVID-19 plasma.
          Data were evaluated using the BIAevaluation software program (4.1 version, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences
          AB). The 1:1 Langmuir model was used for fitting the experimental data and for calculation of association
          response differences and dissociation rates (kd).
          Statistical analysis
          Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 8 using non parametric tests. Statistical significance of
          differences between groups were assessed using Mann-Whitney U-test. Follow up data from same individual
          was compared with Wilcoxon matched-paired signed rank test. Spearman's rank-order correlation was used to
          analyse the association between participant attributes and statistical significance was accepted at p<0.05.
          Results:
          Demographic and clinical characteristics of in-patients and convalescent individuals
          During the period from April through June 2020, 36 in-patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection and under
          isolation were recruited at Kasturba Hospital. Of these 11 were followed up 7 days post admission. A total of
          22 individuals, clinically documented to have been recovered and discharged were also recruited as
          convalescents. Convalescent individuals had 2 consecutive negative respiratory swabs or were cleared of
          symptoms prior to discharge and their blood samples were collected atleast 2 weeks post discharge. The
          demographic, serological and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown and summarized in eTable 1 in
          the Supplement and Table 1 respectively.

          As apparent from these tables our study cohort included individuals that were analysed in a cross-sectional,
          longitudinal (0 day and 7 day time points) manner and at clinically distinct (in patients and convalescent)
          stages of disease progression. Also, as expected, males pre-dominated and individuals with co-morbidities
          constituted a significant proportion (20/58; 34%) of the cohort. Serological data evaluated through both a
          rapid test (IgG, IgM) and CLIA (anti-NC IgG) showed an overall concordance of 77% for IgG and also
          allowed us to group these individuals based on IgG and/or IgM positivity. When grouped in this fashion it
          was interesting to note that while a majority of convalescent individuals ~76% (19 out of 22) were
          seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 about 14% (3 out of 22) were seronegative both by CLIA and rapid test (Table
          1 and eTable 1 in the Supplement). Also, as a group, convalescent individuals seemed to have lower levels of
          circulating anti-viral antibodies following infection.
          Inflammatory cytokine profile and gut translocation
          As shown in (eFigure 1A and 1B in the Supplement), elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF were observed both in-
          patients as well as, of note, in convalescent individuals compared to those similarly and previously measured
          for healthy individuals in the Pre-COVID-19 era10. Also, these levels spanned a range of sero-positivity in
          terms of virus specific IgG and/or IgM.
          Increased levels of these cytokines (IL-6 and TNF) did not correlate with either initial Ct values, with each
          other or with that of any other cytokine measured (eFigures 2 and 3 in the Supplement). Additionally and for
          the first time we report on gut inflammatory/migratory marker sMAdCAM (Figure 1 and eFigure 1c in the
          Supplement) which appeared to be circulating at levels within those reported for healthy individuals11. When
          these levels were examined longitudinally (eFigure 4 in the Supplement) in a group of 11 individuals that
          were followed at day 0 (day of diagnosis) and day 7 (post diagnosis) we noticed a declining trend for IL-6 but
          not TNF and sMAdCAM levels.
          However, analysing these individuals based on disease progression clearly demonstrated a declining
          circulating IL-6 but not TNF concentration (Figure 1). Stratification of the in-patient data (eFigure 5 in the
          Supplement) on the basis of gender revealed a marked difference in circulating levels of IL-6 and sMAdCAM
          where women had significantly lower and higher levels respectively.

          sMAdCAM:IL-6 ratio (sMIL index): A novel biomarker for disease progression.
          Results obtained from the heretofore described analyses (Figure 1 and eFigure 5 in the Supplement) suggested
          that sMAdCAM and IL-6 levels independently track (eFigure 6A and 6B in the Supplement) with disease
          progression, albeit in opposing directions. Suspecting an underlying association between both of these
          apparently unrelated signatures, we examined the utility of their being combined as an integrated marker that
          could better correlate and discriminate between various stages of infection.
          Remarkably, when levels of both these analytes were expressed as a ratio we observed (Figure 2) a clear
          delineation of in-patient and convalescent data into discrete categories based on disease progression (Figure
          2A and eFigure 6C in the Supplement), gender (Figure 2B), time from infection (Figure 2C) and intriguingly
          serological status (Figure 2D). These observations seemed to posit a role for this index in the development of
          antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
          Anti-viral responses and the role of inflammatory markers.
          Anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses were measured using SPR, which allowed us to obtain a sensitive and real-time
          evaluation of antibody binding to viral Spike, RBD and NC proteins. First, we demonstrated that SPR was
          indeed measuring antibody binding through the observed concordance between CLIA profile and viral protein
          binding association rates observed in our prospective cohort (eFigure 7 in the Supplement). Further, we
          observed that in-case of individuals where antibodies were below the level of detection in the CLIA assay (Y-
          axis value 0) detectable antibodies/plasma binding to SARS-CoV-2 proteins was apparent using SPR.
          We then proceeded to stratify plasma binding data (association rates) based on disease progression (eFigure 8
          in the Supplement) as well as IgM/IgG serostatus (Figure 3). In the case of the former we observed significant
          increases by day 7 for all 3 viral targets with increased responses against NC and RBD compared to Spike
          followed by steep declines of these responses in convalescent plasma.
          When grouped cross-sectionally by sero-status we observed (Figure 3), as would be expected, an increase in
          binding from the IgG-IgM- stage to the single positive, post class-switched stage (IgM-IgG+). Also, as
          observed in the smaller prospective cohort, association rates were higher for NC and RBD. For all three viral
                                                                                                                                         10

          proteins, these rates were significantly lower in convalescent individuals with presumably mature memory B
          cells and viral clearance.
          Having already demonstrated the importance of circulating IL-6 and sMAdCAM either in combination (sMIL
          index, Figure 2) or in isolation (Figure 1 and eFigures 5 and 6 in the Supplement) in influencing disease
          progression and anti-viral antibody production, we investigated the possibility of identifying a specific viral
          target (Spike, RBD or NC) whose binding response was associated and thus potentially attributable to these
          markers. Indeed, we were able to identify (Figure 4) a strong correlation between sMAdCAM levels and peak
          association rate of responses against the viral neutralization target, RBD in convalescent individuals. Also, we
          observed a relatively weaker but suggestive association with fold changes (day 0 and day 7) in sMIL index
          with that of viral Spike protein binding in plasma of the follow-up cohort.
          Discussion:
          Our study is the first to identify a putative integrated marker of inflammation and homeostatic immune
          migration that associates both with COVID-19 disease progression as well as generation of potentially
          neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2.
          Considering the already demonstrated role of inflammatory cytokines in the development of pathology of
          COVID-1912 we undertook to evaluate how inflammatory profiles (Th1/Th2/Th17) correlated both cross-
          sectionally as well as longitudinally with varying disease states. Further, the role of an important emerging
          mediator of gut inflammation and mucosal homing, sMAdCAM, was examined in light of its significant role
          in the pathology of chronic inflammatory conditions including those with viral aetiology11,13–15. This aspect of
          our study is especially noteworthy in the context of accumulating evidence for the gut as a potential sanctuary
          site for SARS-CoV-2 and persistent immunological sequelae observed in apparently virus free individuals16–
          18
             . Whether altered sMAdCAM levels reflect changes in migration to various mucosal sites (gut to respiratory
          mucosa and vice versa) in response to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection remains to be established. Additionally,
          its role in microbial translocation, a well-established pathology for viruses such as HIV19,20 and recently
          described in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be evaluated8.

          Our in-patient cohort included participants at various stages of disease progression and included a group of 11
          individuals where inflammatory profiles as well as anti-viral responses could be measured in a prospective
          manner relatively early after infection. These profiles were compared to a group of convalescent, disease free
          individuals that were presumed to have recovered from infection. We were also able to group study
          participants on the basis of anti-viral IgG and IgM responses which enabled a concurrent evaluation of
          inflammatory signatures with development of immune responses.
          Our cytokine data highlights and confirms the predominance of IL-6 as an inflammatory mediator of
          pathology early following infection evinced through declining levels that trended inversely both with disease
          progression as well as transitioning of double negative (IgM-IgG) to IgG single positive anti-viral responses.
          Together with TNF, it was interesting to note that similar dysregulated levels of these cytokines were
          observed in apparently ‘convalescent’ individuals that, in some cases, had been discharged following not just
          resolution of symptoms but also repeated negative RT-PCR diagnoses in respiratory swabs. These
          observations may prove useful in optimising screening procedures of donors for plasma therapy that are often
          drawn from a pool of convalescent individuals21, that as of now, are simply screened for the ability to mount
          anti-viral antibodies without accounting for sequelae such as ongoing inflammatory cytokine dysregulation.
          Also, stark differences in circulating IL-6, but not TNF levels were observed in male participants who
          exhibited higher levels of this cytokine. This observation is consistent with reports of milder pathology and
          faster recuperation following infection in women22–24. Further, the small size of our female cohort with
          heterogenous age (implying both pre and post-menopausal status) limited our ability to delineate a role for sex
          hormones in the relatively lower inflammatory signature observed in women enrolled in our study. However,
          it is interesting to note that a very tight grouping for IL-6 levels was observed in these women, irrespective of
          their age (range, 20-72 years; Median, 38 years).
          Our results with sMAdCAM are interesting, in light of the limited data available from select gut associated
          inflammatory pathologies,25–28 however, when stratified by disease state (in-patient or convalescent status) as
          well as by gender an intriguing trend for this marker was observed. Both convalescent individuals and
          females had significantly elevated levels of sMAdCAM and conversely lower levels of IL-6. This observation
          led us to investigate whether the relationship between these 2 markers reflected an inflammatory/homeostatic
                                                                                                                                         12

          dichotomy where favourable disease progression or convalescence was characterized by relative levels (or
          ratios) of these mediators. Indeed, our analysis, heretofore unreported, confirmed that only the ratio (but not
          levels in isolation) of sMAdCAM/IL-6 (sMIL index) was able to stratify infected individuals into varying
          disease states cross-sectionally, longitudinally, by gender and most importantly by immune competence as
          measured by class switched IgG anti-viral responses. Whether the sMIL index would serve as a similar
          correlate in other diseases involving inflammation and mucosal homeostasis remains to be evaluated.
          The apparent link between sMIL index and class switched antibodies detected in advanced disease
          progression and convalescent individuals drove us to characterize plasma borne anti-viral humoral responses
          in our cohort against multiple viral targets NC, Spike and RBD, that are significant for diagnosis and vaccine
          development29. Real-time binding profiles, through surface plasmon resonance (SPR), offered a more realistic
          recapitulation of in-vivo binding and were thus generated directly by flowing plasma over immobilized viral
          proteins. This analysis first revealed a good concordance between detected peak association rates (RU) of
          anti-NC responses and CLIA IgG indices obtained for the same target. Of note however is the observation
          that the SPR assay was able to detect binding against NC even in individuals that had undetectable levels as
          measured by CLIA, highlighting its possible utility as an early sero-diagnostic tool30,31.
          When comparing peak association rates (RUs) across disease progression (longitudinally) or disease states
          (in-patients and convalescents) responses to all 3 targets were clearly detectable by day 7 following diagnosis
          of infection. Also, convalescents uniformly had lower levels of these antibodies in circulation in keeping with
          their presumed viral clearance32. Overall, in concordance with previous reports for both SARS and SARS-
          CoV-2 using endpoint assays33,34, levels of anti-NC binding were detected early following infection, at high
          levels and appeared to be more persistent than those of anti-Spike responses. When stratified into groups
          reflecting maturation status of antibody responses (IgM/IgG status) we noticed gratifyingly that the relatively
          lower and less persistent anti-Spike responses could be explained by the observation that both anti-NC and
          RBD binding responses, but not anti-Spike responses were significantly observed at the IgM+IgG+ (double
          positive) stage suggesting earlier and probably better memory cell generation for these viral targets. We
          propose further exploration of these mechanisms may also help explain the observed rapid loss or waning to
                                                                                                                                         13

          undetectable levels of these antibodies in some convalescent individuals35,36 and also reported for SARS
          infection37.
          Finally, the observed correlation between sMAdCAM and sMIL index with peak anti-RBD RUs and fold
          change in anti-Spike responses respectively further confirm the association of apparently disparate arms of the
          immune response in generating anti-viral immunity and highlight the importance of inflammatory/mucosal
          homeostatic markers as putative positive immune correlates for efficacious vaccines38–41.
          Limitations: The limitations of this study include a modest sized cohort that may reduce the impact of the
          observations and requires validation through larger prospective studies. Also, the follow-up data was based on
          11 of 36 in-patients due to limited availability of sequential samples. With respect to sMAdCAM levels there
          is a lack of robust data for healthy individuals. Further, the date of diagnosis was considered as the onset of
          disease progression which may not have been the case for all the study participants.
          Conclusion:
          Our study is the first to report on the role for sMAdCAM in the pathology of and immunity against SARS-
          CoV-2 as well as on its utility together with IL-6 levels (sMIL index) in serving as an integrative disease
          progression marker for COVID-19.

          (A) Association of plasma MAdCAM levels with Peak RU (association rate) of RBD binding among
          convalescent study participants. (B) Association of fold change between Peak RU for spike and sMIL index
          among study participants (n=9 out of 11) who were followed up. Fold change was calculated by dividing Day
          7 values with those of Day 0. Fold change in Peak RU of 2 individuals could not be calculated as Day 0
          values were undetectable (zero). Correlation analysis performed using non parametric Spearman Rank
          Correlation test. r indicates strength of correlation, p indicates significance.
