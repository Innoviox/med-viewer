       Abstract
       Objective: To explore how different diets may affect human brain development and if genetic and
       environmental factors play a part.
       Design: Cohort study.
 5     Setting: UK Biobank data were collected from 22 centres across the UK.
       Participants: Only white British individuals free of Alzheimer's or dementia diseases were
       included in the study, where 336517 participants had quality-controlled genetic data, and 18879
       participants had qualified brain MRI data.
       Main outcome measures: Grey matter volume, intake of cereal and coffee, body mass index and
10     blood cholesterol level.
       Results: We investigated diet effects in the UK Biobank data and discovered anti-correlated brain-
       wide grey matter volume (GMV)-association patterns between coffee and cereal intake,
       coincidence with their anti-correlated genetic constructs. These genetic factors may further affect
       people's lifestyle habits and body/blood fat levels through the mediation of cereal/coffee intake,
15     and the brain-wide expression pattern of gene CPLX3, a dedicated marker of subplate neurons that
       regulate cortical development and plasticity, may underlie the shared GMV-association patterns
       among the coffee/cereal intake and cognitive functions.
       Conclusions: Our findings revealed that high-cereal and low-coffee diets shared similar brain and
       genetic constructs, leading to long-term beneficial associations regarding cognitive, BMI and other
20     metabolic measures. This study has important implications for public health, especially during the
       pandemic, given the poorer outcomes of COVID-19 patients with greater BMIs.
       Introduction
       Increases in human brain volume, due to growth, begin at an early stage of embryonic development
       and continue until late adolescence1. After this, the brain experiences a persistent but slow decrease
25     in size throughout adulthood2. Generally, development is tissue-specific but systematically
       organized across the brain2 3 and may be susceptible to both genetic and environmental influences2-
       6
         , as well as their interactions, e.g. through epigenetic modifications7. Diet is a common
       environmental factor that can influence the trajectory of brain size. For example, a lack of nutrients
       over an extended period of time causes both structural and functional damage to the brain8, and
30     improved diet quality is associated with larger brain volumes9. Furthermore, evidence suggested
       that ingested substances (both food and drink) in well-fed and healthy adults may also cause
       changes in brain size. For example, in a small-scale study, an increase in the size of the
       hippocampus was inferred to have occurred as an effect of both low and high coffee consumption10.
       While there are extensive studies of the degree to which different diets affect the body11-14, there
35     is an absence of systematic investigation into how different diets may affect the human brain in
       both the short and long term. Thus, it is not known if impacts of different diets on brain structures
       follow similar patterns, or whether different brain regions exhibit differential sensitivity to diet
       and other environmental factors. In addition, there is a lack of knowledge about whether genetic
       factors play any role in the sensitivity of the brain to environmental factors. In the present work,
40     we provide a detailed analysis of brain-size changes that occur in healthy adults due to the ingestion
       of different common foods and drinks to investigate whether these influences from diets were
                                                                          2

       systematically organized across the brain, whether these diets influences have underlying genetic
       factors, and whether these genetic factors have further implications in people's daily activities,
       metabolism and cognitive functions.
       Methods
 5     Study participants
       Study samples were from the UK Biobank study, a prospective epidemiological study that involves
       over 500,000 individuals in 22 centres across the UK15. Between 2006 and 2010, approximately
       9.2 million mailed invitations to participate in the survey were sent to people in the National Health
       Service registry who were aged 40–69 years and living < 25 miles from a study centre. Participants
10     were recruited to collect a range of questionnaires about detailed phenotypic information including
       diet, lifestyle, anthropometric and cognitive function assessments, biological samples, including
       blood and medical records obtained from the NHS registries. Since 2014, a subsample of the
       original population has been invited back to collect magnetic resonance imaging of body and brain,
       and questionnaires about diet, lifestyle, and cognitive function assessments.
15     In the current study, we used data collected at both recruitment and MRI scan. The original sample
       comprised 488289 individuals (56.54 ±8.09 years; 54.21% women). We included 431039 white
       British individuals and then excluded 810 individuals who were diagnosed with Alzheimer's or
       dementia defined by codes G30/F00 in the 10th edition of the International Classification of
       Diseases (ICD-10). Of the 430228 individuals, 336517 individuals had quality-controlled genetic
20     data, and 18879 individuals had available brain MRI data. Table S1 summarized relevant
       demographic information. Behavioural and neuroimaging data collection and protocol are publicly
       available on 15 16. All participants provided written informed consent to UK Biobank. Data access
       permission was granted under UKB application 19542 (PI Jianfeng Feng).
       Assessment of the intake of cereal and coffee
25     Dietary information was obtained from the touchscreen questionnaire at the baseline and the MRI
       scan appointment. Cereal intake was the number of bowls of cereal the participants consumed per
       week. The types of cereal included bran cereal, biscuit cereal, oat cereal, muesli, and other types
       (e.g., cornflakes, Frosties). Coffee intake was the number of cups of coffee the participants drank
       per day. The types of coffee included decaffeinated coffee, instant coffee, ground coffee, other
30     types of coffee. Detailed information can be found in supplementary materials.
       Assessment of lifestyle
       Lifestyle phenotypes included physical activity, sleep, smoking and alcohol and were obtained
       from the touchscreen questionnaire at the baseline appointment. Physical activities were assessed
       using MET (Metabolic Equivalent Task) scores derived based on International Physical Activity
35     Questionnaire) of total physical activity (including walking, moderate, and vigorous activity) and
       usual walking pace. The time spent watching television was also included to reflect physical
       activity. Sleep data included information for sleep duration, morningness or eveningness type,
       insomnia symptoms, daytime dozing, getting up in morning, and nap during day. Smoking status
       included smoking history and the number of cigarettes currently smoked daily. Alcohol intake was
40     examined using frequency and amounts of alcohol drinking. Detailed description can be found in
       supplementary materials.
       Assessment of cognitive functions
                                                                          3

       Cognitive function performances were examined at the baseline and the MRI scan appointment.
       The cognitive tests included fluid intelligence score, reaction time, numeric memory, pairs
       matching, prospective memory, matrix pattern completion, symbol digit substitution and trail
       making. Detailed descriptions of procedures can be found in supplementary materials.
 5     Assessment of body size and blood cholesterol
       Body mass index was calculated from the participant's measured weight (kg)/height (m2).
       Cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
       cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured in the blood sample collected at recruitment.
       Assessment of the Alzheimer's disease risk
10     We used a proxy phenotype for Alzheimer's disease (AD) case-control status derived from the
       genetic risk index for AD based on parents' diagnoses as suggested in a previous study17. The
       proxy phenotype ranged approximately from 0 to 2, with values near zero when both parents were
       unaffected (lower for older parents and possible values below zero if both parents were over age
       100) and values of two when both parents were affected.
15     COVID-19 test
       COVID-19 test results data are linked to UK Biobank by Public Health England (PHE). Data were
       available for the period 16th March 2020 to 3rd August 2020. Data provided included specimen
       origin (hospital inpatient indicating severe COVID-19 vs. other settings). Detailed information is
       available on the website (http://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/exinfo.cgi?src=COVID19_tests). To
20     focus on the COVID-19, we excluded individuals passed away except for those who had positive
       test results. There were 13145 unique test results available, of which 1649 (12.54%) were positive;
       10098 (76.82%) tests were conducted on inpatients; 1069 (639 had available data on BMI and diet)
       were inpatients and positive.
       Structural MRI preprocessing
25     Detailed structural MRI data collection and acquisition procedures can be found in supplementary
       materials. All UK Biobank structural MRI data were preprocessed in the Statistical Parametric
       Mapping package18 (SPM12) using the VBM8 toolbox with default settings, including the usage
       of high-dimensional spatial normalization with an already integrated Dartel template in Montreal
       Neurological Institute (MNI) space. All images were subjected to nonlinear modulations and
30     corrected for each individual head size. Images were then smoothed with a 6 mm full-width at
       half-maximum Gaussian kernel with the resulting voxel size 1.5mm3. The estimated total
       intracranial volume (TIV) covariate, were calculated as the summation of the grey matter, white
       matter, and CSF volumes in native space. The automated anatomical labelling 3 (AAL3) atlas19,
       which partitioned the brain into 166 regions of interest, was employed to obtain the total brain grey
35     matter volume and region-wise grey matter volume. 18879 T1 images were successfully
       preprocessed, and the grey matter volumes of the AAL3 atlas of the discovery sample were
       extracted. The majority of participants were assessed in the Cheadle MRI site (84.49%) and the
       rest in the Newcastle site (15.51%).
       Genetic data quality control
40     Detailed genotyping and quality control procedures of the UK Biobank can be found in
       supplementary materials or http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/. In this study, we performed stringent QC
       standards by PLINK 1.9020. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with call rates <95%, minor
                                                                          4

       allele frequency <0.1%, deviation from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium with p<1E-10 were
       excluded from the analysis. In addition, we selected subjects that were estimated to have recent
       British ancestry and have no more than ten putative third-degree relatives in the kinship table using
       the sample quality control information provided by UKB. For more details, we refer to the official
 5     document for genetic data of the UKB (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/scientists-3/genetic-data/).
       After the quality control procedures, we obtained a total of 616,339 SNPs and 336517 participants.
       Preprocessing of the Allen Human Brain Atlas data
       We followed the AHBA preprocessing pipeline suggested by Arnatkevic̆iūtė et al.21 and using the
       same pipeline as Shen et al.22, including probe-to-gene re-annotation, data filtering, probe selection.
10     In the next step, we separated the samples into the areas based on their MNI coordinates, using the
       automated anatomical labelling 3 (AAL3) atlas19 and excluding the samples located outside of the
       grey matter defined by this atlas. To control for the inter-individual differences, we conducted two
       within-donor normalizations. The expression data were first normalized within-sample and across-
       gene and then normalized across samples. One gene failed the normalization and therefore was
15     deleted, resulting in 15,408 genes. We used the mean expression of samples located in the brain
       region and the mean expression in the brain region of all subjects as the gene expression in each
       brain region defined by AAL3 atlas19.
       Linear regression analysis
       We conducted linear regression analysis to test the pairwise associations between the diet
20     phenotypes and the total and regional grey matter volume (GMV), respectively. The covariate
       variables included were age at imaging scan, sex, imaging sites (dummy variable), and total
       intracranial volume (TIV).
       To further understand the biological insights of the shared variants of cereal intake and coffee
       intake, we performed linear regression analysis to examine the pairwise associations between the
25     independent lead SNPs and other diets, lifestyle, and body/blood fat covarying age, sex, the top 40
       genetic principal components. We also performed linear regression analysis to examine the
       pairwise associations between the cereal/coffee intakes, other diets, lifestyle, and cholesterol
       covarying age, sex.
       Genome-wide association analysis and annotation of significant variants.
30     We performed genome-wide association analysis adjusting for age, sex, and the top 40 ancestry
       principal components using PLINK 1.9020 to assess the association between phenotype and
       genotype on cereal intake and coffee intake separately. After association analysis, we employed
       the FUMA23 online platform (version 1.3.6, http://fuma.ctglab.nl/) to define genomic risk loci. The
       GWAS summary statistics was submitted as input. FUMA identifies significant variants with P
35     value less than 5E-8 that were largely independent of each other (r2 < 0.6). Based on the clumping
       of the independent significant variants (r2 < 0.1), independent lead variants were obtained.
       Shared lead SNPs of cereal and coffee were mapped to genes based on cis-eQTL (p value≤ 0.05)
       in the brain using database GTEX24 v8 with FUMA23. The eQTL mapping assigned SNPs to genes
       up to 1Mb apart.
40     Heritability and genetic correlation estimation
       The LDSC software (https://github.com/bulik/ldsc) was employed to estimate the heritability of
       cereal intake and coffee intake as well as their genome-wide genetic correlation25. We used the
                                                                          5

       pre-calculated LD scores using 1000 Genomes European data. We used the overlap of summary
       statistics variants and HapMap variants as recommended25.
       Mediation analysis
       Mediation effects were examined using Baron and Kenny's (1986)26 causal steps approach. The
 5     causal steps approach involved four steps to establishing mediation. Firstly, a significant relation
       of the independent variable to the dependent variable is required in 𝑌 = 𝑘! + 𝜏𝑋 +
       𝜀! ( 𝑟𝑒𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝐻" : 𝜏 = 0 ). Secondly, a significant relation of the independent variable to the
       hypothesized mediating variable is required in 𝑍 = 𝑘# + 𝛼𝑋 + 𝜀# ( 𝑟𝑒𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝐻" : 𝛼 = 0). Thirdly,
       the mediating variable must be significantly related to the dependent variable when both the
10     independent variable and mediating variable are predictors of the dependent variable in 𝑌 = 𝑘$ +
       𝜏′𝑋 + 𝛽𝑍 + 𝜀$ (𝑟𝑒𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝐻" : 𝛽 = 0) Fourthly, the coefficient relating the independent variable to
       the dependent variable must be larger (in absolute value) than the coefficient relating the
       independent variable to the dependent variable in the regression model with both the independent
       variable and the mediating variable predicting the dependent variable ( 𝑖. 𝑒. |𝜏| > |𝜏′|). To further
15     evaluate the p-value of the significant mediation identified by the above process, we performed
       1000 times bootstrap of the individuals to obtain the distribution of the proportion of the mediation,
       i.e., 𝑃𝑀 = (|𝜏| − |𝜏 % |)/|𝜏|, under the alternative hypothesis. Thus, the PM was expected to be
       positive by definition, and the corresponding p-value could be calculated as the doubled chance of
       observing the PM less than zero during the 1000 bootstrap procedure. As no priory assumption
20     about whether diet or lifestyle/ blood and body fat levels should serve as the mediator for their
       associations with the lead SNPs, we, therefore, identified the most likely mediator with an excess
       PM, i.e., the model showing higher PM, of which the significance level was again evaluated
       through a 1000-bootstrap process.
       Pattern similarity analysis
25     We examined the similarity among the brain-wide GMV-association patterns of cereal/coffee
       intake and cognitive functions. Specifically, we first performed association analyses between
       region-wide GMV and each phenotype. Then, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient
       (similarity) between the GMV-association patterns of a pair of phenotypes of interest, of which
       the significance level was evaluated through 10000 times permutation that shuffled the individual's
30     IDs of the GMV data at each iteration.
       The similarity between brain-wide GMV-association pattern of a given phenotype and the brain-
       wide gene-expression pattern was also examined through their pattern correlation, of which the
       null distribution was established through 10000 times permutation that at each iteration, the pattern
       correlation was re-calculated with the GMV-association patterns been regenerated with shuffled
35     IDs of the GMV data. The corresponding p-values were hence calculated as the chance of
       randomly getting a higher pattern correlation than the observed one in terms of their absolute value
       based on the established null distribution. The above permutation process was employed to ensure
       that the potential oversampling of brain regions will not inflate the false positive rate.
       Patient and public involvement
40     We used anonymised data collected by UK Biobank study. No patients were involved in setting
       the research questions or the outcome measures.

       Association between grey matter volume and diets
       We first investigated the relationship between grey matter volume (GMV) and 17 different diet
       phenotypes, which were both measured at the second visit (i.e. at follow-up) of participants to a
       research center15. We found that the total grey matter volume of the brain (TGMV) is affected by
 5     diet. Some dietary items were negatively correlated with the TGMV, thus decreasing consumption
       of these items had the tendency to increase the TGMV, while other items were positively correlated,
       and had the opposite tendency on the TGMV. With a statistically significant correlation (P<0.05
       Bonferroni corrected), intake of coffee, water, processed meat, beef, lamb/mutton and pork were
       found to be negatively correlated with TGMV, while intake of cereal and dried fruit were positively
10     correlated with TGMV (see Table S2). We note that predated measurements (i.e., baseline
       measurements) of cereal and coffee intake were also related to the follow-up values of TGMV
       (Table S3), and these remained significant even after controlling for the corresponding follow-up
       intakes (Table S4). This indicates a persistent, rather than a short-term connection between diet
       and GMV. Table S5 and S6, based on an alternative way of measuring TGMV, obtained similar
15     results, confirming the methodological stability of the above findings.
       Correlations were further investigated between 17 diet phenotypes and the volumes of 166 brain
       regions defined by the automated anatomical labelling 3 (AAL3) atlas19. A total of 454 statistically
       significant correlations (Bonferroni correction: P<0.05/166/17) were found, again mainly between
       GMV and intake of cereal, coffee, water, dried fruit, processed meat, beef, pork and lamb/mutton
20     (Fig.1.A and Table S2). It is interesting to note that the GMV-association pattern of cereal intake
       highly resembles, although in the opposite direction, the GMV-association pattern of coffee intake
       (pattern correlation across the whole brain: r=-0.6177, Pperm<1E-04 based on 10000-permutation;
       Fig.1.B).
       Genome-wide association studies for the intake of cereal and coffee
25     We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for the intake of both cereal (n=335696)
       and coffee (n=335068) at baseline and identified 21 and 45 independent lead genome-wide
       significant variants with P<5E-08 (i.e., the lead SNPs) respectively (Fig.2, Table S7&S8 and
       fig.S1). A linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression27 analysis indicates that both findings were
       free from systematically inflated false-positive rates, e.g., due to population stratification, with
30     intercepts of 1.013 (cereal intake) and 1.005 (coffee intake), and the corresponding SNP-based
       heritabilities were estimated as 0.0652 (se=0.0038) and 0.0618 (se=0.007) respectively.
       Furthermore, we observed a significant negative genetic correlation between intake of cereal and
       coffee (rg=-0.233, se=0.052, z-score=-4.49, P=7.1E-06), i.e., the alleles associated with higher
       cereal intake were likely to be in association with reduced coffee intake, which is in line with the
35     above GWAS findings, where the three shared lead SNPs, i.e. rs2504706, rs4410790 and
       rs2472297, were found in associations with both cereal and coffee intake, again in opposite
       directions (Table S9).
       The minor C-allele at rs2504706 was associated with a higher intake of cereal (regression
       coefficient 0.058, 95% confidence interval 0.042 to 0.073, Tdf=334441=7.30, P=2.94E-13) and a
40     lower intake of coffee (regression coefficient -0.034, 95% confidence interval -0.045 to -0.023,
       Tdf=333816=-6.03, P=1.67E-09). The minor C-allele at rs4410790 was associated with lower intake
       of cereal (regression coefficient -0.038, 95% confidence interval -0.052 to -0.024, Tdf=334331=-5.47,
       P=4.40E-08) and higher intake of coffee (regression coefficient 0.120, 95% confidence interval
       0.110 to 0.130, Tdf=333705=24.37, P=4.71E-131). The minor T-allele, at rs2472297, was associated
                                                                          7

       with lower intake of cereal (regression coefficient -0.059, 95% confidence interval -0.074 to -0.044,
       Tdf=334951=-7.84, P=4.38E-15) and higher intake of coffee (regression coefficient 0.142, 95%
       confidence interval 0.131 to 0.152, Tdf=334321=26.55, P=4.20E-155). While rs4410790 and
       rs2472297 have both been previously associated with coffee/caffeine consumption28-30, caffeine
 5     metabolism31, and alcohol consumption32, this is the first study to identify an association with
       cereal intake. It is notable that SNPs rs4410790 (the C-allele) and rs2472297 (the T-allele) were
       also strongly associated with higher intake of tea (regression coefficient 0.111, 95% confidence
       interval 0.098 to 0.123, Tdf=332509=17.04, P=4.58E-65 for rs4410790; regression coefficient 0.148,
       95% confidence interval 0.134 to 0.162, Tdf=333124=21.03, P=3.82E-98 for rs2472297, respectively)
10     and lower intake of water (regression coefficient -0.075, 95% confidence interval -0.085 to -0.065,
       Tdf=331879=-14.64, P=1.65E-48; regression coefficient -0.086, 95% confidence interval -0.097 to -
       0.076, Tdf=332497=-15.62, P=5.53E-55, respectively) (Fig.3.A and Table S10), although both intakes
       were not observed with significant long term impacts on the TGMV (Table S4). This result is
       remarkable because there is a median to large anti-correlation between the intake of coffee and tea
15     (r=-0.359, regression coefficient -0.472, 95% confidence interval -0.477 to -0.468, Tdf=332711=-
       221.65, P<1.0E-256), which is likely due to the seesaw effect given the limited amount of
       beverages one may consume each day. Thus, individuals with both SNPs (i.e., C-allele of
       rs4410790 and T-allele of rs2472297) might generally prefer flavoured beverages to the water.
       Association between genetic variants, diets and lifestyle
20     As both cereal and coffee intake, as well as their shared lead SNPs, were associated with different
       lifestyles, such as the frequency of physical activity (R=0.016, P=2.52E-17 for cereal and R=-
       0.011, P=3.23E-09 for coffee), being a morning/evening person (R=-0.040, P=2.57E-104 for
       cereal and R=0.032, P=3.05E-69 for coffee) and the frequency of alcohol use (R=-0.101, P<1.0E-
       256 for cereal and R=0.050, P=5.77E-184 for coffee) (Fig.3A and Table S11 & S12), we then
25     investigated possible mediation roles of diet or/and lifestyles on their associations with SNPs. As
       no prior assumptions about whether diet or lifestyle should serve as the mediator for their
       associations with the lead SNPs, we evaluated the most likely mediator, based on the
       corresponding proportion of mediation (PM) that they are responsible for (see the Supplementary
       Material for more details). We found the following:
30     1) Both intake of cereal and coffee were likely to mediate the positive association of the frequency
       of alcohol intake with the T-allele of rs2472297 (PM=24.75%, Pbootstrap=5.47E-15 and PM=38.14%,
       Pbootstrap=1.37E-82 respectively; Table S13); these were superior to alternative mediation models
       with the frequency of alcohol intake as the mediator (excess PM>20% with Pbootstrap<0.002 for both
       alternative models, Fig.3.B and Table S13; see supplementary materials for detailed analyses);
35     2) The association between higher T-alleles of rs2472297 and less daytime sleeping was mediated
       by cereal intake (PM=1.98%, Pbootstrap=2.82E-6; Fig.3.B and Table S13), which was superior to the
       alternative mediation model with daytime sleeping as the mediator (excess PM=1.39% with
       Pbootstrap=0.018, Table S13; see supplementary materials for detailed analyses);
       3) Both difficult in rising and less daytime sleeping were found to mediate the negative association
40     of cereal intake with the C-allele of rs4410790, so did the alternative mediation models with the
       cereal intake as the mediator. However, neither group of mediation models was superior to the
       other (Table S13);
       4) Interestingly, while individuals with rs2504706 (the C-allele) were more likely to be an 'evening
       person' and experience difficulties in rising, both lifestyle traits did not mediate the associations of
                                                                          8

     (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

       the SNP with higher cereal intake or lower coffee intake (nor did the alternative mediation models),
       which was mainly due to nonconcordant correlations, e.g., a positive correlation was observed
       between ease in rising and higher cereal intake while a negative one was expected (Fig.3.A and
       Table S9, S11 & S12).
 5     Association between genetic variants, diets and metabolic measures
       In addition to lifestyle, both cereal and coffee intake, as well as their shared lead SNPs, were also
       associated with blood (for example with total cholesterol, R=-0.066, P<1.0E-256 for cereal and
       R=0.045, P=1.89E-139 for coffee) and body fat levels (for example with the body mass index
       (BMI), R=-0.076, P<1.0E-256 for cereal and R=0.053, P=3.84E-206 for coffee) (Table S14, Table
10     S15). Therefore, we further explored possible mediator roles of fat levels and the intake of cereal
       and coffee. We found the following:
        1) Associations between rs4410790 (C-allele) and: an increased body mass index (BMI),
       triglycerides and decreased HDL cholesterol, were mediated by increased coffee intake
       (PM=35.31%, Pbootstrap=1.41E-81, PM=3.30%, Pbootstrap=1.04E-5, and PM=3.09%, Pbootstrap=2.28E-
15     4, respectively), which were superior to the alternative mediation models with corresponding fat
       levels as mediators (excess PMs=34.48%, 3.10% and 2.95%, respectively; all corresponding
       Pbootstrap<0.002) (Table S16);
       2) Associations between rs2472297 (T-allele) and higher body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol,
       and LDL cholesterol, were mediated by higher coffee intake (PM=27.71%, Pbootstrap=6.72E-83,
20     PM=25.14%, Pbootstrap=6.82E-68 and PM=28.92%, Pbootstrap=4.65E-75, respectively), as well as by
       lower cereal intake, to a lesser extent (PM=11.46% for total cholesterol, Pbootstrap=6.51E-14 and
       PM=8.56% for LDL cholesterol, Pbootstrap=1.80E-13). The above models were superior to
       alternative mediation models with corresponding fat levels as mediators (for the coffee intake:
       excess PMs=26.66%, 24.38% and 28.13%, respectively, with all corresponding Pbootstrap<0.002;
25     for the cereal intake: excess PMs=7.54% and 5.83%, respectively, with all corresponding
       Pbootstrap<0.05) (Table S16).
       Related to the current COVID-19 pandemic, using the UK Biobank data we found that individuals
       who tested positive of COVID-19 (n=639, inpatients only) had higher BMIs (Cohen’s D=0.27,
       t=6.72, P=1.86E-11) and lower cereal intake (Cohen's D=-0.09, t=-2.36, P=0.019) than the rest
30     population (n=314982, either tested negative or not tested). This further highlights the importance
       of our finding for public health that cereal intake is associated with lower BMIs.
       Associations between the GMV-association patterns of cognitive functions and the GMV-
       association patterns of the intake of cereal and coffee
       To further characterize the negatively correlated brain-wide GMV-association patterns for cereal
35     and coffee intakes, we further investigated if such similarities have any implications for cognitive
       functions, and we found that brain-wide GMV-association patterns of most cognitive functions
       were significantly correlated with those of both cereal and coffee intake, although in opposite
       directions, at both baseline and follow-up (GMV were measured at follow-up only). In particular,
       performance in tasks of matrix pattern completion, symbol digit substitution, and numeric and
40     alphabet-numeric trail making showed similar brain-wide GMV-association patterns with both
       cereal (in positive correlation) and coffee (in negative correlation) intake at both baseline and
       follow-up (|R|min=0.5945, all PFDR<0.05; Fig.4 and Table S17&S18), while the fluid intelligence
       score only showed a similar brain-wide GMV association pattern with the cereal intake (at both
                                                                          9

       baseline and follow-up; Rmin=0.62, all PFDR<0.05; Table S17&S18). In line with the above findings,
       higher risk of Alzheimer's disease (estimated as the proxy-AD 17), characterized by reduced
       cognitive functions, was associated with reduced cereal intake (R=-0.009, P=3.42E-6), as well as
       increased coffee intake to a much lesser extent (R=0.004, P=0.024), in contrast to previous findings
 5     of either protective33 or non-significant34 effect of high coffee intake on Alzheimer's disease.
       Associations between the GMV-association patterns of the cereal/coffee intake and the gene-
       expression patterns of eQTL genes
       We further investigated if the identified putative genetic variants may also contribute to observed
       similarities of brain-wide GMV association patterns between diet and cognitive function, through
10     the expression of candidate genes. We first performed eQTL mapping of the 3 lead SNPs using
       software FUMA23 and identified 31 candidate protein-coding genes (Table S19) that also have
       brain-wise gene expression information from the Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS)35. After
       also mapping to the AAL3 atlas, the brain-wide expression pattern for each candidate gene (i.e.
       the mean expression level across all AIBS individuals for each brain region) was then correlated
15     with the brain-wide GMV association patterns for cereal and coffee intakes. While multiple
       candidate genes had their brain-wide expression pattern in significant correlation with brain-wide
       GMV associations patterns for the coffee intake (Table S19), only gene CPLX3 showed significant
       'gene-expression vs GMV-association' pattern similarity with both intakes of cereal (R=0.47,
       Pperm=2.9E-3, PFDR-corrected=0.033 ) and coffee (R=-0.44, Pperm=7.2E-3, PFDR-corrected=0.046). It is of
20     particular interest that the gene-expression of CPLX3 (a known prominent marker that is specific
       for subplate neurons that regulate cortical development and plasticity across the brain 36-38 and also
       respond to both light and electrical stimuli in retinal neurons 39 40) also showed significant pattern
       correlations with almost all cognitive functions (i.e., R=0.42 for fluid intelligence, R=0.49 for
       numerical memory, R=0.44 for prospective memory, R=0.46 for matrix pattern completion,
25     R=0.39 for symbol digit substitution, and R=0.44/R=0.55 for both trail making tasks; all
       corresponding PFDR-corrected<0.05; Table S20).
       Discussion
       In the large-scale imaging/genetics analysis presented in this work, we have: (i) gained insights
       into long-term associations between brain-wide GMV and diets, especially the anti-correlated
30     impacts from cereal and coffee intake, (ii) identified shared genetic constructs for both higher
       cereal and lower coffee intake, and explored the complex relationship among cereal/coffee intake,
       their genetics constructs, lifestyle, and body/blood fat level, (iii) revealed shared brain-wide GMV-
       association patterns between cognitive function and the intake of cereal and coffee and further
       showed that such similarity might be underlaid by the brain-wide expression patterns of gene
35     CPLX3, a shared genetic determinant identified for the intake of cereal and coffee. These novel
       findings hence suggest the existence of a brain-wide systematic organization of GMV that is
       susceptible to both genetic and environmental influences, which may have further impacts on
       people's lifestyles, cognitive functions, and metabolic measures (e.g. BMI and blood cholesterol
       level).
40     Comparisons with other studies
       Two lead SNPs shared by the intake of coffee and cereal, i.e. rs4410790 and rs2472297, have been
       previously associated with coffee/caffeine consumption28-30, caffeine metabolism31, and alcohol
       consumption32. However, this is the first study to identify their associations with cereal intake.
                                                                          10

       Moreover, while CPLX3, within the LD complexity around the lead SNP rs2472297 along with
       90 other genes (based on R package "biomaRt"41), has previously been proposed as a candidate
       gene for both coffee consumption42 and blood pressure43, it is the first time that this gene has been
       linked with multiple cognitive functions, such as intelligence, as well as with cereal intake.
 5     Remarkably, the expression of CPLX3 is a highly specific marker of subplate neurons 36 that
       regulate cortical development and neuronal plasticity across the brain 37 38. Specifically, while most
       subplate neurons were short-lived during the development of the brain, previous studies have
       shown that the Cplx3-positive subplate neurons could survive into adulthood in mice 36. Therefore,
       our findings were not only congruent with the role of subplate neurons in the cortical development,
10     but with further implications that these CPLX3-positive subplate neurons might mark the dynamic
       system of GMV in the brain that is susceptible to environmental factors. Such a hypothesis could
       be supported by previous findings that Cplx3 protein's regulation of exocytosis in mice retinal
       neurons could be altered by both light and electrical stimuli 39 40.
       Limitations of the study
15     UK Biobank only includes participants aged 40 and above. Therefore, some of our results may not
       necessarily reflect the situation in the younger population, although the GWAS findings are highly
       consistent with previous literature across different age bands, which may help to alleviate such a
       concern. In addition, further studies are still needed to fully understand the molecular and
       metabolic pathways involved in the systematic alternation of GMVs in the brain, as well as its
20     influences on cognitive function and metabolism.
       Conclusion
       Since high cereal diets, but low coffee diets, have long-term beneficial associations regarding the
       brain, cognition, BMI and other metabolic measures, this study has significant implications for
       public health. Our findings highlight the importance of a 'cereal' breakfast across the life span, but
25     perhaps especially for children and adolescents whose brains are still in development and for
       reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease and poor outcomes due to high BMIs in patients with
       COVID-19 44 45.
