19    Abstract (135 words)
20    Severe acquired respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of
21    coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In severe COVID-19 cases, higher antibody titers against
22    seasonal coronaviruses have been observed than in mild cases. To investigate antibody
23    cross-reactivity as potential explanation for severe disease, we determined the kinetics,
24    breadth, magnitude and level of cross-reactivity of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal CoV
25    nucleocapsid and spike from 17 severe COVID-19 cases at the clonal level. Although patients
26    mounted a mostly type-specific SARS-CoV-2 response, B-cell clones directed against
27    seasonal CoV dominated and strongly increased over time. Seasonal CoV IgG responses that
28    did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 were boosted well beyond detectable cross-reactivity,
29    particularly for HCoV-OC43 spike. These findings support a back-boost of poorly protective
30    coronavirus-specific antibodies in severe COVID-19 patients that may negatively impact de
31    novo SARS-CoV-2 immunity, reminiscent of original antigenic sin.

32    Introduction (892 words)
33    The introduction of the zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-
34    2) has led to a pandemic of acute respiratory tract disease termed COVID-191. The majority
35    of COVID-19 patients experience mild symptoms including fever, sore throat, cough, dyspnea,
36    anosmia, ageusia and myalgia, none of which can be considered specific to this infection2. In
37    some patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with
38    prolonged disease course requiring treatment at an intensive care unit (ICU) and resulting in
39    a high mortality rate2–4.
40             Risks for developing ARDS and poor disease outcome are older age and factors
41    consistent with immune activation5. Correlates of protection for severe COVID-19 are not
42    defined in humans but antibodies likely are important. However, there is concern that
43    suboptimal antibody responses may also be detrimental for COVID-19 outcome6. The
44    possibility of immune-mediated disease has been raised as a major concern for SARS-CoV-2
45    infection and an important consideration is the infection history and resulting immunological
46    background against seasonal coronaviruses (CoV)6,7. A lack of knowledge on specific features
47    of the induced host response to SARS-CoV-2 in ARDS patients hampers the development of
48    targeted treatment to prevent or overcome severe disease 5. Therefore, there is an urgent
49    need for detailed insight in the SARS-CoV-2 immune response in the context of a CoV-
50    experienced immune system.
51             For other viruses, several mechanisms have been described on how pre-existing
52    immunity to antigenically related viruses affect the outcome of infection. First, for influenza
53    and dengue viruses the immunological imprint of the initial infection dominates the host
54    response towards subsequent related infections for life 8,9. This mechanism, termed “original
55    antigenic sin” (OAS), relates to the propensity of adaptive immunity to preferentially fight
                                                                                                                                  3

56    pathogens based on memory recall. Consequently, clones primed to target a specific epitope
57    may dominate the response to target a new slightly different cross-reactive epitope and have
58    reduced affinity and functionality, e.g. a poor neutralization potential for the new infection8–
      10.
59        Moreover, OAS has also been linked to a delayed or weakened initiation of a new type-
60    specific response10.
61             Second, for influenza virus increased antibody titers targeting viruses far beyond the
62    response against the first encountered antigen alone were observed11,12. The observed boost
63    in neutralization titers was stratified on antigenic seniority, with highest titer increase
64    towards more senior antigens12. Also, a broad “back boost”, extending beyond cross-
65    reactivity, after infection or vaccination has been shown11,13. This phenomenon has not yet
66    been described for any other viral infection but may have strong implications for vaccine
67    design and the response to infection. Although a back-boost by vaccination may be useful to
68    maintain broad immunity to preceding strains, it may negatively affect the development of a
69    newly induced immune response, similar to OAS9–11.
70             Structural homology between the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S, SARS2-SECTO) or
71    nucleocapsid protein (N, SARS2-N) with those of other endemic human seasonal CoV such as
72    hCoV-229E, -NL63, -HKU1 and -OC43 or recent epidemic strains such as SARS-CoV and Middle-
73    East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) suggests that memory B-cells capable of
74    expressing cross-reactive antibodies may pre-exist in patients14,15. This is exemplified by the
75    cross-reactive antibody response towards SARS-CoV-2 in SARS-CoV infected individuals due
76    to high sequence homology (88.6% shared amino acids in N and 69.2% in S)14,16. Structural
77    homology between SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal CoV is lower17, yet these viruses are highly
78    prevalent16. Repeated exposure to seasonal CoV may therefore also substantially contribute
79    to developing a SARS-CoV-2 reponse18.
                                                                                                                                  4

 80             A strong SARS2-N and SARS2-S IgM and IgG response is mounted in the vast majority
 81    of infected individuals targeting the receptor binding domain (S RBD), the outer- (S1) and inner
 82    domains (S2) to various extent19. In severe COVID-19 cases this response is dominated by IgG
 83    targeting the S2 domain16,19. There was no evidence of substantial IgG cross-reactivity towards
 84    SARS-CoV-2 in healthy controls16,19. In contrast, COVID-19 patients displayed elevated serum
 85    IgG titers against the majority of seasonal CoV N and S antigens which suggests that the IgG
 86    responses against these viruses are correlated by undefined mechanisms. Strikingly, high
 87    serum OC43-SECTO IgG titers are associated with COVID-19 disease severity, which might be
                                                                                             16,17.
 88    related to stretches of amino acid sequence homology in S2                                     Together, these studies
 89    suggest that high antibody titers to seasonal CoV may associate with poor disease outcome
 90    in COVID-19 patients and support the hypothesis that the immunological background is key.
 91    A limitation of serological studies is that monoclonal IgG cross-reactivity patterns cannot be
 92    defined and the functional contribution of seasonal CoV-specific IgG clones to immune
 93    protection or immunopathogenesis remains largely unknown.
 94             At the clonal level, it was shown that pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive IgG
 95    memory B-cells predominantly target the SARS-CoV-2 S2 with limited virus neutralization (VN)
 96    potential20. Besides a shared epitope that has been described in S2 of SARS-CoV-2 and OC4321,
 97    little is known on seasonal CoV IgG cross-reactivity patterns with SARS-CoV-2 and their
 98    functional contribution. Pre-existing CoV-specific B-cells may provide protection from SARS-
 99    CoV-2 infection by rapid production of cross-reactive antibodies that aid in viral clearance,
100    e.g. by a faster rise of cross-neutralizing antibodies from memory recall compared to initiating
101    a primary humoral response22,23. However, based on observations in other viral infections,
102    pre-existing immunity may also promote pathology7.

103             Here, we longitudinally enumerated and categorized type-specific and cross-reactive
104    circulating B-cell clones targeting an array of N and S antigens from a broad selection of
105    human CoV in order to gain insight in immune kinetics, magnitude, breadth and function
106    towards SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
107
108    Methods (485 words)
109    Patient characteristics and clinical specimen
110    PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients24 admitted to the ICU at the Erasmus Medical Center with
111    acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were included in a biorepository study (MEC-
112    2017-417) and samples were analyzed according to the SARS-CoV-2 protocol (MEC-2020-
113    0222) with approval from the medical ethical committee of the Erasmus MC. Personal or
114    deferred informed written consent was obtained after recovery or from a legal
115    representative, partner or family member of the participant respectively, all in compliance
116    with the Declaration of Helsinki. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were
117    isolated from EDTA vacutainer blood collection tubes (BD biosciences) aliquoted and
118    cryopreserved as described elsewhere25. Weekly serum and EDTA blood samples for PBMC
119    isolation were collected where the initial sample was collected within 2 days after admittance
120    to the ICU until patients were released from the ICU. From patients 1–6, samples from the
121    first three weeks were included in this study for longitudinal analysis. Additional serum
122    samples from later time points were included in the study if available. Additionally, 11 cross-
123    sectionally sampled COVID-19 patients were selected based on differential clinical outcome
124    of infection. Six succumbed to, and five recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 1).

126    B-cell profiling
127    B-cells were isolated from cryopreserved PBMC using the EasySep human CD19 positive
128    selection kit (Stem Cell technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Oligoclonal
129    cultures of 100-300 CD19+ B-cells per well were seeded in 96 wells U-bottom plates in AIM-V
130    AlbuMAX medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin (all
131    Invitrogen) and -mercaptoethanol (Sigma) (B-cell medium). Oligoclonal B-cell cultures were
132    stimulated using 1000 L-CD40L cells that were growth arrested by 40Gray -irradiation, 50
133    U/ml IL-2 (Novartis), 10 ng/ml IL-10 (Peprotech), 25 ng/ml IL-21 (Peprotech) and 1 µg/ml R848
134    (Invivogen) for 48 hours and subsequently cultured for 12 days in B-cell medium
135    supplemented with 25ng/ml IL-21. Culture supernatants were harvested and reactivity of
136    secreted IgG was determined using protein microarray analysis.
137
138    Protein micro-array analysis
139    Reactivity of secreted IgG in oligoclonal culture supernatants towards an array of CoV N and
140    S proteins was analyzed using protein microarray analysis (PMA) as described elsewhere 26.
141    Paired sera of the respective PBMC samples were included in the analysis. Microarray slides
142    were scanned using a Powerscanner (Tecan, Switzerland). Background was determined for
143    each spot and mean fluorescence intensity signal (MFI, range 1 – 65,000) of two spots was
144    calculated for each serum or culture supernatant. For B-cell culture supernatants a cut-off
145    was set at 1,000 MFI for all antigens based on the highest signal of non-reactive cultures.
146    Serum IgG titers were calculated using 4-parameter logistic regression with inflection point
147    as titer27.

149    Virus neutralization assays
150    Virus neutralization was determined by plaque reduction neutralization titers as previously
151    described17.
152
153    Statistical analysis
154    Serum IgG and virus neutralization titers and mean fluorescent intensity values of protein
155    microarray analysis were 2Log transformed for regression analysis. P-values below 0.05 were
156    considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using ‘R’ and Graphpad Prism
157    7 as previously described18,27.

159    Results (1896 words)
160    Clinical characteristics of study participants
161    Seventeen severe COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS were included in this
162    study, shortly after being admitted to the ICU or the Erasmus MC, Rotterdam (Table 1). From
163    six patients we included three or more longitudinal samples. All patients were tested RT-PCR
164    positive for SARS-CoV-2 and required mechanical ventilation during their stay at ICU. Five
165    females (mean age = 67.2y, range = 54-75y), and 12 males were included in the study (mean
166    age = 59.9y, range = 29-77y). Five patients died, nine recovered and three were transferred
167    to different hospitals for further treatment. Thirteen out of seventeen patients suffered from
168    one or more comorbidities, of which hypertension (n=6), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=5),
169    were the most common. Nine patients experienced thrombotic complication during their stay
170    at the ICU (Table 1).

172    Serum IgG titers towards a broad range of coronavirus N and S antigens increased after SARS-
173    CoV-2 infection in severe COVID-19 patients
174    All patients mounted a strong SARS-CoV-2 immune response shown by rising IgG titers against
175    SARS2-SECTO, SARS2-S1 and SARS2-SRBD which peaked around 4 weeks post onset of clinical
176    symptoms (Figure 1A and Supplementary figure 1A for individual patients). These patients
177    were assumed never exposed to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Nevertheless, there was a strong
178    IgG response towards all SARS-CoV antigens. Given the high structural similarities between N
179    and S of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-216,28, likely a cross-reactive response was mounted. The
180    increase in MERS-SECTO IgG, but not MERS-N and MERS-S1 IgG and highest amino acid
181    homology within S2 with SARS-CoV-2 suggested this cross-reactive response targeted MERS-
182    S2 17.
183             Besides the SARS-CoV-2 IgG response, serum IgG reactivity towards various, but not
184    all seasonal CoV antigens, increased in longitudinally analyzed COVID-19 patients (Figure 1A
185    and Supplementary figure 1A). All patients showed IgG reactivity towards at least one of the
186    229E, NL63, HKU1 or OC43 antigens (Supplementary figure 1A). Potential IgG cross-reactivity
187    in serum responses refutes any firm conclusions on previous exposure against these CoV. For
188    S, OC43-SECTO IgG titers were immunodominant at inclusion in all six patients and titers

196    were stimulated oligoclonally in vitro at a limiting density that was empirically tested to give
197    a clonal B-cell response. Supernatants were individually screened for IgG reactivity towards
198    all available CoV antigens using PMA. The number of reactive B-cells was normalized for the
199    number of screened B-cells in order to compare frequencies between different samples
200    (Figure 1B). Overall, the frequency and total reactivity of in vitro stimulated peripheral blood-
201    derived B-cells was representative for the total serum IgG reactivity (Figure 1B and
202    supplementary figure 1B). Similar to serum IgG reactivity, all patients showed a strong
203    increase in SARS-CoV-2 reactive B-cells and the number of B-cell clones reactive towards
204    various seasonal CoV antigens increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the frequency
205    of HKU1-N reactive B-cells was higher than expected based on the low serum reactivity.
206    Potentially, this difference reflects a different level of B-cell activation in vitro and in vivo. The
207    linear outgrowth of B-cells reactive towards OC43-SECTO, SARS-SECTO, SARS2-SECTO, SARS2-S1
208    and SARS2-SRBD displayed strikingly similar kinetics in their response (Figure 1C).
209
210    Coronavirus type-specific and cross-reactive IgG clones increased during SARS-CoV-2 infection
211    The outgrowth of B-cells that do not target SARS-CoV-2 antigens is potentially related to
212    cross-reactivity. Therefore, we analyzed the multiplex PMA profiles of in vitro stimulated B-
213    cell cultures to address the level of cross-reactivity of monoclonal IgG. Profiles of CoV antigen-
214    reactive cultures are shown for a representative patient (patient 4, Figure 2). N-reactive
215    clones from this donor showed substantial cross-reactivity between 229E-N, NL63-N and
216    HKU1-N at all time points (Figure 2A). Although individual clones with aberrant cross-
217    reactivity can be identified in these patients, we hypothesize these contribute little to the
218    overall IgG response. A Pearson correlation test was used to calculate the strength and
219    robustness of cross-reactivity between each pair of antigens to identify cross-reactivity
                                                                                                                                 10

220    patterns that significantly contribute to the induced immune response (Figure 2B). The level
221    of cross-reactivity as calculated by Pearson correlation test varied slightly over time due to
222    the limited number of clones per sample. Overall, the cross-reactivity patterns between 229E-
223    N, NL63-N and HKU1-N became more apparent and statistically more significant when all
224    clones from three time points (n=125) are combined for analysis (Figure 2B). OC43-N and
225    MERS-N clones displayed no cross-reactivity and cross-reactivity between SARS-N and
226    seasonal CoV was considered non-substantial (Figure 2A/B).
227             S-reactive IgG clones showed an increasing mostly SARS-CoV-2 type-specific response
228    with increasing numbers of detected SARS2-SECTO and SARS2-S1 B-cell clones. Strong SARS2-
229    SECTO and SARS2-S1 cross-reactivity indicated that mostly shared epitopes within S1 were
230    targeted in this patient (Figure 2C and D). The frequency and number of detected SARS2-SRBD
231    clones remained more or less stable, yet cross-reactivity towards SARS2-SECTO and SARS2-S1
232    increased over time suggesting maturation of the SARS-CoV-2 specific response. The initial
233    lack of cross-reactivity of SARS2-SRBD towards SARS2-SECTO and SARS2-S1 suggested that the
234    epitope(s) targeted by the SARS2-SRBD clones at day 9 were sterically hindered or displayed in
235    an alternative conformation in the larger SARS-CoV-2 S proteins on PMA (Figure 2C). The
236    increasing cross-reactivity suggests clones that target epitopes displayed on the outer surface
237    of S are naturally selected.
238             Strikingly, there was a dominant OC43-SECTO-specific response that increased over
239    time. This response significantly cross-reacted with HKU1-SECTO and SARS-SECTO, but not
240    SARS2-SECTO (Figure 2D). This suggests the outgrowth of OC43-SECTO clones is not driven by
241    SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactivity. The limited cross-reactivity between OC43-SECTO and OC43-S1
242    suggested these clones predominantly target S2. The correlated response between the paired
                                                                                                                                 11

243    S1 and SECTO antigens of NL63-, HKU1-, MERS-, SARS- and SARS-CoV-2 validated availability of
244    shared epitopes in both antigens.
245             The total number of detected SECTO-reactive clones (n=363) outnumbered S1-reactive
246    clones (n=85) and showed greater cross-reactivity between different CoV compared to the S1.
247    These data suggested clones targeting S2 are immunodominant and more cross-reactive in
248    this donor.
249             For the other five longitudinally analyzed donors, similar patterns were observed with
250    i) high levels of cross-reactivity between 229E-N, NL63-N and HKU1-N but not SARS-N and
251    MERS-N ii) a mostly SARS-CoV-2 type-specific response that strongly increased over time, iii)
252    an OC43-S2-specific response that increased over time with limited cross-reactivity towards
253    SARS-CoV-2. Notably, the N-reactivity of 1/6 patients showed increased cross-reactivity
254    between OC43-N and other seasonal strains (Supplementary figure 6). OC43-SECTO-specific B-
255    cells were immunodominant in 3/6 patients (Supplementary figure 1B) and the S2 response
256    was immunodominant in 2/6 patients (Supplementary figures 2–6).

258    N-IgG selectively cross-reacted between seasonal coronaviruses while S-IgG showed complex
259    cross-reactivity patterns involving all strains
260    In order to determine the overall pattern of IgG cross-reactivity between N and S of different
261    CoV in severe COVID-19 patients we pooled all available N (n=2039, Figure 3A) and S-reactive
262    IgG clones (n=2699, Figure 3B) from all 17 included donors. For N, Pearson correlation analysis
263    validated that 229E-N, NL63-N and HKU1-N IgG clones most substantially cross-reacted (range
264    R=0.52 – 0.72, all p<0.0001, Figure 3C). Additionally, weak yet highly significant correlations
265    between OC43-N and other seasonal CoV strains were observed (range R=0.066 – 0.14, all
266    p<0.003). Conversely, no significant cross-reactivity was detected between seasonal and
                                                                                                                                 12

267    emerging CoV indicating different epitopes to be involved for these recent zoonotic strains
268    (Figure 3C).
269             The combined analysis of all S-IgG clones showed complex cross-reactivity patterns,
270    including endemic seasonal and epidemic zoonotic strains (Figure 3D). All SARS-CoV and SARS-
271    CoV-2 S antigens positively correlated (range R=0.14 – 0.80, all p<0.0001). Additionally, all
272    corresponding S1 and SECTO antigens positively correlated (range R=0.35 – 0.80, all p<0.0001)
273    validating availability of shared epitopes in paired antigens for all CoV strains.
274             Our cohort showed there was broad cross-reactivity within S1 between 229E-, NL63-,
275    HKU1- and OC43-CoV but not MERS-CoV. For MERS-CoV significant cross-reactivity was
276    restricted to SECTO, suggesting cross-reactive epitopes are mostly located in S2 (Figure 3D).
277
278    Correlated clonal IgG reactivity patterns showed in vivo expansion of OC43-SECTO specific B-
279    cells beyond detectable cross-reactivity
280    Given the synergistic outgrowth of OC43-SECTO and SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive B-
281    cells in severe COVID-19 patients (Figure 1C) one would presume that SARS-CoV-2 cross-
282    reactivity drives in vivo expansion of OC43-SECTO-specific B-cells. However, cross-reactivity
283    between OC43-SECTO and SARS-CoV-2 S antigens showed significant weak negative
284    correlations (range R=-0.038 – -0.088, range p=4,7x10-6 – 0.014) suggesting that OC43-SECTO
285    specific clones are unlikely to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 S in severe COVID-19 patients
286    (Figure 3B). Indeed, the majority of OC43-SECTO clones (752 out of 920 clones, 82%) did not
287    cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 indicating these were initiated prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
288    Due to lack of a pre-sample we cannot draw firm conclusions on pre-existence of SARS-CoV-
289    2 cross-reactive clones in this cohort.

290             Longitudinal analysis of OC43-SECTO clones in all 17 patients, grouped per week number
291    post onset of symptom showed the average relative number of clones that cross-reacted with
292    SARS-CoV-2 S antigens showed a moderate increase over 4 weeks (13 – 21%). The OC43-SECTO-
293    reactive clones that cross-reacted increasingly recognized epitopes in SARS2-S1 and SARS2-
294    SRBD indicating there was natural selection of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive clones specific for the
295    outer S domains (Figure 4).
296
297    No evidence for functional contribution of OC43-SECTO-specific IgG in virus neutralization
298    To determine what CoV-specific IgG functionally contribute to clearing SARS-CoV-2 infection
299    via virus neutralization (VN) we correlated serum S reactive IgG to serum SARS-CoV-2 VN
300    titers. All SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S antigens selectively positively correlated with serum
301    SARS-CoV-2 VN titers but none of the other CoV S antigens. This is congruent with SARS-
302    CoV/SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactivity patterns and other studies showing that S is the dominant
303    antigenic target of neutralizing clones29,30. Notably, no correlation was detected between VN
304    and serum OC43-SECTO and OC43-S1 IgG titers (Figure 5A).
305             To determine what circulating S-specific B-cells contribute to VN, the normalized S-
306    reactive B-cell counts were correlated with paired serum SARS-CoV-2 VN titers. Similar to
307    serum IgG titers, SARS2-SECTO, SARS-S1 and SARS2-S1 correlated with serum VN titers.
308    Contrasting to serum titers, OC43-S1 B-cell numbers showed a positive correlation with VN.
309    Notably, the relatively low frequency of OC43-S1-reactive B-cells (<0.01% of screened B-cells)
310    suggested the potential functional contribution of these clones to VN in vivo was limited.
311    Contrasting to serum IgG, SARS2-SRBD B-cell counts did not reach significance in correlation
312    with VN titers (p=0.13), which may be related to the limited number of samples analyzed
313    (n=22). Notably, neither OC43-SECTO-specific serum IgG nor circulating specific B-cells
                                                                                                                                 14

317    Discussion (1276 words)
318    Multiplex IgG analysis of culture supernatants of in vitro activated B-cell cultures at limiting
319    dilutions allowed us to i) categorize strain-specific from cross-reactive monoclonal IgG, ii)
320    distinguish pre-existing clones targeting seasonal CoV from newly induced SARS-CoV-2-type
321    specific and cross-reactive clones, iii) perform in-depth analysis of humoral immune kinetics
322    in severe COVID-19 patients. Together with paired serological analysis these data gave
323    detailed insight in the magnitude, breadth and cross-reactivity patterns of the SARS-CoV-2
324    induced immune response in severe COVID-19 patients.
325             Severe COVID-19 patients displayed an evolving SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG response that
326    correlated with the increasing SARS-CoV-2 neutralization potential of serum during disease
327    progression. Additionally, these patients displayed a strong rise of pre-existing seasonal CoV-
328    specific clones that did not correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers, which is suggestive
329    of OAS. Based on this mechanism, one would expect that cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2
330    would drive outgrowth of pre-existing seasonal CoV-specific B-cells. However, here we
331    observed a strong outgrowth of clones that selectively targeting seasonal CoV. Using Pearson
332    regression analysis, we were able to distinguish rare from substantial cross-reactivity
333    patterns. Although clones were identified that showed SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactivity, these had
334    a minor contribution to the overall SARS-CoV-2 response.
335             For N, very limited cross-reactivity was observed between seasonal and emerging CoV
336    strains. Even though we could not confirm this for SARS-CoV-2, the high level of SARS2-N and
337    SARS-N sequence homology (88.6%) and reported strong correlation between serum SARS2-
                                                                                                                                 15

338    N and SARS-N IgG titers16 suggests SARS-N may be used as a proxy of SARS2-N. This suggests
339    the outgrowth of 229E-N, NL63-N and HKU1-N reactive IgG clones was not selectively driven
340    by cross-reactivity.
341             The outgrowth of seasonal CoV-reactive B-cell clones was most striking for OC43-SECTO.
342    OC-43-SECTO-reactive clones outnumbered others in the majority of patients and showed a
343    synergistic outgrowth with the SARS-CoV-2-reactive B-cells. Of OC43-SECTO reactive clones
344    only a minor fraction cross-reacted with OC43-S1 (66 out of 920 clones, 7%). This suggests the
345    majority of OC43-SECTO clones target S2, which corresponds with previous studies16,21. The
346    fraction of OC43-SECTO clones that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 was limited (168 out of 920
347    clones, 18%) but for the clones that did, reactivity was increasingly directed towards SARS2-
348    S1 and SARS2-SRBD and not S2. As IgG targeting S1 and SRBD confer the strongest VN potential,
349    these OC43-SECTO clones contribute to evolving SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG response23,31.
350             OC43-S2 clones potentially have low-affinity reactivity towards SARS-CoV-2, that is
351    below the detection limit of protein microarray, which drives expansion of OC43-SECTO clones.
352    This is of interest because low affinity antibodies, with consequentially a poor neutralizing
353    potential, can mediate engagement of Fc receptors (FcRs) on innate immune cells and
354    promote viral entry through a mechanism termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).
355    This may either result in productive infection and increased viral spread – this was shown for
356    flaviviruses32 – or promote inflammation and tissue damage, as was described for SARS-
357    CoV33–35. However, the level of OC43-SECTO clones that cross-react with SARS2-S2 remained
358    stable over time, as determined by the OC43-SECTO clones that selectively cross-react with
359    SARS2-SECTO (Week 1, 7%; week 2, 4 %; week 3, 4% and week >4, 5%). If OC43-SECTO clones
360    were selectively expanding due to undetected low affinity cross-reactivity, one would expect
361    that clones that have detectable cross-reactivity to have a growth advantage. The reason for
                                                                                                                                 16

362    this is that the clonal selection of B-cells is driven by the affinity of the B-cell antigen receptor
363    and SARS-SECTO-specific TH-cell-mediated linked recognition of antigens, the presence of which
364    has been confirmed in an largely overlapping patient cohort25.
365             We find no evidence of a functional contribution of OC43-SECTO reactive IgG to SARS-
366    CoV-2 VN. OC43-S1 specific clones did correlate with SARS-CoV-2 VN titers although these
367    clones represent only a minor fraction of OC43-CoV specific clones. While it is possible that
368    OC43-SECTO specific IgG restrict viral replication by indirect mechanisms, they may also play
369    no role, or even have a detrimental effect by delaying the development of a type-specific
370    response or by enhancing immune pathology36. The previously reported selective association
371    of increased OC43-SECTO IgG reactivity in severe versus mild COVID-19 patients supports a
372    potential role in immunopathology16. Unfortunately, the limited volume of B-cell culture
373    supernatants was insufficient to perform in-depth analysis of their affinity or function at the
374    clonal level and deserves follow-up studies.
375             Alternatively, the outgrowth of clones with reactivity towards the highly seroprevalent
376    seasonal strains may relate to a general immune activation induced by a hyper-inflammatory
377    state of the immune system37. However, for individual patients, not all CoV-reactive B-cells
378    show similar outgrowth after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the low serum IgG
379    reactivity towards HKU1-N and relatively high frequency of HKU1-N-reactive clones suggests
380    these B-cell are not activated in vivo. Together, these data do not support this hypothesis.
381             Overall, our data suggest that cross-reactivity towards SARS-CoV-2 has a minor
382    contribution to the outgrowth of clones targeting seasonal CoV and vice versa. The boosted
383    response involves a broad range of seasonal CoV strains. For influenza virus, the gradual
384    antigenic evolution allows preceding exposures to different virus strains to be chronologically
385    ordered to determine antigen seniority12. For seasonal CoV, the order and time window at
                                                                                                                                 17

386    which individuals were infected or reinfected cannot be deferred. Potentially, the strong and
387    dominant OC43-SECTO response observed in severe COVID-19 patients relates to antigenic
388    seniority, but this cannot be confirmed. Regardless of the unknown timeline of preceding
389    infections, the outgrowth of seasonal CoV-specific clones is similar to the back-boost that was
390    initially described for influenza11. Here, using antibody landscapes of hemagglutination
391    inhibition titers it was shown that infection or vaccination induced a broad increase in titers
392    towards preceding viruses11,13. Based on the antigenic distance it was calculated that the back
393    boost extended beyond cross-reactivity11,13. However, this mechanism was never validated
394    by antigen binding at a clonal level or shown for any other infectious agents. To our
395    knowledge, we present the first data on a back boost of IgG clones towards a different virus
396    family and substantiate this mechanism with clonal reactivity.
397             For influenza, back-boost is considered to have a positive contribution to vaccine
398    response by helping maintain immunity towards a broad range of influenza viruses and
399    allowing improved coverage by preemptive vaccination updates 11. Contrastingly, in OAS,
400    clones initiated by prior infections are shown to negatively impact de novo type-specific
401    response and worsen clinical outcome8–10,13,38. Whether the SARS-CoV-2-specific response is
402    hampered by back-boost of seasonal clones, similar to what has been described for OAS, is of
403    interest. Immune dominance of IgG reactivity towards seasonal CoV and the late peak SARS-
404    CoV-2 response in these severe COVID-19 patients, 4 weeks after onset of clinical symptoms,
405    suggests the initiation of the SARS-CoV-2 response may be hampered by proliferation of
406    seasonal CoV-specific clones.
407             In summary, the detailed insights in kinetics and cross-reactivity patterns of N and S-
408    reactive IgG presented in this study will aid in the interpretation of serological assays and
409    expands our understanding of how the humoral immune system responds towards a novel
                                                                                                                                 18

410    CoV. Also, it shows that studies on in-depth functional characterization of the boosted or
411    newly induced antibody clones after SARS-CoV-2 infection, e.g. VN and ADE assays, are
412    warranted. These data are critical to identify correlates of protection and drivers of
413    immunopathology for COVID-19 and may provide key insights for efficacy and safety testing
414    of future vaccines. Furthermore, the back boost of seasonal CoV IgG shows the immunological
415    background of individuals needs to be considered as an important factor in assessing the
416    quality and quantity of a newly initiated response towards SARS-CoV-2, either by infection or
417    vaccination.

546    panels) and significance (bottom panels) between N-reactivity of specific B-cell clones shows
547    the level of cross-reactivity at weekly intervals and the clones of all time points combined. C)
548    Heatmaps and D) regression analysis of SECTO, S1 and SRBD reactive IgG clones from the same
549    patient is shown. Positive correlations (green shades) show clones likely cross-react, negative
550    correlations (orange shades) show clones are likely to not cross-react. Significant associations
551    are shown in red shades (p<0.05).

553    Figure 3. Combined analysis of reactive clones from all donors shows cross-reactivity
554    patterns between human seasonal and emerging coronaviruses. Reactivity of N (n=2039)
555    and S-reactive IgG clones (n=2699) identified in 17 severe COVID-19 patients was analyzed.
556    A) Heatmaps show the relative amount (top panel, grey shades) and number of IgG clones
557    reactive towards at least one (top left to bottom right diagonal) or two N antigens and the
558    relative frequency of cross-reactivity towards these antigens (bottom panel, purple shades,
559    numerator is shown in clone count heatmap, denominator is indicated on x-axis). B) Relative
560    amount and number (left panel) and frequency (right panel) of S-cross-reactive IgG clones. C)
561    Pearson regression analysis of 2039 N reactive clones shows significant cross-reactivity
562    between all human seasonal coronaviruses. D) Regression analysis of 2699 SECTO, S1 and SRBD
563    reactive IgG clones shows broad cross-reactivity between human seasonal and emerging
564    coronavirus strains.

575    Figure 5. Serum IgG titers or normalized B-cell counts reactive towards OC43-S1, SARS-
576    SECTO/S1 and SARS2-SECTO/S1 correlate with serum SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization titers, but
577    not OC43-SECTO. A) Linear correlation between 2Log transformed serum IgG and SARS-CoV-2
578    virus neutralization (VN) titers shows that only SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike-reactive IgG
579    associate with VN. Horizonal dotted line shows the background of the assay. B) Normalized
580    counts of B-cells specific for SARS-SECTO, OC43-S1, SARS-S1 and SARS2-S1 selectively correlate
581    with VN. 22 Serum samples and corresponding B-cell cultures of 17 patients were included in
582    these analyses. Solid line depicts the best-fit regression coefficient. Dashed line shows the
583    95% confidence of the best-fit line.
