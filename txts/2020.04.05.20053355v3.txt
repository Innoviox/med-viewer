   Introduction: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are used
   to test for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. RT-PCR tests are highly specific and the
   probability of false positives is low, but false negatives are possible depending on the
   individual, swab type and timing as infection progresses. ​Objectives: To determine how the
   false negative test probability in infected patients depends on the time since symptom onset
   and swab type. ​Methods: We use General Additive Mixed Models to analyse publicly
   available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as
   SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once. ​Results: We identify that the probability of a positive
   test decreases with time after symptom onset, with oropharyngeal [OP]samples less likely to
   yield a positive result than nasopharyngeal [NP] ones. We also comment on the likely false
   negative rates in cohorts of patients who present for testing at different clinical stages and
   assess the robustness of these estimates to the probability of false positive tests.
   Conclusion: NP samples are more sensitive than OP samples. The later an infected
   individual is tested after the onset of symptoms, the less likely they are to test positive. This
   has implications for identification of infected patients, contact tracing, and also for the
   discharge of convalescing patients who are potentially still infectious. There is an urgent
   need for data from asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals.

   Introduction
   Currently, most SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals are identified by successful amplification of
   the virus from throat or nasal swabs in the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR) assay. These tests are highly specific but there are many reasons why sensitivity
   is imperfect ​[1]​. Indeed, multiple studies have observed negative RT-PCR results on at least
   1 occasion for SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals ​[1–8]​. Such false-negative results have
   implications for correct diagnosis ​[9] and subsequent community transmission ​[10]​, and thus
   for control initiatives, not only during emergence but also in any subsequent waves of
   transmission. For example, even in countries in Europe and Asia where outbreaks now
   seem to be under control, it remains unclear what fraction of the population has already
   been exposed and therefore the extent to which there remains the potential for large
   outbreaks following the reintroduction of the virus. Successful attempts to test and trace
   resurgent outbreaks will require a proper understanding of how test results alone cannot
   confirm or deny that an individual is infected with the virus, but also need to be taken in
   context with the other available information (such as the timing and type of test performed).


   A series of previous studies have described cohorts of tested individuals. Ai and colleagues
   [2]​, for instance, retrospectively considered 1014 infected patients of whom 413 (41%) tested
   negative by RT-PCR at initial presentation. Xie et al. ​[1] similarly considered 167 infected
   patients of whom 5 (3%) tested negative by RT-PCR at initial presentation. Fang et al. ​[3]
   found that RT-PCR was only able to identify 36/51 (71%) of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients
   when using swabs taken 0-6 days after the onset of symptoms. Liu et al. ​[8]​Zhao et al. ​[7]
   have demonstrated that the proportion of positive tests among infected patients dropped with
   each week since the onset of symptoms, and Luo et al. ​[11] reported that the initial
   sensitivity of throat swabs in secondary contacts was 71%. Meanwhile in a study of 213
   patients, Yang et al. ​[4] found lower positive test rates from throat swabs (24%) compared to
   nasal swabs (57%).


   Although these particular studies relate to longitudinal testing of infected patients, the data is
   not disaggregated per patient. Some authors have however presented sequential test data
   from individual patients ​[5,6,12]​. Here we use the latter type of data to characterise how the
   probability of a false-negative test result depends on the number of days between the onset
   of symptoms and the performance of the test, and how this is affected by the site from which
   swabs are taken. We also estimate the number of false-negatives in different cohorts of
   tested individuals, under the assumption that they are only tested once; and assess the
   sensitivity of these results to the specificity of the test. Our results have implications for both

   existing estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and the likelihood of correctly identifying the
   infected status of an individual, where these rely solely on RT-PCR tests.



   Methods

   Data sources

   Data for all sources were read directly from figures. To qualify for inclusion, studies had to
   report extractable results for longitudinal RT-PCR tests from individual patients who tested
   positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least once. The timing of swab collection had to be stated as the
   number of days after the patient became symptomatic. We identified seven studies that met
   these criteria and reported nasopharyngeal swab results ​[5,12,14–18] with two also reporting
   results for oropharyngeal swabs in the same patients ​[5,12]​. Several studies with longitudinal
   patient data ​[6,19,20] only vaguely described the sampling location (e.g. “upper respiratory
   tract”) or did not make clear which results belonged to which patient. Other types of sample -
   such as sputum and saliva - were not considered as the collection methods were different to
   swabs. These 7 studies provided data from 786 tests on 95 patients for nasopharyngeal and
   oropharyngeal swabs. Summary information about the included studies is presented in Table
   1.

   Data analysis: Estimating RT-PCR sensitivity

   Data were analysed using binomially-distributed (logit-link) generalised additive mixed
   models (GAMM) with the package mgcv ​[21] in the statistical software R version 3.6.3 ​[22]​.
   We tested hypotheses that the probability of a positive result will change through time after
   symptom onset, that different swab type may have different detection probabilities and that
   each study may have a different baseline detection probability (due to, for example, differing
   testing procedures). The effect of the number of days since symptom onset was modelled as
   a continuous smooth function (cubic regression splines), while swab location and data
   source were included as two-level categorical variables. Random effects were included in
   the form of patient-specific smooth functions, modelling between-patient differences in the
   probability of returning a positive test through time. All of the models we examine included
   this random effect, as patient samples were pseudo-replicated by design. Models were
   compared in a stepwise down procedure from the most complex structure using Akaike
   Information Criterion (AIC). The difference in AIC values (ΔAIC) values were calculated in
   relation to the lowest AIC value. Detailed methodology is available in Supplementary File 1.

   symptoms follows a gamma distribution with shape 2.12 and rate 0.39 (see Figure 3 and
   Table S2 in ​[13]​). We can use this together with our results on RT-PCR sensitivity and apply
   Bayes’ Theorem to recover the distribution of the time from onset of symptoms to getting
   tested (see Supplementary File 1l), which ends up as a distribution with a heavier tail (than
   the original gamma distribution) because the false-negative test probability increases with
   time.


   If we assume further that this distribution is generally representative and does not vary over
   the course of the epidemic, we can use it to estimate how many infected individuals are
   incorrectly identified as uninfected among a group of symptomatic tested individuals who are
   only tested once. We can further explore how the false-positive test probability affects these
   estimates and illustrate this using the numbers of tests performed and positive test results
   from the UK and South Korea as of 20th March 2020 (UK: 5.1% positive [3277 / 64621
   positive tests]; SK: 2.7% [8652 / 316664 positive tests] ​[16]​). It is important to stress that this
   exercise is illustrative rather than assertive: we show how accounting for the false-negative
   and false-positive test probabilities affects the estimate of the number of infected individuals
   among those tested, taking broad assumptions (e.g. all individuals only tested once; that the
   distribution to test is as we have assumed; that all those tested are symptomatic) any or all
   of which is likely to be violated in these datasets. Therefore, we do not make specific
   predictions but are rather presenting a sensitivity of scale for the overall impact of accounting
   for the false-negative and false-positive test probabilities.

   Results
   Our most complex model included two fixed effects (a smooth effect of day and a different
   intercept for each swab type) as well as a random intercept for each study and each patient
   (model AIC = 805.79). Removing the random intercept for study was supported (AIC =
   805.31, ΔAIC = -0.47), suggesting that the baseline probability of detection was consistent
   across different cohorts, test targets and sample processing procedures. Excluding swab

   type was not supported (AIC = 813.15, ΔAIC = 7.83), nor was excluding the effect of days
   since symptom onset (AIC = 974.30, ΔAIC = 168.99). The final model structure with the
   highest support contained the fixed effect of swab type, the effect of time since symptom
   onset and a random intercept for each patient. The full model output is given in the
   Supplementary File 1.


   Swabs taken from the throat immediately upon symptom onset were predicted to be 5.64%
   less likely to yield a positive result than a nasal swab (logit-scale effect size -1.00 CI [-1.54,
   -0.46]). The probability of a positive test decreases with the number of days past symptom
   onset: for a nasal swab, the percentage chance of a positive test declines from 96.40%
   [90.98, 98.6] on day 0 to 75.47% [66.88, 82.51] by day 10 and only a 3.30% [0.53, 17.90]
   chance of a positive result by day 31; for throat swabs the probabilities were 90.76% [77.84,
   96.52], 53.00% [38.27, 67.46] and 1.23% [0.18, 7.86] for day 0, 10 and 31 respectively. The

   Visualising the impact of time to test on false-negative test probabilities

   As shown above, the probability of a false-negative test result depends on the number of
   days since symptom onset. This means that simple reports of positive and negative test
   counts among individuals who are only tested once will underestimate the true number of
   positive tests in a cohort. We can illustrate the potential impact this has on average
   false-negative test probabilities by supposing that the time from onset of symptoms to testing
   follows a gamma-distribution.

   Figure 2 explores how varying the shape and rate of this distribution affects the average
   false-negative test probability in a cohort, and highlights that in scenarios where infected
   individuals are typically tested late, the false-negative test probability can be 4 times larger
   than when patients are typically tested early. We also show how the probability of incorrectly
   identifying an individual as uninfected due to a false-negative test considerably reduces if all
   negative tests are repeated 24 hours later. We note that the realised error rate (the actual
   proportion of false negative tests) will be proportional to the underlying prevalence of
   infection; only if everyone in the cohort is infected would the probability of a false negative
   equal the proportion of negative tests (as there will be no true negatives from uninfected
   individuals).

   distribution and the y-axis the standard deviation. The left-hand panel shows the error rate for one test, while the

   illustrative examples at the 4 extremes. ​A gives a scenario where most patients are tested early but with a

   with a similarly long tail. Scenarios ​C and ​D ​represent scenarios where patients are consistently tested early or
   late (with very thin tails).


   Estimating the number of false-negatives in a cohort of tested individuals

   We further demonstrate how the results of Figure 2, together with assumptions about the
   false-positive test probability, might affect testing outcomes in practice.

   of the false-negative test probability from nasal swabs, assuming false-positive tests are impossible (see
   Supplementary File 1).


   Figure 4 shows that when the false-positive test probability is very small then the estimated
   number of infections among those tested is increased by around 30%, but this estimate
   decreases linearly as the false-positive test probability increases. In fact, for some critical
   (yet small) value for the false-positive test probability, there will be more false-positives than
   false-negatives. Moreover, the false positive test probability has a bigger impact when the
   percentage of the original tests that were positive is smaller (this follows directly from the
   underlying derivations - see Supplementary Methods in Supplementary File 1).

   positive tests conducted as of 20th March 2020. ​(B) ​Similar, but now showing the percentage change from the
   number of positive tests to the estimated number of cases.


   Overall this illustrates 3 important things: that for a zero or very small false-positive test
   probability, the true number of infected individuals among those tested will be substantially
   larger than the number of positive tests; that increasing false-positive test probabilities
   decrease these estimates until they eventually go negative (even for quite small values of
   the false-positive test probability); and that such decreases are more severe in situations
   where the apparent prevalence among those tested is lower.



   Discussion
   Testing from single throat or nasal swab by RT-PCR is not guaranteed to yield a (true)
   positive result for SARS-CoV-2 infection and this probability decreases with time since the
   onset of symptoms. In other words, the longer the time from the onset of symptoms until a
   suspected case is tested, the more likely a false-negative result. Repeat testing of suspected
   but RT-PCR negative infections may not always be feasible, but our results suggest that
   repeat testing drastically decreases the chances of failing to identify infected individuals.


   Meanwhile, failing to account for the possibility of false-negative tests potentially biases
   upwards many of the existing estimates for case and infection fatality rates of SARS-CoV-2
   e.g. where they rely on perfect sensitivity among international travellers ​[24,25]​.


   We also show how even small false-positive test probabilities can have an opposite impact
   on any assessment of the “true” number of infections in a tested cohort and hence bias case
   and infection fatality risk estimates in the opposite direction. Better understanding of the
   false-positive test probability and accounting for precisely when and how individuals have
   been tested would therefore improve the quality of any estimates that rely on the number of
   positive tests in a cohort of tested individuals.


   Our results have important implications for SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies. Presently,
   RT-PCR testing regimes vary significantly between countries, determined both by policy
   decisions, testing capacity and perceived incidence. Some countries opt (or, rather, are able)
   to test large portions of the population, including those who are asymptomatic or
   self-isolating with mild symptoms. In countries such as South Korea, where testing has been
   thorough ​[26,27]​, the distribution of test timing is crucial: if many of those tested were
   infected some time ago but only had mild or asymptomatic infections (and therefore did not
   present for treatment), they will be more likely to return a false negative result. In countries
   that do not currently have mass testing, there are calls for testing to be expanded to the

                                                                                                                               8

   population at large with the aim of determining how many people carry, or have recently
   carried the virus. While RT-PCR testing of key workers is of great importance (particularly
   those working with vulnerable groups), our results suggest that there may be little benefit to
   testing indiscriminately; in fact, conducting a single test on someone who had symptoms 10
   days ago will have a nearly 25% chance of being a false negative (using a nasal swab; 47%
   for a throat swab). As a means of determining population level exposure to SARS-CoV-2,
   serological tests of known specificity and sensitivity are far more likely to provide an accurate
   profile (if these are known, then recovery of the likely level of population exposure is
   possible, even if it is not possible to determine which individuals have been exposed. This,
   however, would assume that all those infected will go on to develop and maintain detectable
   serological responses, which may not always be the case in e.g. mild infections, or across all
   age groups ​[28–33]​).


   In almost all countries, tests will be conducted on patients presenting with symptoms at a
   hospital in order to streamline treatment and prevent further infection. We do not suggest
   that the problem of false negatives is under appreciated by medical professionals; it is
   presently recognised by both the guidelines from the World Health Organisation (WHO) ​[34]
   and the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) ​[35] that a single negative test is
   insufficient to rule out infection, with discharge criteria stating that a patient should only be
   released if two repeat tests return negative results. Early in the outbreak, clinicians used
   chest CT to look for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients who returned a
   negative result, minimising the risk of false negatives ​[2,36]​.


   We also note that RT-PCR tests will return positive results even if the virus is inert - only by
   culturing the sample is it possible to verify that a patient is actually infectious. To date, the
   available information suggests that it is possible for individuals with mild disease to shed for
   at least 18 days ​[37] and those with severe disease for at least 20 ​[19]​; but evidence is
   mounting that successful culture of virus is associated with high viral loads and perhaps also
   not yet having a detectable serological response ​[6,19,38]​. Further characterisation of these
   important relationships is required, but it suggests that quantitative estimates of (still
   detectable) viral load and/or seroconversion could be used as tools to safely discharge
   infected individuals from quarantine or hospital ​[19]​. In light of this evidence, our study
   cannot readily assist with such decisions not least because the higher false-negative test
   probabilities we report with time since symptom onset are themselves almost certainly
   related to lower viral loads with time; what would be more useful would be quantitative
   estimates of how viral load changes with time since symptom onset. Repeat measurements
   and calculation of viral load in infected individuals would allow more precise interpretation of
   RT-PCR results, specifically whether a “negative” or high cycle threshold (CT) result is

   consistent with the previous trend in that patient, or is anomalous, and so determine how
   likely the individual is to still be infectious. Modelling efforts could help enormously on this
   topic, but in the meantime our results suggest that multiple negative tests would be
   consistent with the viral load having reduced to a sub-infectious level, but a single negative
   test may only represent a spurious test result.


   Major implications of our results relate directly to contact tracing of infected individuals.
   Since it is possible for infected individuals to test negative for infection even soon after the
   development of symptoms, this means that a single negative test alone is also insufficient for
   ruling out infection in their recent contacts, who may have already been infected and be
   currently in the latent phase or a- or pre-symptomatic themselves. It may therefore be
   prudent to assume that contacts of suspected infected individuals may be infected
   themselves and isolate and regularly test them until either there is firm evidence that the
   putative index case was not actually infected (or at least infectious) at the time of the
   contact, or assess if the incubation period for the contact has passed without evidence that
   the contacts have themselves been infected. Doing so would enhance infection control and
   also ultimately provide more detail on test sensitivity at all possible stages of infection.


   In conclusion, we demonstrate how the sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay for detecting
   SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the time from the onset of symptoms in symptomatic
   individuals, and show how nasal swabs appear more sensitive than throat swabs. In the
   absence of other testing procedures, this has implications for clinical decisions about
   treatment, and control / contact tracing decisions about who needs to be quarantined or can
   be released safely into the community. We also illustrate how, assuming that the false
   positive test probability is negligible, the count of positive tests underestimates the count of
   infected individuals in a cohort of tested individuals, which in turn has implications for
   estimates of case and infection fatality rates in the wider population. However, if the
   false-positive test probability is non-zero, then values as low as 0.5% - 1% could mean that
   the true prevalence among those tested is lower than suggested by the naive count of
   positive tests.


   Limitations

   First, more data exists than we have been able to analyse. Many of the studies cited here (&
   others - e.g. ​[39]​) have longitudinal data from more patients but which is not currently
   publicly available and we were unable to obtain, or is not disaggregated by swab type.
   Inclusion of this data would provide superior estimates, in particular if it is disaggregated into
   tests done from different samples via different routes in the same patient. Moreover, explicit
   reporting of dates when tests are performed in all patients (and not just those who test
                                                                                                                              10

   positive) would be especially useful to any subsequent similar analyses for SARS-CoV-2 or
   other emerging viruses. We thus advocate for such data to be made available more readily
   in publications and preprints.
   Second, we have attempted to account for possible differences among labs performing
   RT-PCR tests and although we do not find any evidence in favour of this being relevant, nor
   is there enough evidence to rule it out. There may also be variation in terms of the gene that
   is targeted, or method of RT-PCR performed, which we have also not been able to consider
   due to lack of available data (e.g. some target / assay combinations may be more sensitive
   than others ​[40,41]​). We have also assumed that all the patients have been correctly
   identified as infected in each study and that the specificity of the test is perfect; it is likely to
   be extremely high but perhaps not 100% and may similarly vary with assay type ​[42]​.


   Third, we have attempted to account for possible differences among patients in their
   sensitivity to the test. In reality, one might expect this to be related to either the underlying
   severity of the infection (perhaps a higher chance of detection when disease is more severe)
   or, at least, viral load (higher chance of detection with higher viral load); neither of which we
   have been able to assess with currently available data. Furthermore, the data we use is from
   symptomatic patients, most of which were sick enough to require hospital treatment, and it is
   possible that RT-PCR is less sensitive in asymptomatic individuals (not least because there
   is no onset of symptoms and it is therefore unclear from which baseline test sensitivity
   should be measured) or those with more mild disease. A recent Italian study offered
   evidence that, among those testing positive, viral loads were equivalent in symptomatic and
   asymptomatic individuals ​[43]​. This does not show, however, that viral loads are the same in
   both groups, but that they are equivalent conditional on a positive test, which is what we
   might expect if the probability of a positive test is indeed linked to viral load. If this is true,
   then it could be that many asymptomatically infected individuals are asymptomatic because
   their immune responses keep viral replication in check early on and so viral loads sufficient
   to result in a positive test may not be achieved. However, such a scenario might be difficult
   to square with the apparent transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals ​[44]​. Better
   understanding of the sensitivity of the test in asymptomatic individuals is of paramount
   importance but was impossible to assess with currently available data.


   Fourth, and related, we do not have access to testing data from the pre-symptomatic period
   of infection. The high detection probability at symptom onset suggests that viral load could
   be high during the incubation period, particularly just before the onset of symptoms. We
   would also expect that the chances of detecting infection on the day of exposure is next to
   zero, but the detection probability between exposure and prior to symptom onset will likely
   be contingent on a number of factors, including the initial infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2

                                                                                                                              11

   and the length of the incubation period. More data is urgently needed to answer these
   questions, particularly given the estimated transmission potential in this period ​[39,45]


   Finally, when estimating the true number of positives in a cohort of tested individuals we
   have to additionally assume that the distribution of the time to test is the same as we infer
   from our results here and the distribution of time to confirmation in Guangdong ( ​[13]​). Even
   if this distribution is broadly representative from country to country, it may not be consistent
   over time. For example, as testing capacity gets stretched, the time to test may increase and
   so too the probability of a consequent false-negative (or vice versa as testing capacity is
   enhanced). These particular results should therefore be taken as indicative rather than
   authoritative. Furthermore, these results only relate to the cohort of tested individuals rather
   than the population at large: they say nothing about the prevalence of the virus among those
   not tested. That said, individual hospitals, testing centres or studies will know the timings of
   their tests and can use such information in conjunction with the quantitative findings that we
   make available in Supplementary Files to assess how likely any one test is to represent a
   false-negative.


   This work has advanced our understanding of the significant effect that false negative
   RT-PCR tests can have on the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. We have
   demonstrated the sensitivity of population prevalence estimates to erroneous test results,
   and caution that single negative tests should not be overinterpreted. This is particularly
   pertinent when tests are used to determine if healthcare staff and carers are safe to work
   with those most vulnerable to disease, or whether to isolate contacts of suspected infections.
   As nations begin lifting strict social distancing measures and returning to some semblance of
   normality after the first epidemic wave, being able to dependably contact trace and test new
   infections will be critical to prevent resurgence. This work suggests caution should always be
   used when interpreting a single, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result.
