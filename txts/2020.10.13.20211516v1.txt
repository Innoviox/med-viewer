   27       Simple Summary: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treatment response relies
   28       heavily      on   macroscopic       clinical  findings.  Blood    monitoring      of  circulating   markers      such    as
   29       circulating tumour cell (CTC) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) during treatment may improve earlier
   30       detection      of  responders       versus   non-responders     during    definitive   radiotherapy.      Although      the
   31       detection of CTCs and cfDNA in patients with HNSCC has been described, there is minimal data
   32       on the kinetics of CTC counts and cfDNA levels during radiotherapy in patients with HNSCC.
   33       Here, our study prospectively describes the changes in CTC and cfDNA enumeration during
   34       radiotherapy in patients with HNSCC. Our results showed, for the first time to our knowledge, in
   35       HNSCC, that CTCs can be detected during radiotherapy, suggesting mobilization into peripheral
   36       circulation during treatment, with as-yet-unknown viability. cfDNA kinetics during treatment
   37       correlated      with CTC      release, may      indicate  apoptotic     change    during   radiotherapy.      Combined
   38       cfDNA-CTC as an early marker of treatment response should be investigated further.
   39       Abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treatment response relies heavily on
   40       macroscopic clinical findings.            Blood monitoring of circulating markers during treatment may
   41       improve earlier detection of responders versus non-responders during radiotherapy. In this study,
   42       patients with intact tumour of HNSCC were enrolled in the prospective PREDICT-HN study. Pre-,
   43       after    first  treatment,     weekly,     and   post-treatment     blood     samples    were    collected.   CTC      was
   44       enumerated using the CellSearch system. cfDNA was quantified from cfNA isolated at pre-, mid-
   45       and post-treatment timepoints. Blood samples were collected from 45 patients. Of the 339 samples
   46       analysed for CTC, 31% had detectable CTCs. Nine patients had detectable CTCs (1-3/7.5ml blood)
   47       in pre-treatment samples. After 1 fraction, 16 patients had CTCs detected, with 12 who had no
   48       pre-treatment CTC. Sixteen (36%) patients had detectable CTC in final week of treatment. There
   49       was no correlation between cancer stage, nodal status and tumour burden with CTC. cfDNA levels

   57      1. Introduction
   58            The annual incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in the United States
   59      is approximately 50,000 cases, with annual mortality estimated at 11,400 [1]. Radiation therapy is one
   60      of the main curative-intent treatment modalities in patients with HNSCC. The current treatment
   61      pathway       for  those    who     are suitable   for definitive  radiotherapy       treatment   is an  approximate
   62      seven-week course of five daily treatments per week. During radiotherapy, treatment response relies
   63      heavily on macroscopic clinical findings and without any overt symptoms suggestive of progressive
   64      disease, there are currently no imaging or blood tests that are performed during radiotherapy to
   65      stratify   responders       versus    non-responders.     Blood   monitoring     of    circulating  markers  such  as
   66      circulating tumour cell (CTC) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) during treatment may improve earlier
   67      detection of responders versus non-responders during definitive radiotherapy.
   68            CTCs, first described in 1869, are epithelial cells originating from the tumour, that can be
   69      detected within the systemic circulation [2]. These cells are rare and are thought to have evolved
   70      from the original malignant tumour, gaining genetic mutations that allow them to enter the systemic
   71      circulation, evade and survive the host’s immune system, and exit the circulation and establish a
   72      new distant site of disease (seed and soil theory) [3]. Studies have shown the potential use of CTCs as
   73      a prognostic and predictive marker in breast [4, 5], prostate [6], gastric [7], colorectal [8], lung [9, 10]
   74      and head and neck cancers [9]. cfDNA, on the other hand, are genetic materials found within the
   75      systemic circulation that were shed by dying or apoptosed cells [11]. Some of these cfDNA may have
   76      genetic characteristics of the malignancy and therefore are classified as circulating tumour DNA
   77      [12]. There is early evidence that targeted gene panels may be useful in certain group of patients
   78      with HNSCC [13]. As HNSCC is a heterogenous disease, it is a challenge to design a sequence gene
   79      panel as a ‘one size fits all’ for all patients with HNSCC with acceptable sensitivity and specificity for
   80      detection of minimal residual disease. Therefore, combining cfDNA with other blood markers such
   81      as CTC may provide further information and/or improve detection of minimal residual disease in
   82      patients with HNSCC.
   83            Although       the literature has described the         detection of CTCs and cfDNA in patients with
   84      HNSCC, there is minimal data on the kinetics or trajectory of CTC counts and cfDNA levels during
   85      radiotherapy in patients with HNSCC. Here, our study prospectively describes the changes in CTC
   86      and cfDNA enumeration during definitive radiotherapy in patients with HNSCC (PREDICT-HN
   87      study) [14].
   88      2. Results
   89            This    section    may    be    divided   by   subheadings.   It  should   provide      a  concise and  precise
   90      description of the experimental results, their interpretation as well as the experimental conclusions
   91      that can be drawn.
   92      2.1. Patient characteristics
   93            Overall, 45 patients had completed serial blood collection for analysis. Forty (89%) were males,
   94      and the median age of the cohort was 58 years (range: 41 – 81 years). All patients were of good
   95      performance status (ECOG 0 – 1). Thirty (67%) patients received photon therapy delivered using
   96      volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and 15 had intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT).

  100      2.2. Circulating tumour cells (CTC) kinetics
  101            Blood samples were collected at 9 serial timepoints from 45 patients, providing a total of 405
  102      samples.      Of   those,   22   samples      (5.4%)    were not  analyzed   for  CTC      due  to hemolysis and/or
  103      unavailability of consumables.               Therefore, 383 samples were analyzed. Of the 383 samples, 119
  104      (31%) were positive for CTC.
  105            Nine patients had detectable CTCs (1 – 3 CTCs per 7.5ml blood) in pre-treatment samples. After
  106      1 fraction of radiotherapy, 16 patients had CTCs detected (1- 5 CTCs per 7.5ml blood), of which 12
  107      patients had no CTC detected pre-treatment. Figure 1 illustrates the overall kinetics of CTC counts
  108      during radiotherapy for this cohort of patients.                All patients had detectable CTC at some point
  109      during radiotherapy except for 3 patients who had no CTC detected pre, during and post-treatment.
  110      Sixteen (36%) patients had detectable CTC in the final week of treatment. Eleven patients had CTC
  111      detected 2 to 3 months post-treatment. All 11 patients did not have detectable CTC pre-treatment.

  112      Due to the small number of CTCs detected (1 – 5 CTCs), no significant change of quantity of CTCs
  113      between timepoints was detected.

  118            Out of 45 patients, four patients did not complete the MRI component of the study. Therefore,
  119      41 patients had serial weekly MR images – 36 had primary tumour evaluable, and 31 had nodal
  120      tumour evaluated. No significant correlation was detected between primary GTV size and CTC
  121      count for each timepoint (Table 2). CTC count correlated with nodal tumour volume in week 4, but
  122      no significant correlation was observed at other timepoints (Table 2).

  124      2.4. CTC and cfDNA kinetics
  125            Overall the circulating cfDNA levels increased during treatment, with its highest level in the
  126      final week of treatment, and lowest at post-treatment timepoints. As depicted in Figure 2, the levels
  127      of circulating cfDNA remained relatively stable between pre-treatment and mid-treatment (week 4)
  128      timepoints. As the number of CTCs increase in weeks 3 to 6, a rise in cfDNA was detected between
  129      mid-treatment and end-treatment (week 6) timepoints.

  132      2.5. CTC and outcomes
  133            The median follow-up was 12 months (range: 3 – 22 months). The 18-month overall survival
  134      and progression free survival were 94% and 81%, respectively (Figure 3). Eight patients developed
  135      disease recurrences – 2 with local disease, 2 with regional disease, 2 with local and regional disease,
  136      and 2 with distant disease. The CTC kinetics for these patients are depicted in Supplemental Figure
  137      1. Two patients (both with local and regional recurrences) died with disease during this period. With
  138      limited number of events, further correlative statistical analysis was not performed.

  141      3. Discussion
  142            Our     study    showed       that there   was    an   increase in  CTC    numbers      after first fraction  of
  143      radiotherapy, and from mid-treatment (week 3) to end of radiotherapy, in patients undergoing
  144      definitive radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, we observed that
  145      total cell-free DNA also increased from mid-treatment to end of radiotherapy.
  146            Our     study    demonstrated      that   the  trajectory   of CTC   counts     was  not  linear, and  did   not
  147      correspond with tumour shrinkage during radiotherapy in head and neck cancer. This highlights the
  148      importance of an initial systematic assessment of the kinetics of CTC during treatment, rather than
  149      pre-selecting timepoints for convenience assuming a linear response or reduction in number of CTC
  150      to treatment, in future studies for any other tumour sites. In fact, we showed that the number of
  151      CTCs rise after a single fraction of radiotherapy, indicating mobilization of CTC into the systemic
  152      circulation by radiation. Our findings are consistent with a study by Martin et al [17] in patients with
  153      lung cancer, where they detected an increase in the number of CTCs in patients who received

  154      radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer. Their group performed immunostaining of detected
  155      CTCs with      γ-H2AX antibodies and the CTCs demonstrated high γ-H2AX signal indicating that these
  156      cells were from the irradiated tumour site.              The notion that local cancer therapy, such as surgery
  157      and radiotherapy, can potentially mobilize tumour cells into the systemic circulation and potentially
  158      influence the risk of development of distant metastatic disease, is not novel. Several surgical studies
  159      have reported an increase in CTC counts during and/or after oncological surgery in patients [18-23].
  160      With regards to radiotherapy, although not demonstrated in human studies until more recently,
  161      Kaplan      and    Murphy       [24],  in  1949,   showed    that   lung    metastases    were    more  common     in
  162      tumour-bearing mice that received radiotherapy than those were not irradiated. However, the
  163      significance and impact of CTC release into the systemic circulation by oncological treatments on
  164      patients’ outcomes remains unknown.
  165            Although we observed a drop in CTC counts from 1
                                                                                  st
                                                                                     fraction of radiotherapy to week 3, we
  166      noted a rise in the CTC counts in the latter half of the radiotherapy course. The viability and
  167      metastatic potential of these CTCs is unknown. However, Martin et al [17] previously demonstrated
  168      viability of isolated CTCs after radiotherapy from patients with lung cancer, suggesting that CTCs
  169      mobilized by radiotherapy have the capacity to ‘seed and soil’ and establish at a distant site.
  170      Furthermore, we also observed a rise in total cfDNA from mid-treatment to end of treatment.                       As
  171      cfDNA are DNA fragments released into the circulation as a result of cell death or apoptosis, the rise
  172      in cfDNA levels coinciding with the increase in CTC numbers towards the end of treatment may
  173      suggest that the CTC detected were dead or dying cells. Pleasingly, we observed that the levels of
  174      CTCs and cfDNA dropped from final week of treatment to post-treatment timepoint, potentially
  175      indicating successful eradication of disease in some patients, as the detection of either CTC or
  176      cfDNA could potentially indicate residual disease within the patient [25]. Longer follow up is
  177      required in our cohort to determine the predictive value of detected residual CTC and cfDNA at the
  178      post-treatment timepoint. Given the heterogenous group of patients and low level of cfDNA, we did
  179      not proceed to quantify the circulating tumour cfDNA which would confirm if the circulating DNA
  180      originated from the tumour. Previous studies have indicated difficulty in validating results of
  181      tumour      cfDNA in       patients   with   head   and   neck  cancer    due  to  the   small   number of  patients,
  182      heterogeneity of tumour sites and stages, and lack of agreement of molecular targets to quantify [25,
  183      26]. Regardless, this could potentially be investigated in our cohort in the future, once there is
  184      further validation and standardization of molecular targets.
  185            This study comes with its limitations. Firstly, although prospectively evaluated, we had a small
  186      cohort of patients. This study was designed to assess feasibility of collecting serial paired MR
  187      imaging and blood from patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. At the time of
  188      study design, there was limited evidence on the detectability and enumeration of CTC during
  189      radiotherapy in patients with localized head and neck cancer. With a small cohort of patients,
  190      statistical analysis was limited.          Secondly, our study included a heterogeneous group of patients
  191      with HNSCC of different mucosal primaries and of different tumour (T) and nodal (N) stages.
  192      However, we demonstrated that CTC can be detected during radiotherapy regardless of primary
  193      site of disease, and disease stage. The lack of correlation between CTC and GTV may indicate that
  194      these two parameters provide different independent information of the disease biology.                        Longer
  195      follow up is required to demonstrate if either is predictive of subsequent outcomes. Thirdly, we
  196      must acknowledge the limitations of using CellSearch method to enumerate CTCs in our study.
  197      Being an EpCAM-based method of detecting CTC, this method detects malignant cells of epithelial
  198      origin such as squamous cell, but cancer cells that have                   undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  199      transition (EMT) may not be detected. During EMT, to optimize metastatic potential, malignant cells
  200      lose their epithelial markers and gain mesenchymal qualities such as vimentin instead [27, 28].
  201      Furthermore, the viability of the CTC released into the circulation, particularly after first fraction of
  202      radiotherapy, cannot be determined as cells captured by CellSearch are permeabilized and cannot be
  203      isolated and cultured [16]. Another challenge in using CellSearch for CTC quantification is that the
  204      number       of  CTCs      detected    is  reportedly    lower   than   other   methods       of CTC  isolation  and
  205      quantification [17, 29, 30].         Nevertheless, now that we have preliminary data that CTCs are released

  206      into the circulation during radiotherapy, other methods to capture CTCs for culture to determine
  207      viability and metastatic potential can be investigated.
  208      4. Materials and Methods
  209      4.1. Patient selection
  210            All eligible patients seen at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center from May
  211      2017    through       August       2018    were   offered    participation   in  this     prospective    observational
  212      PREDICT-HN           study   approved       by  the  institutional  review   board     (ClinicalTrials.gov    Identifier:
  213      NCT03491176).         The   full   study   protocol   has   been  previously   published      [14]. Eligibility  criteria
  214      include pathologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, intact primary and/or nodal tumour
  215      visible on imaging, and good performance status (ECOG 0 – 1). Patients with evidence of distant
  216      metastatic disease, had contraindications to MR imaging, or had previous head and neck irradiation
  217      less than 5 years ago were excluded. Informed consent was obtained from the participant prior to
  218      any study-related imaging or blood collection.
  219      4.2. Radiotherapy treatment
  220            Patients     had    definitive    radiotherapy    as   per institutional  standard      of  care protocol,    after
  221      pathological diagnosis and complete staging work up. All cases were discussed at the institutional
  222      head    and     neck    tumour      board   prior  to  treatment.   Patients   were     treated   with  curative-intent
  223      radiotherapy with/ without concurrent chemotherapy. All patients were reviewed, discussed and
  224      their radiation therapy contours reviewed at the departmental head and neck quality assurance
  225      clinic by head and neck radiation oncologists.
  226      4.3. Blood collection and circulating tumour cell (CTC) enumeration
  227            Whole blood was collected aseptically by venipuncture or from a venous port into a 10ml
  228      CellSave preservation tube and two 10ml EDTA tubes at the specified serial timepoints (Figure 1).
  229      The presence and quantification of CTCs were performed using blood collected in the CellSave tube
  230      using the standardized, semiautomatic FDA-approved Cellsearch system. The CellSearch method of
  231      CTC enumeration was previously described in detail [4, 15, 16]. In brief, the blood-filled CellSave
  232      tube    was      centrifuged        to  separate    plasma     from    solid   blood      components.         Following
  233      immunomagnetic capture and enrichment of cells expressing                       epithelial cell adhesion molecule
  234      (EpCAM)-with antibody-coated nanoparticles from 7.5ml of blood, these cells were stained with
  235      fluorescent nucleic acid dye 4,2-diaminodino-2-phenylindole hydrochlroride (DAPI), and antibodies
  236      specific      for    epithelial      cells   (cytokeratin     8,18,  19    –   phycoerythrin)        and     leukocytes
  237      (CD45-allophycocyanin).            A   semiautomated      fluorescence-based microscope          system was     used   to
  238      identify CTCs. CTCs were defined as cytokeratin positive and CD-45 negative nucleated cells [4]. A
  239      qualified laboratory technician reviewed and confirmed all results.
  240            All blood collected in CellSave tubes were analysed for CTCs within 72 hours of collection.                     To
  241      avoid intervention-related CTC release into circulation, the pre-radiotherapy blood was collected at
  242      least a week after any invasive procedure, such as a biopsy.
  243      4.4. cfDNA enumeration
  244            Blood collected in the EDTA tubes were centrifuged and the plasma was filtered and collected
  245      prior to storage at -80C. For cfDNA enumeration, 4ml of frozen plasma from pre-, mid (week 4), end
  246      (week 6) and post-radiotherapy were used. cfNA was isolated using the commercially available
  247      MagMAX Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cfDNA was quantified using Qubit
  248      high sensitivity dsDNA assay (Invitrogen).

  250            Patients      had    pre-treatment,     weekly    during     treatment,   and     post-treatment   MRI  scans.
  251      Pre-treatment MRI was obtained within 2 weeks before commencement of radiotherapy. Patients
  252      were imaged in radiotherapy treatment position, and immobilized with a thermoplastic mask using
  253      the MAGNETOM Aera 1.5T MR scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Germany) with two 4-channel large
  254      flex   phased-array       coils,   and  32-channel     phased-array     spine  coil.   Specific  MR  sequences  and
  255      parameters were detailed in the published protocol [14].
  256      4.6. Statistical analysis
  257            Missing values were not imputed: where there were missing data for an outcome variable,
  258      those records were removed from any formal statistical analysis of that outcome variable (complete
  259      case analysis), unless otherwise specified. Graphs and descriptive statistics were used to understand
  260      characteristics of GTV and CTC, and relationship between GTV and CTC. The correlation between
  261      CTC count and the gross tumour volume (GTV) was calculated using Spearman’s rank correlation
  262      coefficient. The linear mixed model (LMM) was used to evaluate change in GTV, CTCs and cfDNA
  263      over    time.      Factors   associated     with   post-treatment     outcomes    (GTV     and   CTC)  change  from
  264      pre-treatment       were    examined     using   linear  regression    adjusted  for    pre-treatment  value, unless
  265      otherwise specified.
  266            The    time    to  events    (overall survival and      progression   free  survival) were described using
  267      Kaplan-Meier methods. The time to events were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and time to
  268      events outcome estimate at months 6, 12, and 18 were provided with 95% confidence intervals. All
  269      analyses and data manipulations were carried out using SAS 9.4 and JMP 14.0 (SAS Institute Inc.).
  270      5. Conclusions
  271            In conclusion, our results showed, for the first time to our knowledge, in head and neck
  272      squamous cell carcinoma, that CTCs can be detected during radiotherapy, suggesting mobilization
  273      into peripheral circulation during treatment, with as-yet-unknown viability. cfDNA kinetics during
  274      treatment correlated with CTC release, may (and                   hopefully)   indicate    apoptotic change during
  275      radiotherapy.        Combined       cfDNA-CTC       as  an   early   marker   of  treatment     response  should  be
  276      prospectively and systematically investigated.
