    Introduction
    At the beginning of the epidemic, and also during the first months, we have two sets of covid-19
    data: Severe covid-19 cases (those in hospitals, where they were tested and confirmed), and
    deaths due to covid-19. Mathematical models were formulated and used to fit the epidemic
    curve to estimate the basic reproduction number R0 .
        In the literature, the usually assumed basic reproduction number R0 is around 2.5, see for
    instance [1] and [2]. The reliable estimation of R0 is important because this number determines
    the magnitude of effort to eradicate infection. For instance, the efforts of vaccination to eradi-
    cate an infection must be vaccinating a fraction equal or greater than 1 − 1/R0 of susceptibles
    [3]. In [4], analyzing vaccination as a control mechanism, if R0 is reduced by the vaccine to
    value lower than one, the number of cases decreased following exponential-type decay.
        The estimation of the basic reproduction number R0 , however, depends on the mathematical
    model. We consider two examples. The first model is the simplest susceptible - infectious -
    recovered (SIR) model, and the second is a model taking into account more aspects of the
    natural history of covid-19 infection encompassing the lethality rate depending on the age,
    called the elaborated model. These models are fitted taking into account the severe covid-19
    data collections from São Paulo State (Brazil) [5] and Spain [6].
        São Paulo State, Brazil, has 44.6 million inhabitants (demographic density, 177/km2 ) with
    15.3% of the population comprised of elder individuals. The first case was registered on Febru-
    ary 26, and partial quarantine was implemented on March 24. Considering that there is a delay
    around 9 days since the infection and the onset of covid-19, we estimate the basic reproduction
    number considering collected data from February 26 to April 2.
        Spain has 47.4 million inhabitants (demographic density, 92.3/km2 ) with 25.8% of the popu-
    lation comprised of elder individuals. The first case was registered on January 31, and lockdown
    was implemented on March 16. Considering a delay of around 9 days, we estimate the basic
                                                                         2

    reproduction number considering collected data from January 31 to March 25.
        Yang et al. [7], using the elaborated model, estimated R0 using the first period of covid-19
    data representing the natural (without any interventions) epidemic, obtaining 9.24 (São Paulo
    State) and 8.0 (Spain). The estimation of R0 based on the first period is in concordance with
    the definition of the basic reproduction number: Completely susceptible population without
    constraints (interventions) [3].

        In Appendix A, the steady-state corresponding to the system of equations (1) was analyzed
    to obtain the basic reproduction number R0 . For simplicity, let us consider φ = µ. The system

    case of covid-19 is introduced at t = 0, that is, the initial conditions supplied to equation (3)
    are S(0) = N − 1 and I(0) = 1. For a large population, we can approximate S ∼ N and the
    system of equations can be approximated by
                                                 (
                                                      d
                                                      dt
                                                         S   ∼ −βI
                                                      d
                                                      dt
                                                         I   ∼ (γ + µ + α) (R0 − 1) I,
    with R = N − S − I. Hence, at the beginning of the epidemic, if we estimate the transmission
    rate β, we can calculate R0 using the expression obtained from the steady-state analysis. The
    system of equations (3) does not approach to a steady-state, but attains it when α = 0. In this
    case, asymptotically (t → ∞), we have dI/dt = 0 if Ref = R0 S/N = 1, that is, S → S ∗ = s∗ N
    and I → I ∗ = i∗ N , where i∗ and s∗ are given by equations (A.6) and (A.7), respectively.
    Therefore, when α = 0, at t = 0, Ref = R0 , and when t → ∞ (steady-state), Ref = 1 (see
    equation (A.7)), from which we retrieve the well known relationship s∗ = 1/R0 [3].
        Therefore, based on Ref given by equation (4) when φ = µ and α = 0, the basic reproduction
    number R0 obtained from mathematical modelings provides two useful information: At the
    beginning of the epidemic (t = 0), R0 gives the magnitude of the initial takeoff of the epidemic,
    and when epidemic reaches the steady-state (after many waves of the epidemic, that is, t → ∞),
    R0 measures its severity providing the fraction of susceptible individuals, that is, s∗ = 1/R0 .
    Between these two extremes, the effective reproduction number Ref dictates the course of an
    epidemic, which follows decaying oscillations around Ref = 1 [4]. It is worth stressing the fact
    that Ref given by equation (4) is valid only when φ = µ and α = 0, and when one of these
    conditions is not valid, Ref given by equation (4) can be used as an approximated value.
        The number of accumulated severe covid-19 cases Ω is given by the exits from S, and
    entering into classes I, that is,
                                                      d           I

         We estimate the basic reproduction number using equation (1) with different infective per-
    sons at t = 0. The model parameters are γ = 1/10, and, for São Paulo State, φ = µ =
    1/(78.4 × 365) and α = 0.002, and for Spain, φ = µ = 1/(83.4 × 365) and α = 0.002 (all
    in days−1 ). The transmission rate β is estimated and the basic reproduction number R0 is
    calculated using equation (A.2).
         For the data collected from São Paulo State, we obtained for I(0) = 1, R0 = 3.14 with
    Sum = 8.02 × 105 , for I(0) = 10, R0 = 2.4 with Sum = 8.49 × 105 , for I(0) = 25, R0 = 2.11
    with Sum = 1.86 × 106 , and for I(0) = 100, R0 = 1.62 with Sum = 5.87 × 106 . Other initial
    conditions are S(0) = 44.6 million and R(0) = 0. The lowest Sum occurs when R0 = 3.14.
         For the data collected from Spain, we obtained for I(0) = 1, R0 = 2.97 with Sum =
    4.16 × 108 , for I(0) = 10, R0 = 2.5 with Sum = 6.32 × 108 , for I(0) = 25, R0 = 2.3 with
    Sum = 1.13 × 109 , and for I(0) = 100, R0 = 2.06 with Sum = 1.19 × 109 . Other initial
    conditions are S(0) = 47.4 million and R(0) = 0. The lowest Sum occurs when R0 = 2.97.
         We observed that the larger the value of I(0), the small is the estimated R0 . By the stringent
    definition of R0 , we must consider I(0) = 1. However, the initial condition I(0) > 1 mimics
    the first case of covid-19 occurring earlier than the time t = 0. The Singapore University of
    Technology and Design [8] estimated R0 using I(0) = 100 for different countries.
    2      The elaborated model
    One of the main aspects of covid-19 is increased lethality in elder individuals. For this reason,
    a population is divided into two groups, composed of young (60 years old or less, denoted by
    subscript y), and elder (60 years old or more, denoted by subscript o) individuals. The vital
    dynamic of this community is described by the per-capita rates of birth (φ) and mortality (µ),
    and ϕ is the aging rate, that is, the flow from young subpopulation y to elder subpopulation o.
         Since we are dealing with the initial phase of the epidemic, the model is that presented in
    [7], but the compartments related to quarantine and mass testing are removed. Hence, for each
    subpopulation j (j = y, o), individuals are divided into six classes: susceptible Sj , exposed and

    and a fraction zj of mild covid-19 (Q2j ) classes are transmitting the virus, and other infected
    classes ((1 − zj ) Q2j and D2j ) are under voluntary or forced isolation. Susceptible persons are
    infected according to λj Sj (known as the mass action law [3]) and enter into class Ej , where
    λj is the per-capita incidence rate (or force of infection) defined by λj = λ (δjy + ψδjo ), with λ

    where δij is Kronecker delta, with δij = 1 if i = j, and 0, if i 6= j; and β1j , β2j and β3j are
    the transmission rates, that is, the rates at which a virus encounters a susceptible people and
    infects him/her. After an average period 1/σj in class Ej , where σj is the incubation rate,
    exposed individuals enter into the asymptomatic class Aj (with probability pj ) or pre-diseased
    class D1j (with probability 1 − pj ). After an average period 1/γj in class Aj , where γj is
    the recovery rate of asymptomatic individuals, asymptomatic individuals acquire immunity
    (recovered) and enter into immune class I. Possibly asymptomatic individuals can manifest
    symptoms at the end of this period, and a fraction 1 − χj enters into mild covid-19 class Q2j .
    For symptomatic persons, after an average period 1/γ1j in class D1j , where γ1j is the infection
    rate of pre-diseased individuals, pre-diseased individuals enter into severe covid-19 class D2j
    (with probability 1 − mj ) or class Q2j (with probability mj ). Individuals in class D2 acquire
    immunity after period 1/γ2j , where γ2j is the recovery rate of severe covid-19, and enter into
    class I or die under the disease-induced (additional) mortality rate αj . Individuals in class Q2j
    acquire immunity after period 1/γ3j , where γ3j is the recovery rate of mild covid-19, and enter
    into immune class I.

    plus I(0) = 0, where the initial simulation time t = 0 corresponds to the calendar time when
    the first case was confirmed (February 26 for São Paulo State, and January 31 for Spain). For
    São Paulo State, N0y = 37.8 million and N0o = 6.8 million, and for Spain, N0y = 35.17 million
    and N0o = 12.23 million.
        For the data collected from São Paulo State, we obtained R0 = 9.24, with Sum = 1.22×106 ,
    while for the data collected from Spain, we obtained R0 = 8.0, with Sum = 5.8 × 108 . If we let
    zy = zo = 0 (mild covid-19 cases do not transmit) and χy = χo = 1 (asymptomatic individuals
    do not relapse to mild covid-19), the estimated basic reproduction number is R0 = 8.72 for São
    Paulo State, with Sum = 1.23 × 106 , and R0 = 7.35 for Spain, with Sum = 1.59 × 108 .
    3      Discussion and conclusion
    Firstly, in the elaborated model, there are several infectious classes but the severe covid-19
    cases do not transmit the SARS-CoV-2, for this reason, R0 does not depend on the additional
    mortality rates αy and αo (see equations (13) and (14)). On the other hand, in the SIR model,
    there is only one infectious class, and R0 depends on the additional mortality rate α (see
    equation (A.2)).
        As we have pointed out, at the beginning and also in the early phase of the covid-19 epidemic,
    only hospitalized severe covid-19 cases were registered after confirmed by serological or PCR
    test. These individuals are either isolated in hospitals (receiving treatment) or discharged from
    hospitals but recommend to be isolated in their home. Then, somehow, the majority of these
    individuals are not participating in the populational SARS-CoV-2 chain transmission. In the
    SIR model, the unique way to estimate the transmission rate is considering that severe covid-9
    cases are forming the infective class I. Hence, the estimation of R0 provided by the SIR model
    using severe covid-19 cases is unrealistic.
        There are different manners to define an epidemic curve. For instance, one possible definition
    is the curve formed by those positive for serological and PCR tests. However, in the early phase
    of (natural) epidemic, the covid-19 epidemic curve must be defined by severe cases, which are
    the only available data. In the elaborated model, the covid-19 epidemic curve was retrieved by
                                                                         9

    estimating the transmission rates of asymptomatic, pre-diseased, and a fraction of mild classes.
    The estimated basic reproduction number was higher than that usually accepted: R0 = 9.24
    for São Paulo State, and R0 = 8.0 for Spain. The usually accepted estimation of R0 is around 3
    obtained from the SIR model, which results from the estimated transmission rate of the severe
    covid-19 class. In [9], it was shown that the ratio between non-apparent and apparent covid-19
    is around 24, showing that SARS-CoV-2 is being transmitted by a huge number of hidden cases.
        In the elaborated model, the initial conditions E(0) = 50 and I(0) = 1 were supplied to
    the dynamical system, resulting in R0 = 9.24 (São Paulo State) and R0 = 8.0 (Spain). Instead
    of comparing with the SIR model, let us compare with the SEIR model considering the same
    initial conditions E(0) = 50 and I(0) = 1 supplied to the elaborated model (see Appendix B).
    The estimated basic reproduction number for São Paulo State was R0 = 3.92, and for Spain,
    R0 = 4.41.
        Comparing SIR, SEIR, and elaborated model, as the model incorporates more aspects of the
    natural history of the infection, higher becomes the estimation of R0 . For SIR and SEIR models,
    there is not any alternative except considering severe covid-19 cases as infective. However, in
    the elaborated model, the asymptomatic (A), pre-diseased (D1 ) and a fraction of mild covid-19
    (Q2 ) individuals are transmitting SARS-CoV-2, but the severe covid-19 (D2 ) individuals are
    isolated and do not contribute, except to the hospital staff [9].
        As we have pointed out, the estimation of R0 is important because this number determines
    the magnitude of effort to eradicate infection. In [7], describing the lockdown in Spain, they
    argued that if R0 = 3, at least 67% of the population must be isolated to control the epidemic,
    while for R0 = 8, at least 87% of the population must be isolated. They showed that 70% of the
    population in lockdown did not explain the covid-19 data in Spain, but 90% of the population
    in lockdown explained better the observed data.
        With respect to the SIR model, Li et al. [10] explicitly cited that, by using data from
    January 10 to February 8, 2020, they estimated the effective reproduction number Ref instead
    of R0 , arguing that the most recent common ancestor could have occurred on November 17,
    2019. The time elapsed from November 17, 2019 (the first case) to January 10, 2020 (the first
    day in the estimation) is 54 days. However, on January 23, 2020, Wuhan and other cities
    of Hubei province imposed a rigid lockdown, sowing that they estimated R0 taking also into
    account data recorded 16 days after the lockdown. In other words, they used the severe covid-
    19 data from 54 after the possible first case to 16 days after the implementation of a rigid
    lockdown (January 10 to February 8).
        We conclude that the SIR model is not appropriate to estimate the basic reproduction
    number R0 , specifically in the case of the covid-19 epidemic when the severe covid-19 cases
                                                                        10

    portant aspects related to the natural history of the infection estimate more accurately R0 .
    For instance, the incorporation of the asymptomatic individuals, the pre-diseased individuals,

    When R0 > 1, we have P2 (1) < 0 (the condition γ + φ > α is satisfied once γ > α), and the
    two positive roots of P2 (i) are such that 0 < i∗1 < 1 < i∗2 . Hence the small root i∗1 is biologically
    feasible. When R0 = 1, we have i∗1 = 0 and i∗2 > 1, hence i∗1 = 0 is biologically feasible. When
    R0 < 1, we have i∗1 < 0 and i∗2 > 1, hence i∗1 = 0 is biologically feasible. Therefore, the small
    root i∗1 , which is biologically feasible, assumes a negative value for R0 < 1, zero at R0 = 1, and
    positive value but lower than 1 for R0 > 1. The small root of P2 (i) is given by

    σ = 1/5.8 days−1 (elaborated model), and the values for other parameters are those provided in
    the SIR model. The value γ = 1/10 days−1 in somehow considered an average value among γ,
    γ1 , γ2 and γ3 in the elaborated model. The estimated basic reproduction number for São Paulo

        Notice that σ/ (σ + µ) = 0.99999, hence, R0 given by equations (A.2) and (B.2) must be
    equal if β is the same. However, β is estimated by the dynamical systems (1) or (B.1) against
    the accumulated severe covid-19 cases. For this reason, the estimated β must be different
    between SIR and SEIR models. Let us consider SEIR model considering the initial conditions
    S(0) = N0 , E(0) = 0, R(0) = 0, and varying I(0).
        For the data collected from São Paulo State, with S(0) = 44.6 million, we obtained for
    I(0) = 1, R0 = 7.84 with Sum = 1.11 × 106 , for I(0) = 10, R0 = 5.1 with Sum = 4.52 × 105 ,
    for I(0) = 25, R0 = 4.02 with Sum = 1.21 × 106 , and for I(0) = 100, R0 = 2.74 with
    Sum = 3.51 × 106 . The lowest Sum occurs when R0 = 5.1.
        For the data collected from Spain, with S(0) = 47.4 million, we obtained for I(0) = 1,
    R0 = 6.86 with Sum = 7.01×108 , for I(0) = 10, R0 = 5.1 with Sum = 7.79×108 , for I(0) = 25,
    R0 = 4.46 with Sum = 9.54 × 108 , and for I(0) = 100, R0 = 3.58 with Sum = 1.33 × 109 . The
    lowest Sum occurs when R0 = 6.86.
        Comparing with the estimated R0 provided by the SIR model (see the main text), we observe
    that SEIR model estimated with higher value. Let us assess the role played by E(0). We choose
    data from São Paulo State, letting I(0) = 10, S(0) = 44.6 million, R(0) = 0, and varying E(0)
    (for the SIR model, R0 = 2.4). for E(0) = 1, R0 = 5.03 with Sum = 4.57 × 105 , for E(0) = 10,
    R0 = 4.61 with Sum = 6.19 × 105 , for E(0) = 25, R0 = 4.13 with Sum = 9.86 × 105 , and
    for E(0) = 100, R0 = 3.04 with Sum = 3.31 × 106 . The lowest Sum occurs when R0 = 5.03,
    however, as E(0) increases, the estimated R0 approaches to that provided by the SIR model.
