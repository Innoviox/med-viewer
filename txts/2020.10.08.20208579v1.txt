    ABSTRACT
    Background: Yearly influenza immunization is recommended for immunocompromised (IC)
    individuals, although immune responses are lower than that for the non-immunocompromised
    and the data on vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the IC is scarce. We evaluated VE against
    influenza-associated hospitalization among IC adults.
    Methods: We analyzed data from adults ≥ 18 years hospitalized with acute respiratory illness
    (ARI) during the 2017-2018 influenza season at 10 hospitals in the United States. IC adults
    were identified using pre-specified case-definitions, utilizing electronic medical record data. VE
    was evaluated with a test-negative case-control design using multivariate logistic regression
    with PCR-confirmed influenza as the outcome and vaccination status as the exposure, adjusting
    for age, enrolling site, illness onset date, race, days from onset to specimen collection, self-
    reported health, and self-reported hospitalizations.
    Results: Of 3,524 adults hospitalized with ARI, 1,210 (34.3%) had an immunocompromising
    condition. IC adults were more likely to be vaccinated than non-IC (69.5% vs 65.2%), and less
    likely to have influenza (22% vs 27.8%). The mean age did not differ among IC and non-IC
    (61.4 vs 60.8 years old). The overall VE against influenza hospitalization, including
    immunocompetent adults, was 33% (95% CI, 21% to 44%). VE among IC vs non-IC adults was
    lower at 5% (-29% to 31%) vs. 41% (27% to 52%) (p<0.05 for interaction term).
    Conclusions: VE in one influenza season was very low among IC individuals. Future efforts
    should include evaluation of VE among the different immunocompromising conditions and
    whether enhanced vaccines improve the suboptimal effectiveness among the
    immunocompromised.

    Introduction
    The number of immunocompromised (IC) individuals has increased due to greater longevity of
    the population, increasing numbers of solid organ and stem cell transplants, advances in the
    treatment of hematologic and solid malignancies, increase in the number of individuals living
    with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the use of steroids, immune-modulating agents,
    and other immunosuppressive drugs to treat autoimmune and inflammatory conditions [1, 2].
    Immunosuppressive conditions are heterogeneous and the degree and type of immune
    deficiency caused by each one of these conditions vary, but a unifying consequence is an
    increased risk of many infectious diseases including influenza [3]. Influenza is a common cause
    of illness and death, with an estimated 140,000-810,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations
    and 12,000-61,000 influenza-associated deaths annually in the United States [4].
    IC individuals are at higher risk for influenza-related complications, including increased
    frequency of hospitalization, ICU admission, longer duration of hospitalization, and death [5-10].
    Influenza vaccination is the best available intervention for preventing these complications and
    annual influenza vaccination is recommended for IC individuals [11]. However, the data on
    protection afforded by influenza vaccines in IC adults are scarce. A recent study on cancer
    patients demonstrated a vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 20% against influenza hospitalization, as
    compared to 42% in the general population [12, 13]. Most studies of IC adults are small and
    evaluate immunogenicity as a surrogate of effectiveness [14]. These immunogenicity studies
    among various IC groups have demonstrated that antibody responses to inactivated influenza
    vaccines are suboptimal compared to those without immunosuppression [14, 15]. However,
    immune response to vaccine does not necessarily directly relate to vaccine effectiveness [16,
    17]. Since the 2015-2016 influenza season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
    (CDC)-funded U.S. Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) has
    estimated influenza VE among adults hospitalized for acute respiratory infections.
                                                                                                                                       3

    Understanding influenza VE in IC individuals is crucial to the development of appropriate
    vaccination and public health policies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate influenza VE
    among hospitalized immunocompromised adults enrolled in the HAIVEN study during the 2017-
    2018 influenza season, when specific efforts were made to identify immunocompromised
    patients using case-definitions for immunocompromising conditions.
    Methods
    Study design and enrollment
    The HAIVEN study is a multi-center, prospective, test-negative case-control study to determine
    an annual estimate of VE against influenza-associated hospitalizations among adults in the
    United States. Methods for the HAIVEN study have been described previously[18]. Briefly,
    adults ≥ 18 years of age with new or worsening cough or sputum production of ≤10 days’
    duration and a respiratory specimen collected ≤ 10 days from illness onset and ≤ 72 hours after
    hospital admission at one of ten hospitals in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Tennessee, and Texas
    were eligible. Inclusion criteria included age ≥18 years, admission for an acute respiratory
    illness, or worsening of a chronic respiratory illness with a new or worsening cough. During the
    2017-2018 influenza season, details on demographics, symptoms, influenza vaccination status,
    number of recent hospitalizations, and history of organ or stem cell transplant and,
    chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the preceding year were collected through the enrollment
    interview. Information about the clinical course and disease severity was obtained from
    electronic medical records (EMR). All international classification of diseases-10 diagnosis
    clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) codes and current procedural terminology (CPT) codes from
    all encounters in the 12 months before enrollment were obtained from the EMR and utilized to
    identify the high-risk conditions associated with an increased risk of serious influenza
    complications [11].
                                                                                                                                       4

    Influenza case classification
    Enrolled patients provided respiratory specimens for influenza testing by polymerase chain
    reaction (PCR). Specimens were either nasal and oropharyngeal swabs that were tested in
    research laboratories with CDC PCR protocols or clinical nasopharyngeal specimens tested by
    PCR in hospital laboratories provided they were collected within 10 days of illness onset and 72
    hours of admission. Enrolled patients who tested positive for influenza were classified as cases
    and those who tested negative for all influenza types were controls.
    Influenza vaccination status
    Self-reported current season influenza vaccination status was confirmed by medical record
    review, state immunization registry records, occupational health records, health insurance billing
    claims, and records from patients’ primary care providers. Information collected included date
    and route of administration and product name, manufacturer, and lot number. Self-reported
    vaccination was accepted if the patient provided a date and location for the vaccination. A
    participant was considered vaccinated if s/he received the 2017-18 influenza vaccine ≥ 14 days
    before illness onset. Because up to 14 days is required to mount an immune response to
    vaccination, those vaccinated 0 to 13 days before illness onset were excluded due to
    indeterminate vaccination status.
    Identification of immunocompromising conditions
    All ICD-10-CM codes for all encounters and receipt of the biologic chemotherapeutic agents
    bortezomib, carfilzomib, daratumumab, dasatinib, gemtuzumab, and imatinib in the year before
    study enrollment were collected from EMR data. In the 2017-2018 influenza season the
    enrollment questionnaire asked if the participant received chemotherapy or radiation therapy for
    cancer in the 12 months before enrollment. Eight groups of immunocompromising conditions
    were defined: organ transplantation, stem cell transplantation, underlying immunodeficiency,
                                                                                                                                       5

    connective tissue disorder, receipt of chemotherapy or radiation therapy, hematologic
    conditions, chronic steroid use, and HIV. The basis for the groups was a previously described
    algorithm for identifying patients with active immunosuppression utilizing ICD and CPT codes in
    a large database of patients with severe sepsis[19]. We slightly modified this algorithm in two
    aspects. For solid malignancies, we only included patients actively treated with chemotherapy
    or radiation to improve specificity of immunosuppression. We also included patients with chronic
    use of steroids. We considered the enrollment question on receipt of chemotherapy or radiation
    therapy as the gold standard and our data found that ICD-10-CM and CPT codes have low
    sensitivity to identify patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy (Supplementary
    Table S1). Therefore, we identified patients with immunocompromising conditions based on
    ICD-10-CM codes listed (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2), except for the receipt of
    chemotherapy or radiation therapy, which were determined from ICD-10-CM codes, or receipt of
    one of the biologic chemotherapeutic agents listed, or a positive answer to the enrollment
    question about the receipt of chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
    The IC groups were mutually exclusive; therefore, if a participant had more than one IC
    condition, they were grouped hierarchically following the group order listed above. The
    hierarchical order of groups is shown in supplementary Figure S1 and was based on the
    authors’ expert opinion, to better identify active immunosuppressive conditions because we did
    not have data on the use of immunosuppressants other than steroids and biologicals in the
    dataset. For example, to identify patients with malignancies on active therapy, chemotherapy or
    radiation therapy preceded hematologic condition.
    Statistical analysis
    Demographic and other characteristics of the IC and non-IC groups were compared using
    Pearson  test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables and two-sample t-test for
    continuous variables.

    VE was calculated by estimating the odds of influenza positivity among vaccinated patients
    compared to unvaccinated patients for the IC and non-IC groups using multivariate logistic
    regression using influenza positivity as the outcome and vaccination status as the exposure
    variable, with VE = (1 – adjusted odds ratio) × 100% [20].
    In the primary analysis, we stratified the sample by immunocompromised status and estimated
    VE in each stratum:

    where
    flu       =           1 if PCR-confirmed flu case (of specific type/subtype); 0 otherwise
    vacc      =           1 if received vaccine ≥14 d prior to symptom onset; 0 otherwise
    Z          =          vector of adjustment variables including age (continuous), enrollment site, race,
                          days from illness onset to specimen collection, date of illness onset (categorized
                          as pre-peak, peak, or post-peak influenza periods [18]), self-reported health
                          status (poor/fair and good/very good/excellent) and self-reported number of
                          hospitalizations
    and with VE defined as
                                                    𝑉𝐸      = [1 − exp(𝛽 )] ∗ 100% .
    To test if VE differed by immunocompromised status, we regressed flu status on vaccination
    status, immunocompromised status, and the pairwise multiplicative interaction between
    vaccination status and immunocompromised status:
                           𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡 (𝑓𝑙𝑢 = 1) = 𝛽 + 𝛽 (𝑣𝑎𝑐𝑐) + 𝛽 (𝐼𝐶) + 𝛽 (𝑣𝑎𝑐𝑐 ∗ 𝐼𝐶) … + 𝛽 𝑍

    Effect modification of VE by immunocompromised status was assumed to be statistically
    significant if the test statistic for assessing if the coefficient for the interaction term, β 3, differed
    from zero had a p value <0.05.
    In secondary analyses, we stratified subjects by type-specific immunocompromised status and
    estimated VE within each stratum using a main effects model:

    where variables are defined as above except for models for immunodeficiency and HIV
    subgroups in which
    Z          =          vector of adjustment variables including age (continuous), enrollment site, race,
                          days from illness onset to specimen collection, date of illness onset (categorized
                          as pre-peak, peak, or post-peak influenza periods [18]), self-reported health
                          status (poor/fair and good/very good/excellent) and self-reported number of
                          hospitalizations
    Because we did not specifically calculate sample sizes for this study, we did a post hoc power
    analysis based on the observed number of cases (n=900) and controls (2600), vaccination rate
    among controls (67%), power of 80%, and a significance level of 0.05. We determined a
    minimum detectable vaccine effectiveness of 20% in our overall study population during the
    2017-2018 influenza season based on these assumptions.
    Analyses were conducted with SAS version 9.4 software. Statistical significance was defined as
    a p-value < 0.05 or a 95% confidence interval (CI) excluding the null value. We interpreted
    differences in VE estimates by IC vs non-IC subgroups, considering p-value <0.15 as
                                                                                                                                       8

    statistically significant which is in line with guidance for interpreting interaction between two
    dichotomous variables when effect size is expected to be moderate to high[21, 22]. The study
    protocol was approved by the research ethics boards at the participating institutions.
    Results
    A total of 4,108 hospitalized adults were enrolled in HAIVEN in the 2017-2018 influenza season.
    Of these, 584 were excluded because of enrollment earlier or later than the period of influenza
    circulation in the community (n=259), missing vaccination status (n=201), missing number of
    self-reported past year hospitalizations (n=59), and other reasons (n=65) (Figure 1). In the
    resulting dataset (n=3,524), 1,210 (34.3%) adults were identified as having an
    immunocompromising condition: organ transplant (n=144, 11.9%); stem cell transplant (n=28,
    2.3%); underlying immunodeficiency (n=49, 4.0%); connective tissue and rheumatologic
    disease (n=130, 10.7%); chemotherapy and radiation therapy (n=242, 20%); hematologic
    condition (n=175, 14.5%); chronic steroid use (n=397, 32.8%) and HIV (n=45, 3.7%).
    Overall, participants were more likely to be female (56.9%) and white (62.2%). Mean age was
    61 (SD 17.1) years, 66.7% were vaccinated, 25.8% had influenza, and 84.2% had ≥ 3 high-risk
    conditions (Table 2). The IC and non-IC groups differed for several characteristics. IC
    participants were significantly more likely than non-IC to be of white race (67.9% vs 59.3%,
    p<0.001), have a lower BMI (30.1 vs 31.2, p=0.003), be vaccinated (60.2% vs 54.6%, p=0.002),
    have a longer length of stay (4 vs 3 days, p<0.001), have ≥ 3 high-risk conditions (94.2% vs
    79%, p<0.001), have had ≥ 4 hospitalizations in the previous year (25.5% vs 19.1%, p<0.001),
    and present earlier in the pre-peak period (42.1% vs 37.4%, p=0.02). IC participants were
    significantly less likely than non-IC participants to test positive for influenza (22% vs 27.8%,
    p<0.001) and to self-report their health as fair or poor (45% vs 53.6%, p<0.001) (Table 2).

    There were 266 influenza cases in the IC adults and 644 influenza cases in non-IC adults. Most
    influenza infections were caused by influenza A, and 530 (78.8%) were A(H3N2) viruses. Of
    238 influenza B infections, 200 (84%) were due to B Yamagata lineage viruses (Figure 2).
    The patients in the 8 immunocompromised groups differed in sex, enrollment site, age/age
    group, race, BMI, influenza status, documented influenza vaccination, number of high-risk
    conditions, and self-reported health status, but not in the number of hospitalizations in the
    previous year, interval from illness onset to specimen collection, and date of illness onset
    (Supplementary Table S3).
    Overall, vaccination was 33% (95% CI, 21% to 44%) effective in preventing hospitalization.
    Among IC adults, VE was 5% and not significant (95% CI, -29% to 31%). VE in non-IC adults
    was 41% (95% CI, 27% to 52%) (p<0.05 for interaction term) (Table 3). VE for the different
    immunocompromised conditions varied widely, from -73% for individuals with underlying
    immunodeficiency to 84% for stem cell transplant; however, this study was not powered to look
    at these subgroups and the confidence intervals varied widely (Supplementary figure S2).
    Discussion
    During the high-severity 2017-2018 US influenza season, we found that influenza vaccination
    reduced the risk of influenza-associated hospitalization among adults by 33%. Overall, VE
    during the 2017-2018 season was lower than that estimated in previous seasons in this network
    (42-54%) [18, 23]. The fact that influenza A(H3N2) viruses circulating in 2017-2018 were
    antigenically different from the vaccine H3N2 strain because of suspected egg-adapted
    glycosylation in the antigenic epitopes of the vaccines may be responsible for the lower VE [24].
    As compared with VE in non-IC adults (41%), VE in IC adults was significantly lower (5%)
    during this season. This lower VE among IC adults is unlikely to be an artifact, because the
    findings are consistent with the immunogenicity studies of inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs)
                                                                                                                                     10

    that have demonstrated significantly reduced humoral immune responses to standard IIVs in
    immunosuppressed patients with HIV, organ transplants, cancer, and those receiving
    immunosuppressants [14]. In this network, influenza vaccination rate among controls was
    greater in the IC (60%) than in the non-IC group (54%), which is consistent with national US
    data in the insured population [25]. The higher vaccination rate among IC may be due to more
    frequent healthcare encounters and closer monitoring among IC patients offering more
    opportunities to vaccinate, or a heightened perception of risk for influenza complications by
    providers, leading to increased willingness to recommend influenza vaccine, and by patients,
    leading to greater willingness to receive vaccination.
    Limited data exist on the prevention of influenza infection on immunocompromised adults by
    vaccination. Most studies have focused on the measurement of humoral antibody response
    among patients with particular immunocompromising conditions and have reported significantly
    reduced humoral immune responses [15, 26, 27]. However, this approach disregards the
    relationship between clinical outcomes and immune response, the levels of antibody titers from
    previous immunizations that may cause overestimations of response, nor does it consider the
    role of cell-mediated immune response to vaccination in the prevention of influenza infection.
    While studies of high dose influenza vaccine have demonstrated improved antibody responses
    in adult organ transplant recipients and improved antibody responses and outcomes in adults
    older than 65 years of age as compared to standard dose vaccine, it is unknown if enhanced
    vaccine options, such as high dose and adjuvanted vaccines, could improve VE in
    immunocompromised groups [27-30]. Increasing the evidence base for informing the use of
    enhanced influenza vaccines in immunosuppressed populations is necessary for determining if
    these interventions might offer added value to standard influenza vaccines and potentially
    contribute to improving efficacy of these vaccines.

    A primary challenge in the study of influenza VE in IC individuals is the definition of
    immunocompromise. Immunocompromising conditions are heterogenous and the degree of
    immunosuppression among groups is challenging to quantify. Additionally, within a defined IC
    group, differences in the degree of immunosuppression are difficult to assess, based on clinical
    records. We considered ~34% of the adults hospitalized with an acute respiratory illness during
    the influenza season as being immunocompromised by pre-defining groups of
    immunocompromising conditions that were identified by ICD-10-CM codes for all medical
    encounters in the preceding year. To complement our case definition, we also analyzed the
    addition of CPT codes for chemotherapy administration, chemotherapeutic drugs recorded in
    the EMR, and a question at the time of enrollment about the receipt of chemotherapy or
    radiation therapy in the preceding 12 months. Although we did not collect other
    immunosuppressant and biological data, we identified a similar proportion of IC adults among
    those hospitalized with acute respiratory illness as identified in the study by Patel et al. that
    utilized MarketScan data to estimate the prevalence of immunosuppressive conditions and risk
    for acute respiratory illnesses [25].
    Findings of this study should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. Although we
    used an objective and systematic mechanism to identify the different IC groups, our
    identification of the immunocompromising groups accounts for only a rough measure of
    immunosuppression. We did not consider the presence of more than one immunocompromising
    condition, and we were unable to evaluate the effect of timing of vaccination in relation to the
    immunosuppression. We were unable to evaluate VE among different IC because of
    inadequate sample sizes. A study with a greater number of IC adults that allows for analyses of
    subgroups, virus subtypes, and different vaccine formulations is needed for definitive
    conclusions. Our study is also limited to a single season when vaccine was mismatched to the
                                                                                                                                     12

    circulating A/H3N2 viruses and thus may not be applicable to other influenza viruses. Data are
    also from 4 U.S. sites and may not be generalizable.
    Our study’s strengths include the use of a standardized protocol with symptom-based eligibility
    and comprehensive PCR testing to identify influenza cases and controls, a test-negative case
    control design and, recruitment in geographically diverse areas. Furthermore, our study shows
    that immunocompromising conditions can be identified based on EMR data, without the need for
    cumbersome medication reviews.
    Proper identification of IC groups in future VE studies will have implications for public policy
    development, such as a recommendation for a different vaccine formulation for IC groups, or a
    consideration for chemoprophylaxis for those with immunocompromise.
    Vaccine effectiveness against influenza was not significant among hospitalized
    immunocompromised patients. In light of our findings, decreasing the burden of influenza in IC
    individuals may be less dependent on improving their vaccine coverage than on improving
    vaccination rates of close contacts of the immunocompromised individual, thereby creating a
    circle of protection around an IC individual. Mathematical modeling has shown that even small
    improvements in VE and vaccine coverage are associated with substantial reductions in
    influenza burden [31].

    Figure 1 legend: Immunocompromised groups were mutually exclusive and followed the order
    listed here. As an example, if an individual had an ICD-10 code that classified him/her as an
    organ transplant, this individual was grouped in this category, even if he/she also had an ICD-10
    for chemotherapy.
