   3      Abstract
   4
   5      Objective
   6      The experiences of frontline healthcare professionals are essential in identifying strategies
   7      to mitigate the disruption to healthcare services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
   8
   9      Methods
  10      We conducted a cross-sectional study of TB and HIV professionals in low and middle-income
  11      countries       (LMIC).     Between       May     12   and   August    6  2020,    we    collected  qualitative      and
  12      quantitative data using an online survey in 11 languages. We used descriptive statistics and
  13      thematic analysis to analyse responses.
  14
  15      Findings
  16      669 respondents from 64 countries completed the survey. Over 40% stated that it was
  17      either impossible or much harder for TB and HIV patients to reach healthcare facilities since
  18      COVID-19. The           most common           barriers reported      to affect patients       were: fear of getting
  19      infected with SARS-CoV-2, transport disruptions and movement restrictions. 37% and 28%
  20      of responses about TB and HIV stated that healthcare provider access to facilities was also
  21      severely     impacted. Strategies            to address reduced transport needs and costs                 – including
  22      proactive coordination between the health and transport sector and cards that facilitate
  23      lower cost or easier travel - were presented in qualitative responses. Access to non-medical
  24      support for patients, such as food supplementation or counselling, was severely disrupted
  25      according        to  36%     and   31%      of  HIV    and   TB   respondents      respectively;   qualitative      data
  26      suggested that the need for such services was exacerbated.

  27      Conclusion
  28      Patients and healthcare providers across numerous LMIC faced substantial challenges in
  29      accessing       healthcare      facilities,    and    non-medical      support     for  patients  was     particularly
  30      impacted. Synthesising recommendations of frontline professionals should be prioritised for
  31      informing policymakers and healthcare service delivery organisations.

  35      Introduction
  36
  37      The direct health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are colossal, and are continuing to
  38      grow, with approximately one million deaths directly attributed to COVID-19 (1). However,
  39      researchers and practitioners have already highlighted that the indirect effects of COVID-19
  40      on global health - through the disruption of essential healthcare services - may be even
  41      larger and longer lasting (2, 3).
  42
  43      TB   and    HIV     are   the   two     infectious     diseases    that   cause   the  highest    number   of   deaths
  44      globally; in 2018, 1.5 and 1.1 million people died from TB and from HIV-related illnesses
  45      respectively        (5,   6).  National       programmes        for   controlling    these    diseases  already     face
  46      immense         challenges,       and     the   pandemic       has   increased    these    by   diverting  healthcare
  47      professionals        and    resources       to  contain    COVID-19      (7, 8).  Evidence     from  the  Ebola    crisis
  48      provides a warning of the reversals in progress that accompany a pandemic; for example,
  49      significant      decreases       in   diagnoses      of  smear-positive       TB,  HIV   testing   and  antiretroviral
  50      therapy uptake in Liberia have been documented (9). A modelling study estimating the
  51      impact of severe disruptions to service delivery predicted that HIV and TB deaths could
  52      increase      by    up   to   10%     and    20%    over    five  years    respectively    in  high-burden   settings,
  53      reverting to levels seen a decade ago(10).
  54
  55      Policies to minimise disruptions to TB and HIV care must be put in place urgently. To do this,
  56      we need to understand the range of impacts of COVID-19 on TB and HIV services, and
  57      identify feasible strategies for mitigation. Information from frontline health professionals
  58      and researchers is invaluable and often insufficiently incorporated into policy planning or in
                                                                                                                                  3

  59      the formation of research questions (11, 12). In light of this, our study rapidly synthesised
  60      information from professionals working in affected countries, in order to identify both how
  61      COVID-19        is   impacting     TB     and    HIV   services    in  LMIC    and   their   recommendations          for
  62      minimising disruptions.
  63
  64      Methods
  65
  66      We    analysed        quantitative      and    qualitative   data   collected    through    a  rapid   cross-sectional
  67      survey of TB and HIV healthcare delivery, management and research professionals in LMIC
  68      around the world.
  69
  70      Study design, population and sampling
  71      Our    open      online     survey      was    conducted      between      May     12  and    August     6 2020.     The
  72      methodology           was    designed       based     on   a   standardised       checklist   for   internet  surveys
  73      (CHERRIES) (13). Our target population was individuals who were involved in managing or
  74      delivering TB or HIV services, including,                  but not limited       to: doctors,    nurses, community
  75      healthcare        providers,      laboratory       technicians,      policymakers,      health    facility managers,
  76      representatives of charity, community or advocacy groups, and researchers.
  77
  78      We used three approaches to share the invitation to complete our survey. First, we sent
  79      information through online professional platforms and personal networks with colleagues
  80      (using email, WhatsApp or Twitter). Second, we hired one focal point for Asia, one for Latin
  81      America, and one for Africa. Focal points focused on contacting local organisations in their
  82      regions. Third, we used snowball sampling, whereby survey participants were asked to share
                                                                                                                                  4

  83      the    survey      with     others     who     might    have    information      to   contribute.   Through       these
  84      approaches, the survey was shared with over 250 professional networks and organisations.
  85
  86      Survey
  87      The survey was initially designed in English by an international team with diverse expertise
  88      in TB and HIV control working in Europe, Asia and Africa. It was first piloted with eight
  89      professionals working in Cambodia, The Gambia, South Africa, The Philippines, Pakistan,
  90      Zambia and Zimbabwe; this allowed us to check face validity and refine the wording of
  91      questions       and     response      options.     Following     this,  we   piloted    an  electronic   version      (in
  92      SurveyMonkey)            with    five    public    health    professionals      to  check   the   accessibility      and
  93      functionality of the survey as it appeared on the online platform.
  94
  95      Using SurveyMonkey enabled us to administer a survey that could only be answered once
  96      per device, and did not collect identifying information. We provided introductory text and a
  97      downloadable information sheet on the landing page. Respondents gave consent - after
  98      reading the information sheet - by checking boxes to confirm that they agreed to participate
  99      and allowed text responses to be quoted verbatim. It was possible for participants to agree
 100      to participate, but to decline use of verbatim quotes.
 101
 102      We used adaptive questioning, whereby nine HIV or TB- specific questions, or 18 covering
 103      both, were displayed based depending on which areas the respondent wanted to provide
 104      information about. Of the nine questions, seven were multiple choice (Table 2), with space
 105      to add free text using the ‘other’ option. There were two open response questions that only
 106      collected free text and these constitute the qualitative responses. The first asked about
                                                                                                                                  5

 107      COVID-19 related rules that have been introduced by the government and how these have
 108      impacted TB/HIV health services. The second solicited information about measures that can
 109      be taken (or have already been taken) to minimize disruptions. There was no limit to the
 110      amount of text a respondent could insert.
 111
 112      The survey and participant information sheet were translated into 10 additional languages:
 113      Arabic, Bahasa, Chinese, French, Portuguese, Russian, Shona, Spanish, Swahili, and Urdu.
 114      There were at least two translators for each language, so that every translation was checked
 115      by an independent native or fluent speaker.
 116      Data management and analysis
 117      All  data      was    downloaded          into   MS    Excel.   The   quantitative      data  was   analysed      using
 118      descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages) in Stata/SE V.14 (StatCorp, Texas, USA).
 119
 120      Our    qualitative      analysis    involved     translating    non-English      language   text  into  English,     and
 121      conducting        a  thematic      analysis.     We    used   an   interpretive    approach    in  which    identified
 122      themes were supported by the data. The thematic analysis process began by two authors
 123      agreeing on the emerging themes after reading the text responses independently and then
 124      coding the text line by line manually. Finally, we triangulated qualitative and quantitative
 125      results to validate findings.
 126
 127      Ethical Approval
 128      We received ethical approval from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the
 129      University of Zambia and The South African Medical Association.

 130      Results
 131
 132      Of the 923 respondents that initiated the consent process and accessed survey questions,
 133      669 (72%) from 64 countries completed it. 567 respondents answered the TB section, and
 134      346 answered the HIV section. There was a greater representation of health professional
 135      based in sub-Saharan African countries in responses about HIV as compared to TB (Figure 1).
 136      Demographic and professional characteristics of respondents are in Table 1.

 142      Access to healthcare facilities for patients and providers
 143      Our survey indicated that access to healthcare facilities for TB and HIV healthcare providers
 144      and patients has been substantially affected (Table 2).                    Over 40% of respondents stated that
 145      it was impossible or much harder for TB and HIV patients to reach healthcare facilities since
 146      COVID-19. Similarly, it was much harder or impossible for TB healthcare providers to reach
 147      their place of work since COVID-19 began, according to 37% of respondents. Challenges

 153      Concerns       and    barriers    for    TB   and   HIV   patients    to  access   healthcare   were    similar.     The
 154      following were identified by more than 50% of respondents: fear of getting infected with
 155      SARS-CoV-2, transport disruptions, movement restrictions owing to lockdowns and reduced
 156      income. Disruption            to transport services         was    a recurring theme in the       qualitative data,
 157      mentioned over 30 times across Asian, African and Latin American countries. Specifically, it
 158      was highlighted that both reduced access to usual modes of transport and increased cost of
 159      transport created barriers to reaching healthcare facilities for both healthcare providers and
 160      patients. Furthermore, the impact of transport disruptions on essential supplies reaching
 161      healthcare facilities was noted repeatedly as an issue to address:                          Monitor the lockdown
 162      enforcement to make sure it really doesn't hamper movement of essential items; other
 163      endemic diseases should not be neglected due to COVID-19. [M, doctor, Nigeria].                                  Three
 164      policies to address transport disruptions suggested were: proactive coordination between
 165      the health and transport sector (including private transport companies); cards that facilitate
 166      lower cost or easier travel for patients and providers, and public information to reassure
 167      patients that they can travel for healthcare.
 168
 169      Alternative solutions, suggested by over 40 respondents, focused on ways to reduce the
 170      need for patients to travel to healthcare facilities. These solutions relied on bringing services
 171      closer to patients’ homes, and providing medication for longer durations. As an adaptation
 172      to  COVID-19 situation,           it   was    commonly      reported     that  medicines    for TB   and    HIV    were
 173      allowed to be given for several months at one time; some responses indicated challenges in
 174      doing this due to insufficient supplies. Provision of HIV and TB medicines to cover longer
 175      periods,     however,        does   not     address    the   need    for  patients   to  interact  with   healthcare
 176      providers       as   part    of  treatment        monitoring     and    follow-up    support.   Telemedicine        was

 177      identified as a solution by more than 50 respondents. This was reported to be operating in
 178      some facilities in countries such as Argentina and South Africa, and was proposed as a way
 179      of   providing        better    services       in  the   future,    even    outside     of  a  health    emergency.
 180      Antiretrovirals are handed out at home to avoid patient exposure…a telephone line was
 181      implemented for access to consultations through telemedicine. [F, manager of health facility,
 182      Argentina]
 183
 184      Recommendations              to   bring      healthcare     closer    to   communities       included    delivery      of
 185      counselling and medicines through community volunteers or local private providers, and
 186      setting up community collection points. Numerous respondents encouraged flexibility in
 187      where patients are allowed to collect medicines, since some patients may relocate to their
 188      villages from urban areas when employment opportunities are affected.
 189
 190      Disruptions to service provision at TB and HIV facilities
 191      Over 70% of respondents reported that TB and HIV facilities had revised their operating
 192      procedures to include physical distancing protocols for patients, and over 70% also reported
 193      that TB and HIV facilities had introduced Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for healthcare
 194      providers. The importance of PPE, and masks in particular, was mentioned commonly (35
 195      times for healthcare providers and 20 times for patients) across numerous countries. We
 196      noted a difference           in whether respondents stressed the need for masks specifically for
 197      doctors, or for other providers such as laboratory technicians and community healthcare
 198      workers. We also found that some doctors and healthcare managers emphasised the need
 199      for education         on   infection     prevention practices in conjunction with increased access                     to
 200      masks.       Concerns were raised about a lack of clarity on who should be responsible for
                                                                                                                                  1

 201      providing PPE, and the cost burden on poorer patients if they are required to source their
 202      own     masks:       Most TB patients are poor. They cannot afford masks and sanitizer [F,
 203      researcher, Pakistan]
 204
 205      Only 16% and 11% of HIV and TB respondents reported that standard medical treatment
 206      was very difficult or impossible to provide. In contrast, we found that access to non-medical
 207      support for patients, such as food supplementation (where available) or counselling, was
 208      much     harder      or   impossible       to   access   according    to   36%    and   31%  of  respondents        that
 209      answered questions about HIV and TB respectively. Less than 20% said that these important
 210      services     were     unchanged.         Furthermore,       the  qualitative    data   suggested   that   nutritional
 211      support       became        particularly       critical when      movement        restrictions  and    employment
 212      instability further reduced access to income and food. A repeated suggestion was that food
 213      supplementation should be paired with community-based delivery of drug supplies:                                   Poor
 214      patients also miss the nutrition they used to receive at the TB facilities. Provide nutrition with
 215      the drug supplies [M, health facility manager, Somalia]
 216
 217      While many respondents advocated for the upkeep of counselling services for patients, the
 218      need for mental health support for providers was not mentioned. Increased workload and
 219      stress was mentioned as a problem, but few provided solutions. The solutions mentioned
 220      included financial incentives to compensate for the increased occupational risk and hiring of
 221      additional healthcare providers to account for the greater work load. Shift working systems
 222      were also suggested to reduce the number of healthcare providers in facilities at any given
 223      time, especially in space-limited settings such as laboratories.

 225      Impacts on supply chains and diagnostic services
 226      There were mixed views on challenges around the provision of routine diagnostic services
 227      for   TB    and     HIV,    indicating      that    the  experiences       of  respondents     varied  considerably.
 228      Approximately          one     third    reported      that  providing    diagnostic     services  had  been    slightly
 229      harder and a similar proportion reported no change since COVID-19, while 29% and 24%
 230      reported      that    TB   and    HIV     diagnostic    services    were    very hard    or  impossible  to   provide.
 231      Qualitative data indicated that countries with more centralised production or storage of
 232      essential supplies might face greater challenges in maintaining supply chains for diagnostics
 233      due    to   greater      reliance     on    transport.     Similarly,   where    diagnostics    were  not   produced
 234      domestically,        risk  of   disruptions       increased,   according      to  the  qualitative  data.  Suggested
 235      solutions      included       shifting     to   quality-assured      local  production     and   decentralisation      of
 236      diagnostics wherever possible.
 237
 238      Stigma
 239      Qualitative responses highlighted increased stigmatisation of HIV and TB patients owing to
 240      changes      in  the    delivery     of   health     services.  Examples      provided    by  respondents    included
 241      stigmatisation when HIV patients were asked to show health cards in order to travel, when
 242      patients presenting with TB symptoms were first isolated and tested for COVID-19, and
 243      when attention is drawn to HIV or TB patients in their neighbourhoods during community-
 244      based distribution of medicines.

 250      together with other types of assistance to protect the identity of those wishing for health
 251      status anonymity. [F, community healthcare worker, Dominican Republic]
 252
 253      Another strong theme was fear and stigma of COVID-19. It was frequently reported that
 254      people were worried that healthcare providers or community members would think they
 255      had    COVID-19        if  they  sought       care  for  TB.   This   was   identified   as   a  priority  area  to   be
 256      addressed:       Need to reduce stigma about COVID-19 and associations with TB. [M, manager,
 257      Kenya]
 258
 259      Discussion
 260      Our multi-country survey provides current evidence of the widespread impacts of COVID-19
 261      on   TB    and    HIV     patients,    healthcare      providers    and   delivery    of  routine    services.  It  also
 262      identifies specific policies and service delivery                   adaptations    that can be      implemented       to
 263      mitigate disruptions. We summarise three key disruptions and their implications. First, we
 264      found     that    disruptions      to    transport     services    posed    substantial     challenges    not  only    to
 265      patients,      but   also    to healthcare       providers.    Second,     our   data   indicated    that   addressing
 266      transport challenges alone would not be sufficient, owing to the barrier posed by patients’
 267      fears   of   contracting       SARS-CoV-2.        Third,   in terms    of  disruption    to   service  provision,    the
 268      reduction in patient access to critical non-medical support was striking. Less than 20% of
 269      respondents stated that access to non-medical support was unaffected. As suggested by our
 270      qualitative      data     and   other     studies    (14-16),   mitigating    disruptions      to provision   of   food
 271      supplementation            and   mental        health   support     is critical   due    to   the  increased    stress,
 272      unemployment and loss of income caused by health emergencies.

 274      Frontline professionals identified important solutions to minimise disruptions from health
 275      emergencies.         Health service adaptations to reduce the need for long journeys to healthcare
 276      facilities,     included:       community-based            kiosks    to    enable     collection   of    medication,
 277      telemedicine services and telephone helplines. Some of these were proposed as sustainable
 278      improvements for healthcare delivery that could be adopted even outside of emergency
 279      situations. Practical strategies to address barriers to using transport services for accessing
 280      healthcare and to improve healthcare provider motivation and safety were also identified.
 281
 282      Researchers         have     concluded        that   health   system     resilience    entails  a  combination         of
 283      absorptive,       adaptive      and    transformative       strategies   (20).   For   example,   overcrowding         of
 284      urban health can at least partly be overcome by community-based care and telemedicine.
 285      However, the consequences of ongoing adaptations on health outcomes and the impacts of
 286      changes in service delivery on stigma and equity must be constantly examined. For example,
 287      home delivery of medications may impact the former, while reliance on access to a phone
 288      for telemedicine services may impact the latter.
 289
 290      Complex        health     systems     consist     of  both   hardware(infrastructure,        commodities,      human
 291      resources and finances) and software (knowledge, values, norms, and feelings that shape
 292      health service delivery) (21). Our study indicated that the software of health systems, such
 293      as mental health and motivation of healthcare workers, both of which are known to be
 294      affected in outbreak situations, was being neglected by current responses to COVID-19 (22).
 295
                                                                                                                                  5

 296      Finally,    our     study    demonstrates         that   frontline     professional    in   LMICs  have    invaluable
 297      experience, and that sharing information between organisations in the same country and
 298      across LMIC should be facilitated. Solutions applied in one country could be adapted for use
 299      in another LMIC, and may be more appropriate than policies designed by decision makers
 300      who are less embedded in the realities of LMIC health services (17-19).
 301
 302      Although there are important strengths of our survey-based study, such as rapid gathering
 303      of data in low technology settings, and the wide array of countries we received data from,
 304      we    acknowledge          that   bias     can   result   from     1)   the  non-representative      nature    of    the
 305      population       sampled       and     2)   the   self-selection     of  participants.    Though   the   survey     was
 306      available in 11 languages, we missed professionals who speak other languages and we were
 307      informed by colleagues in some countries (Russia and China) that participants did not feel
 308      comfortable responding to such a survey. We also received more responses about TB than
 309      HIV.
 310
 311      Conclusions
 312      Data from this first multi-country survey focusing on experiences of frontline professionals
 313      showed that challenges to accessing healthcare facilities and maintaining routine service
 314      delivery – particularly in relation to diagnostics and non-medical support - were substantial
 315      across    LMIC      following     COVID-19.       Frontline    professionals     identified   important    mitigation
 316      strategies, including adaptations to reduce the costs or need for patients and providers to
 317      travel    to    healthcare       facilities,    measures      to    address    healthcare     provider   safety      and
 318      motivation,       and approaches           to tackle    increases     in stigma. These professionals, who are
 319      deeply involved in delivering, managing or analysing service delivery during emergencies
                                                                                                                                  6

 320      such as COVID-19, will not have the time or connections to influence planning of policies,
 321      despite     having      insights   that     are   critical  for effective    policy   setting.  Rapid   synthesis      of
 322      information them can facilitate identification of service delivery barriers and bottlenecks
 323      presenting         during     emergency          situations,    and    help     develop     effective   adaptations.
 324      Furthermore, some of the emerging changes to healthcare delivery models could support
 325      better resilience against future emergencies.

          Abstract
          Objective
          The experiences of frontline healthcare professionals are essential in identifying strategies
          to mitigate the disruption to healthcare services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
          Methods
          We conducted a cross-sectional study of TB and HIV professionals in low and middle-income
          countries       (LMIC).     Between       May     12   and  August    6   2020,    we    collected  qualitative      and
          quantitative data using an online survey in 11 languages. We used descriptive statistics and
          thematic analysis to analyse responses.
          Findings
          669 respondents from 64 countries completed the survey. Over 40% stated that it was
          either impossible or much harder for TB and HIV patients to reach healthcare facilities since
          COVID-19. The           most common           barriers reported      to affect patients       were: fear of getting
          infected with SARS-CoV-2, transport disruptions and movement restrictions. 37% and 28%
          of responses about TB and HIV stated that healthcare provider access to facilities was also
          severely     impacted. Strategies            to address reduced transport needs and costs                 – including
          proactive coordination between the health and transport sector and cards that facilitate
          lower cost or easier travel - were presented in qualitative responses. Access to non-medical
          support for patients, such as food supplementation or counselling, was severely disrupted
          according       to   36%     and   31%      of  HIV    and   TB   respondents      respectively;   qualitative      data
          suggested that the need for such services was exacerbated.

          Conclusion
          Patients and healthcare providers across numerous LMIC faced substantial challenges in
          accessing       healthcare      facilities,    and    non-medical      support     for   patients was     particularly
          impacted. Synthesising recommendations of frontline professionals should be prioritised for
          informing policymakers and healthcare service delivery organisations.
