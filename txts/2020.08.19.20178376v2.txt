Plain Language Summary
Three companion clinical studies from the University of Minnesota examined the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)
when given to treat early cases of COVID-19 or to prevent it from occurring either before or just after exposure to
someone with coronavirus. Although reductions in COVID-19 between 17% and 27% were found when HCQ was
used before or just after exposure to COVID-19, because the studies had too few patients in them and because they
were designed to find larger differences, these effects were not statistically significant, even though, they may have
been clinically meaningful. Furthermore, larger reductions of COVID-19 were found within sub-groups, reaching for
example in one study 45% for younger patients (<40), 40% in women and 64% in first responders. Confounding the
data was the unplanned use of zinc and vitamin C.
In our initial review of the publicly released data from one of the studies, we discovered an issue that fundamentally
alters its interpretation as well as one of its companion studies. According to their published reports, and understood
by many others citing this work (including NIH), treatment with HCQ began within four days of either exposure or
onset of symptoms. Because shipping schedules were not considered, this delay could have been 7.5 days and many
patients may not have received drug in time to have an effect, if there was one. After we requested additional data,
we found that HCQ may reduce COVID-19 by as much as 65% when given within 3 days of exposure and we have
requested more data to clarify this figure further.
We plan therefore to conduct a re-analysis of all three studies to explore how the effects of HCQ, if any, might be
dependent on time, age, gender, and type of exposure to COVID-19. This will enable us to conduct clinical studies
to confirm or refute what we think we have learned from this work.
Abstract
BACKGROUND: Three companion randomized pragmatic trials were recently published assessing the effect of
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP - “Rajasingham,” NCT04328467), post- exposure
prophylaxis (PEP - “Boulware,” NCT04308668) and treatment of early COVID-19 (“Skipper,” NCT04308668).
Respectively, they found non-statistically significant reductions in development or persistence of COVID of 17%, 27%
and 20% and concluded that HCQ did not reduce, prevent or substantially treat COVID-19 illness.
With a likely Type 2 error and over ambitious powering (50% effect), these effects may impact trajectory and resource
models that drive decisions on lockdowns. All three studies have signals mostly found in the data appendices that
suggest useful effects of HCQ in sub-groups worthy of re-analysis and prospective exploration. HCQ appeared to
benefit younger rather than older patients in both the PrEP and PEP studies with respective reductions in COVID-19
of 45% and 36%. There was a strong benefit (40%) of HCQ in women (PrEP). Response to HCQ appeared to vary
by type of exposure, with a large benefit (64%) in first responders (PrEP) and in household contacts (31%, PEP).
Further confounding the data was the undefined, ex-protocol use of zinc and ascorbic acid.
INTERIM FINDINGS: A major impediment in interpreting the PEP and treatment studies concerns the estimation of
the time from exposure or symptom onset to treatment. Our initial analysis of the PEP study as published revealed a
negative correlation between treatment lag and disease reduction, reaching 49% when HCQ was initiated within one
day (RR 0.51, CI 0.176-1.46, p=0.249). However, our initial review (pursuant to this protocol, v1.1) of the publicly
released PEP dataset revealed that, contrary to the study’s conclusion, this four-day period referred not to the time
from exposure to treatment as we (and others) had understood, but to the time from exposure and enrollment, a
difference of up to 3.5 days. Our re-stratification of new data we had requested revealed that HCQ may reduce the
development of COVID-19 by as much as 65% (RR 0.35, CI 0.13-0.93, p=0.044) when received within 3 days of
exposure (RR 0.83 at 3-5 days; RR 1.37 at 5-7 days). There remains ambiguity in these estimates addressable by
further data we have requested.
This same issue appears shared by the Treatment study. Further, patients in the PEP study were likely exposed to
a series, rather than a single, “index” exposure, an issue possibly shared with the PrEP study. In the treatment study,
there may be a bimodal effect of responders and non-responders, in whom symptoms may actually worsen. All three
studies share the confounding effect of a possibly active folate placebo.
OBJECTIVES: To conduct a post hoc exploratory re-analyses of the de-identified raw datasets from randomized
studies of the use of HCQ for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, and treatment of early of COVID-19 with view to
further defining: (a) The time dependent effect of HCQ, on post exposure prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19;

this study.

incorporating the WHO Trial Registration Data Set.

1.3     Description
          1.3.1 Rationale
This protocol involves the exploratory re-analysis of three companion studies examining the effect of HCQ in pre-1
(PrEP) and post-2 (PEP) exposure prophylaxis, as well as Treatment3 of early COVID-19 in North America.
This work is being performed to clarify a number of questions arising from:
     •    The original publication of the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)2 study that prompted our previously
          registered version 1.1 of this protocol.
     •    The publicly released dataset for the PEP study. Our initial review of this dataset has identified a key issue
          not obvious in the original publication which requires this protocol revision. Further, additional clarifying data
          has been requested from the original authors before we can proceed with our analysis.
     •    The two companion studies for pre-exposure (PrEP) prophylaxis1 and treatment2 of early COVID-19. Given
          that these are companion studies, a number of issues are shared between them 4 (Table 1 of Supplement).
          Accordingly, re-analysis of these two studies has been added in this protocol revision (1.2).
A fourth companion study,5 not the subject of this protocol, examined the safety aspects of the other three studies
and concluded: “randomized clinical trials can safely investigate whether hydroxychloroquine is efficacious for
COVID-19.”
A full discussion of the issues that have provided the rationale for this re-analysis is given in the Supplemental file. In
summary these issues requiring further exploration are:
Revised understanding of the time from exposure to treatment necessitating re-analysis
Based on a comment from the original principal investigator to us in early correspondence that there may be a “Day
1” effect shown in the original supplemental data for the PEP study, we and others6 found a statistically significant
negative correlation (Figure 1 of Supplement) between treatment lag and reduction of COVID-19, reaching 49% when

given within one day after exposure (RR 0.51, CI 0.176-1.46, p=0.249). Based on the wording of the paper itself, our
initial understanding that the data described the effects of HCQ given up to four days after exposure to COVID-19
was shared by a number of others6-11
Pursuant to the earlier registered version (1.1) of this protocol, as we familiarized ourselves with the publicly released
dataset, we discovered that this four-day period did not take into account the time to ship study medication, adding
up to 3.5 days to the time lag (Table 2 of Supplement). In response to our requests, the authors provided new data
to address this issue, at least partially. We re-stratified the dataset and found that HCQ may reduce the development
of COVID-19 by as much as 65% (RR 0.35, CI 0.13-0.93, p=0.044) when received within 3 days of exposure (Table
3 of Supplement) with a declining effect thereafter (RR 0.83 at 3-5 days; RR 1.37 at 5-7 days). Other ambiguity in
estimating the treatment lag (see Supplement) should be addressable by further data we have requested.
Stratification by time is an essential element in understanding this study and must be performed before other
subgroup analyses can proceed.
A similar issue appears to exist for the Treatment study3 which may account for the apparent bimodal effect
(“improvers” vs. “non-improvers”) we discerned in the published data4 which suggest that since only 24% and 30%
of participants accounting for the 14-day VAS of 1.5 (HCQ) and 1.87 (placebo) respectively, average scores in still-
symptomatic patients increased to 6.15 and 6.14 in the two groups respectively.
Time bias related to excluded subjects
There may be time-related biases related to the exclusion of 100 randomized PEP study subjects who became
symptomatic before study drug was received.
Age-based subgroups
Because of the need for time-based re-stratification, reductions in COVID-19 in younger subjects of similar orders of
magnitude in the PEP and PrEP studies (Figure 1 Supplement) require sub-stratification. Because different age
categories were used in the PrEP study than in the PEP and Treatment studies, age strata should be matched.
Gender-based subgroups
A reduction in COVID-19 found for women in the PrEP study (HR 0.60, CI 0.36-0.99, p=0.051) requires exploration
for time and age interaction.
Type and level of exposure to COVID-19
There were also differences in development of COVID-19 by type of exposure (HCW vs. household in the PEP study;
First Responders in the PrEP study) worthy of further exploration.
Observational use of Zinc and Vitamin C
The PEP and Treatment studies included the ex-protocol use of zinc and Vitamin C. Re-analysis will attempt to clarify
the contribution of these agents. In the Treatment study,3 zinc or Vitamin C alone may have been somewhat effective
without HCQ.4
Use of folate for placebo
Further confounding the study is the use of folate for the placebo which may have either inhibitory of enhancing
effects on COVID-19 (Supplement). The PEP study included Canadian subjects who used a lactose placebo, subjects
not taking study medication, and subjects lost to follow up or withdrawing consent. Adjusting for these subjects, we
generated “folate only placebo” and “no folate control” cohorts, with a possibly lower risk of COVID-19 in the “no
folate control” cohort than the folate placebo cohort (RR0.93, 95%CI 0.54-1.61) (Table 5 of Supplement). Since folate
was used in all three studies, this possible effect of folate will be considered in the sub-group re-analyses for all three
studies.
          1.3.2     Overall Aims, Objectives, Methods
Overall Aims
Accordingly, the now publicly released and revised dataset for the PEP study as well as the (as yet unreleased)
datasets for the related and overlapping PrEP and mild disease Treatment studies may reveal important clues to
inform an age-, time- and gender nuanced approach to COVID-19 using hydroxychloroquine testable by prospective

studies. Data from a two similarly designed post-exposure12 or early treatment13 studies conducted in Spain (both
NCT04304053), with directionally similar results may soon become available for similar analyses.
Further examination of these data may also provide insight into the various proposed mechanisms of HCQ. At early
stages, consistent with incubation period estimates of 3-8 days14, HCQ alone may be effective in pre-emption
because it interferes with viral attachment and initial infectivity. Using zinc (or Vitamin C) may be futile, ineffective or
counterproductive in otherwise healthy individuals with no zinc dysregulation. HCQ may be sufficient in young people,
however once infection has occurred, HCQ’s actions as an ionophore 15 may be more important, and require the
presence of zinc for viral inhibition.16
Objectives
To conduct more detailed analyses of the raw datasets relating to the use of HCQ for pre- and post-exposure
prophylaxis, and treatment of early of COVID-19 with view to further defining:
      a) The time dependent effect of HCQ, on post exposure prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.
      b) The age dependent effect of HCQ, on pre- and post- exposure prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.
      c) The sub-stratification of gender, time- and age-dependent effects by exposure type and risk level, as well as
          by the use of zinc and ascorbic acid.
      d) The design of future clinical trials designed to test the hypotheses generated by this study.
Methods
A post hoc exploratory re-analysis will be conducted of a dataset obtained from randomized, controlled studies on
the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat or prevent COVID-19. This re-analysis will be expanded should datasets from
two similar Spanish studies become available. The re-analysis will explore apparent exposure risk, age and time-
nuanced effects of HCQ with three main hypotheses given below.
This protocol was devised using the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT)
17,18 incorporating the WHO Trial Registration Data Set 19 which it references.
1.4     Hypotheses
      a) That HCQ exerts a negative age-dependent effect in reducing COVID-19 when given prophylactically before
          or after exposure.
      b) The HCQ exerts a negative time-dependent effect in reducing COVID-19 when given prophylactically after
          exposure, or for treatment after onset of symptoms.
      c) That any gender, age- and time-dependent effects of HCQ will be further dependent on type and risk level of
          exposure and the use of zinc or ascorbic acid.
2      DESIGN PLAN
2.1     Study type
This study is a post hoc exploratory analysis of a now revised dataset obtained from an original study 2 that was a
randomized, controlled, blinded clinical trial with a pragmatic design with participants from the USA and Canada. Part
of the data related to the use of zinc and ascorbic acid which were observational in nature. This study seeks to
conduct similar analyses on as yet unreleased datasets from two companion studies. 1,3 Data from similarly designed
open label, early treatment13 or open-label, cluster randomized post-exposure prophylaxis12 studies conducted in
Spain, if available, will be subjected to similar analyses.
2.2     Blinding
All three companion studies1-3 were double-blinded studies. The Spanish post-exposure prophylaxis study12 was an
open-label, cluster-randomized trial. Its companion13 early treatment study was also open label.
2.3     Is there any additional blinding in this study?
Details of blinding, implementation of allocation, enrollment, assignment of interventions and unblinding may be found
in the publicly-released documentation for the original studies. No further blinding will be employed for the purposes
of this exploratory re-analysis.

2.4     Study design
The original studies were interventional studies that used COVID-19 related endpoints to compare the performance
of two groups - HCQ treatment vs. or placebo-2 or no-12 treatment. The current protocol will further stratify data by
age-, treatment-lag, gender, exposure type and risk level and zinc and ascorbic acid use.
2.5     Randomization
Details of randomization are found in the publicly-released documentation for the original studies. No further
randomization will be employed for the purposes of this exploratory re-analysis. Zinc and ascorbic acid were used in
two studies,2,3 (and possibly one other1) but this use was not part of the protocol and was uncontrolled. Accordingly,
data concerning zinc and ascorbic acid are considered as retrospective and observational.
3      SAMPLING PLAN
3.1     Existing data
The three companion1-3 North American studies and two Spanish12,13 studies have been published and examined
along with their supplementary summary statistics released at the time of publication.
The raw dataset for the first (Boulware)2 of these has been released and has been transmitted by email to us by the
original authors and was accessed after registration of version 1.1 of this protocol. On 8/20/20 the raw dataset was
downloaded from:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hQS21AN3pJk1Ehm85OdDeoUut3i-b8wt
This consisted of two files named:
NEJM_Contents_DataDictionary_17July2020.csv (7kb)
NEJM_PEP_PublicDataSet_17July2020.csv (281kb)
After accessing these data, a quality control check found a number of discrepancies with the published study for
tallies of several study variables. Clarification was sought from the study authors on these points as well as other
aspects of the of data, most notably questions relating to:
      •   Calculation of the time from exposure to drug receipt (see 1.3)
      •   Data from 100 randomized but excluded patients who became symptomatic before receipt of study drug.
      •   Identification of patients who did not take any drug, or who did not complete the course of drug.
      •   Use of folate as placebo
      •   Exposure risk based on use of PPE
Acknowledging the errors, the authors transmitted to us a revised dataset on 9/9/20 consisting of two files:
PEP_DataDictionary_09Sep2020.csv (10kb)
PEP_Public_Data_09Sep2020.csv (288kb)
Our quality control check on this revised dataset confirmed the agreement of variable tallies with those found in the
published paper as well as the correction of the discrepancies previously identified. Clarification was provided
regarding the use of folate and the identification of subjects fully, partially or non-adherent to the study medication.
Regarding our remaining question regarding assessment of exposure risk, we were informed that the definition of
exposure risk stated in the paper was incorrect and required correction. The study authors were not prepared to
provide data for the excluded 100 patients as those data would be later released as part of the dataset for the
companion (sharing the same NCT registration) study,3 although according to that publication, deidentified participant
data was to be made available from July 22 2020.
Regarding the calculation of exposure to drug receipt time, a new file was transmitted containing further information
about the time from enrollment to the receipt of study drug:
PEP_Exposure_to_MedArrival_time.csv (9kb)
The parameter provided was the sum of two numbers:
      - The integer number of days from exposure to screening(=enrollment) (as previously provided) plus
      - The actual number of hours (divided by 24) from time-stamped enrollment to time-stamped FEDEX delivery.

The calculation of this parameter was confirmed as the following example:
         A subject enrolled at 3pm on Monday and noted their days to exposure =1. The subject received drug the next morning
         at 10.30am (19.5 hours later) to produce a total exposure to arrival time (as provided) of 1 + 19.5/24 = 1.81 days. The
         exposure may have occurred just before midnight Sun-Mon in which case total time would be (15+19.5)/24 = 1.44 days,
         or just after midnight (Sat-Sunday) in which case the total time would be (15+24+20.5)/24 = 2.44 days. Further, since
         enrollment could have taken place at any time during a 24-hour period, these estimates are subject to an additional
         variation of + 24 hours.
Accordingly, we renewed our request for information regarding the time (of day) of enrollment that would narrow this
window for each subject and provide more accurate time stratification. Also, in response to our various questions, we
were informed that for the Canadian participants, same-day courier service was used, although the delivery lag was
not known. Since the particular data we requested may be protected by privacy regulations, we proposed means to
de-identify it whilst preserving its value for this re-analysis.
To help determine appropriate analyses, an interim estimate of the time-stratified effect of hydroxychloroquine on
development of COVID-19 was performed using these new (but incomplete) data and is given in Table 3 of the
Supplement. Further, data have been examined to determine the “Responding Population” of patients who provided
symptom data (5.5, Table 2).
Accordingly, data have been partially accessed, but additional requested data will permit more precise estimations
of the time from exposure to delivery, as well as the conduct of the other analyses.
The datasets for the companion1,3 and Spanish studies12 have not been released. Accordingly, this protocol revision
is being registered prior to accessing those data: As of the date of submission of this revised protocol, the data exist,
but have not been accessed by the sponsor or principal investigator.
3.2    Explanation of existing data
We have requested additional data that will permit more precise time stratification of the data. The kinds of analyses
to be performed will depend on whether this occurs and in what form.
3.3    Data collection procedures
Details of data collection procedures including inclusion and exclusion criteria are found in the publicly-released
documentation for the original studies. No further data collection will be employed for the purposes of this exploratory
re-analysis.
3.4    Sample size
Details of sample size are found in the publicly-released documentation for the original studies (Table 1).

4      VARIABLES
4.1     Manipulated variables
The manipulated variable (treatment arm) employed in the original studies is:
      Treatment, or pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 with levels as:
          • Treatment with HCQ (two dose intervals for pre-exposure prophylaxis study)
          • No (or placebo) treatment
Data will be stratified and sub- stratified by:
              • Subject age and gender
              • Time between exposure to COVID-19, or symptom onset and treatment.
              • Type of exposure (household vs. health worker contact etc.)
              • Level of exposure risk
              • Treatment with zinc or ascorbic acid
              • Full, partial and non-adherence to taking study drug with view to exploring the relationship between
                    the use of folate and COVID-19. Data from Canadian subjects taking lactose placebo, will be pooled
                    with data from subjects taking no study medication.
          Strata containing small numbers of subjects will be pooled with adjacent strata as appropriate and to meet
          sample size requirements of the tests to be employed.
4.2     Measured variables
The primary outcomes defined in the original studies were:
      • Presence of COVID-19, based on symptom-based criteria with expert review.2
      • Presence of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-1912
Secondary endpoints were:
      • Prevention of transmission of COVID-1912
4.3     Indices
The presence of symptom- or test- based COVID-19 will be expressed a percentage of the number of subjects for
each subgroup and Odds or Risk Ratios computed with 95% confidence intervals. Risk ratios may also be expressed
as its complement, the reduction of risk.
5      ANALYSIS PLAN
5.1     Statistical models
Fisher’s Exact or Chi Square tests will be used as appropriate to compare the incidence of COVID-19 in HCQ- and
control groups, for each sub-group stratification described above. If appropriate for the nature of the requested
data, univariate regression analyses will be conducted to examine the effect of age- and time lag on any effect of
HCQ. The possibility will be explored of conducting multivariate Cox regression analyses with propensity score
matching to examine observational data relating to the use of zinc and ascorbic acid. See also comments received
after version 1.0 of this protocol was registered from Dr. Boulware (section 5.6).
Should the dataset become available for the two Spanish12,13 studies, it may be possible to aggregate data with those
from the respective North American studies. As this is an exploratory analysis, no adjustment will be made for the
clustering used in the Spanish study.
5.2     Transformations
Depending on whether and what form remaining data are received concerning exposure to drug receipt time, other
possible analyses and the need for data transformation cannot yet be determined.
5.3     Inference criteria
Since all analyses performed in this protocol are exploratory in nature, p- values from two-tailed tests will be reported
if < 0.1 without adjustment for multiple comparisons.21

5.4     Data exclusion
The ability to conduct the planned analyses will depend on the format of the data remaining to be supplied.
5.5     Missing data
An Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis will be employed as was done in the original studies. As this protocol is exploratory
in nature, sensitivity analyses will not be conducted. Data will also be analyzed utilizing those subjects for whom
endpoint (symptom) data is present, as the “Responding Population” (RP) (Table 2).
For the PEP study, details of patients withdrawing consent (8) or lost to follow up (88, LTF) are provided in Figure 1
and Table S1 there. Of the 88 LTF patients, 52 were reported as not completing any surveys and were unresponsive
to follow up. Another 36 had: some survey data with vital status after day 14 known (16), no survey with vital status
after day 14 known (3) or no survey with vital status after day 14 unknown (17). We examined the 33 patients noted
as having some survey data and found that there were 9 with no symptom data. There is thus a total of 72 patients
with no symptom data at all which we will exclude from the Responding Population. The remaining 24 patients had
incomplete symptom data for days 3, 5, 10 and 14 in various combinations and will be included using the “last
observation carried forward” (LOCF) method with the endpoint adjudication determined by the original authors.

  Total included in Responding Population                              749      380        369
It is anticipated that we will handle missing data from the companion studies similarly.
5.6     Exploratory analysis
A per protocol analysis will be attempted to explore the effect, if any, of the folate placebo, by segregating data from
subjects according to their use of HCQ, folate, lactose or no study drug. We will construct “Folate placebo” and “No
folate Control” cohorts by aggregating patients noted as taking no study medication (regardless of randomization),
along with Canadian patients taking lactose placebo (Table 5 of Supplment)
Other relationships between the primary outcomes and demographic variables, as well as exposure type and level
will be explored.
Subsequent to the registration (https://osf.io/4akug) of version 1.0 of this protocol, we received the following
unsolicited but welcome suggestions from Dr. Boulware, the principal author of the first2 of the studies considered in
this protocol.
      a. “Along with doing the incorrect Watanabe linear regression analysis, consider doing the actual proper
          analysis for categorical data, which would be a logistic regression model with an interaction term for treatment
          group * exposure time group.”
          Response: The ability to conduct this type of analysis will depend on the level of data granularity which is as
          of this protocol version (1.1) unknown to us.
      b. “Look at the actual percentages by each of the subgroup days of exposure. There are some minor variation
          in the event rate between 12.7% to 17.9% between days in the placebo. As these are small subgroups, this
          creates artifact when looking at the difference. Consider, pooling the placebo event rate across the Day 1-4
          exposure groups. If you can say why the Day 2 placebo group incidence rate would be higher than Day 1 or
          3 or 4, sure keep it as is. If you pool the placebo together, the nice perfectly linear line is much less linear.
          For example, the day 2-3 HCQ incidence is 12% vs 12.2%, respectively. The placebo day 2-3 incidence is
          16.9% vs. 14.5%, respectively. If you want to say day 2 works great but not day 3, that’s a bit of a stretch.

           Yes, the difference is 4.9% vs 2.3% -- but this is an over-interpretation of the subgroup analysis – when the
           incidence of disease at day 2 and 3 is virtually the same with HCQ.”
           Response: The suggestion to pool the placebo data may be reasonable as there really should not be any
           difference by time and all we are seeing there is noise. However, there is still the possibility that folate has
           some activity [see 1.3], in which case pooling may not be appropriate.

In reviewing the released PEP data, we discovered that shipping times (up to 3.5 days) were not considered in the
published analysis. Requesting additional data, our re-stratification suggest that HCQ received within 3 days may
reduce illness by as much as 65%. Before proceeding, this finding necessitates protocol revision, further data
clarification, and the inclusion of companion studies sharing this and/or related issues.
