          Abstract
          Introduction: COVID-19 is characterised by hyperinflammation and coagulopathy. Severe cases
          often develop respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation and critical cases progressing to
          ARDS. Control of hyperinflammation has been proposed as a possible therapeutic avenue for COVID-
          19; extracorporeal blood purification (EBP) modalities offer an attractive mean to ameliorate
          maladaptive inflammation.
          With this work, we describe the longitudinal variation of parameters of systemic inflammation in
          critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with blood purification using AN69ST (oXiris®) hemodiafilter.
          Methods: We performed a time-series analysis of 44 consecutive COVID-19 cases treated with the
          AN69ST (oXiris ®) cytokine adsorbing hemodiafilter; we visualise longitudinal results of biochemical,
          inflammatory, blood gas- and vital sign parameters.
          Results: Blood purification was indicated for suspected hyperinflammation or hypercoagulation, (=
          CRP ≥ 100 mg/L and/or IL-6 ≥ 40 pg/mL and/or Ferritin ≥ 500 ng/mL and/or Lactate Dehydrogenase >
          365 U/L or D-dimers > 2000 ng/mL). All patients were treated with ≥ 1 cycle extracorporeal continuous
          venovenous hemofiltration (CVVHF) with cytokine adsorbing hemodiafilter (CAH); of these, 30 severe
          patients received CVVHF-CAH within 4 – 12 hours of hospitalisation. Another 14 patients admitted
          with mild-to-moderate symptoms progressed to severe disease and placed on EBP during the course
          of hospitalisation. The treatment was associated with a reduction of Ferritin, C-reactive protein,
          Fibrinogen, several inflammatory markers and a resolution of numerous cytopenias. The observed
          mortality across the cohort was 36.3% across the cohort.
          Conclusion: Extracorporeal blood purification with cytokine adsorbing hemofilter was associated with
          a decrease in the acute phase proteins CRP, Ferritin, and resolution of numerous cytopenias.
          Repetitive hemofiltration has been associated with lower levels of IL-6 in COVID-19 patients.

          Introduction
          The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic dominated our lives since the outbreak of the
          Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) started in Wuhan of Hubei
          Province, China [1]. Its disruptive nature was confirmed with the WHO`s classification as a global
          epidemic on February 28, 2020, [2].
          Severe COVID-19 disease is characterised by uncontrolled inflammation [3-5]. COVID-19 patients
          typically present with bilateral multifocal peripheral lung changes of ground-glass opacity and, or
          consolidation, on chest radiography [6] low peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and an increased
          respiratory rate strongly associated with pneumonia. Immunopathology [7, 8] is considered one of the
          main drivers of disease progression leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [9],
          multiorgan failure [10, 11, 5], secondary infections [12] and coagulopathy [13, 14].
          The use of blood purification devices has been advocated as a treatment option to mitigate atypical
          inflammation as a means to halt disease progression.
          We here describe a case series of 44 COVID-19 patients treated with CVVHF-CAH using the
          AN69ST (oXiris®) filter and present longitudinal analysis of clinical and laboratory parameters
          associated with disease severity. EBP was supplemented with systemic heparinisation and non-
          invasive respiratory [15] support aimed at preventing irreversible lung pathology [16] and the
          necessity of invasive mechanical ventilation. Mechanical respiratory support is linked to high mortality
          rates, especially in older patients or those with severe comorbidities [17].
          This prospective cohort study evaluated variation in several biomarkers, clinical parameters and
          outcome associated with EBP to control hyper inflammation. Institutional review board approval was
          obtained from the local ethical committee of the Zan Mitrev Clinic in accordance with the declaration
          of Helsinki and ICH-Good Clinical Practice.
                                                                                                                                1

          Biochemistry Analysis
          Blood samples were collected from each patient at the time-points shown for routine blood analysis:
          White blood cell count (WBC), Lymphocyte count (LYM), Neutrophil count (NEU), Thrombocyte count
          (PLT), Monocyte count (MONO) and Eosinophil count (EO) were determined as well as the
          Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte             ratio   (NEU/LYM)      and   the   systemic     immune-inflammation        index
          PLT*(NEU/LYM).            Moreover,       blood   biochemistry   parameters       such     as    Na+, K+   Aspartate
          aminotransferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Urea, C-Reactive Protein (CRP),
          Interleukin-6 (IL-6) as well as Procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), were assessed using
          Siemens ADVIA Centaur XP Immunoassay System.
          Data on coagulation parameters were obtained from all patients; coagulation tests included D-dimers,
          Fibrinogen (FIB) and international normalised ratio (INR). Tests were performed using a Sysmex CA-
          600 automatic coagulation analyser. Blood Gas Analysis (BGA) was performed on a Siemens
          rapidpoint 500®.

          Statistical analysis
          Categorical parameters were summarised as absolute numbers and percentages. Continuous data
          are shown as mean ± SD or median + Interquartile range (IQR).
          Continuous variables were evaluated using the D’Agostino & Pearson normality test – Independent
          data that follow the Gaussian distribution were analysed via the Student`s t-test, and non-Gaussian
          continuous variables were assessed via the Mann-Whitney test for independent comparisons.
          Comparisons of preoperative vs postoperative data were performed using a Paired T-test or Wilcoxon
          Signed Rank test for non-parametric data.
          The Fisher exact test was used to evaluate the association between categorical variables with the
          outcome. Regression and/or correlation analysis between the biomarkers over time were performed
          using Pearson’s or Spearman’s rank correlation testing.
          The data were analysed with the statistical programs Graphpad Prism (version 8.43) and Statsdirect
          (version 3.3.3)

          Treatment
          The general treatment protocol is shown in Figure 2 and follows practice safety recommendations,
          treatment strategies and up-to-date sepsis management guidelines [18-21]. The multidisciplinary
          care and therapeutic approach were previously described in detail by Ugurov et al. [15]
          Extracorporeal Blood Purification
          The Prismaflex® oXiris® system was mounted in the ICU and connected 4 - 12 hours after admission
          upon establishing control of the haemostasis, ACT = Activated Coagulation Time of 180 secs. The
          patient is connected to the Prismaflex® oXiris® system via a double lumen catheter placed in the
          femoral vein or vena subclavia.

          Results
          Patient demographics and clinical characteristics at admission
          Among the 61 patients admitted with COVID-19 in the selected period, 42 were treated with oXiris®
          and thus considered in this single-centre case series. Of these, 2 patients were readmitted and
          counted as independent cases, totalling 44 consecutive cases, Figure 1.
          The clinical characteristics and demographics are described in Table 1. At admission, 68.2% (N = 30)
          could be classified as severe, and 32.8% (N = 14) with mild to moderate symptoms (= non-severe).
          Primary symptoms reported were dyspnea, fever and breathing difficulties; all but one case (58/59,
          98.3%) had confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia at admission Supplemental Table 1 and 2.
          We have highlighted 3 unique and challenging cases in Figure 3.
          Patients with severe disease were characterised by more prolonged duration of symptoms; they were
          admitted on average 7 days (vs 5 days for non-severe cases, p=0.025 ) after symptom onset and
          were more likely to be referred from peripheral clinics (67% vs 36%, OR 3.6 [CI95% 0.98 to 13.3], p =
          0.101) in comparison to direct admission following self-isolation at home.
          We observed non-significant trends suggesting more pronounced respiratory difficulties and lower
          blood pressure in advanced disease. We aggregated selected laboratory values and patient signs that
          accounts for both acute and chronic disease to determine the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health
          Evaluation II (APACHE II) at admission; severe cases had an overall APACHE II score of 8.5 ± 4.6 vs
          4.7 ± 3.0, mean difference 3.5 [CI95% 3.5 to 6.1], p=0.011.
          Severe cases were admitted with a more prominent inflammatory profile, demonstrated by elevated
          levels of LDH, 494.5 U/L (IQR374 - 669); Ferritin, 1100 ng/mL (IQR406 - 1650); CRP, 151 mg/L
          (IQR82 - 211) and the immune indices NLR and SII, 11.5 (7.5 - 18.5) and 2580 (1554 - 4692),
          respectively. (Table 2). Moreover, we observed substantially higher D-dimers levels in severe cases
          compared to those with mild to moderate symptoms, median difference, 630 [CI95% 160.0 to 6220],
          p=0.013, (Table 2).
          Despite the clinically significant increase of two key acute phase proteins and inflammatory markers,
          there was only a marginal increase in IL-6 across the cohort, 15.5 (7.4 - 47.3) pg/mL
                                                                                                                                6

          Extracorporeal blood purification; treatment approach and clinical practice
          A total of 14 mild/moderate (56%) and 30 severe patients (88.8%) were suspected of
          hyperinflammation (= CRP ≥ 100 mg/L and/or IL-6 ≥ 40 pg/mL and/or Ferritin ≥ 500 ng/mL) and
          indicated for blood purification using the AN69ST (oXiris®) hemofilter in an attempt to control disease
          progression (Supplemental Figure 1).
          Flow rates were maintained as follow; effluent dose 35 mL/Kg/h, dialysate 14 – 16 mL/Kg/h, blood
          150 mL/min, replacement 16 -18 mL/Kg/h; patient fluid removal is tailored to the individual’s volume
          status, ≈ 100 - 250 mL/h. The oXiris® CRRT modality was chosen according to the patient’s kidney
          function; continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration
          (CVVHDF) or slow continuous ultrafiltration (SCUF).
          The average levels of urea, creatine and the Cockcroft Gault Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) were
          5.6 (3.9 - 8.1) mmol/L, 91.8 ± 32.2 µmol/L and 108.3 ± 39.7 mL/min, respectively. We observed 2
          cases of significant kidney dysfunction (= GFR < 50 mL/min) in our COVID-19 cohort.
          Consequently, CVVHF (42/44, 95.5%) was the predominant CRRT modality indicated with the
          primary aim to reduce inflammatory mediators. Alternatively, CVVHDF was used for renal support.
          Total run time on the Prismaflex system was 3303.8hr; on average severe cases were treated with 2
          (IQR1 - 3) blood purification cycles, one more than the non-severe patients. The average duration of
          blood purification was 30.3 hours (20.8 - 44.9) (Table 3).
          We observed no complications related to bleeding or thromboembolism. There were 9 occurrences of
          premature clotting (machine run time < 5hr) resulting in a linearised incidence premature clotting rate
          of 0.27% (patient-hours).
          One patient experienced a hematoma following venous cannulation that required a catheter
          displacement. Our complete treatment approach was previously documented [15]
          In parallel, during hospitalisation, 12 critical patients were treated with i.v. Dexamethasone at a dose
          of 8 mg q.d.

          4A), β = -23.0 [CI95% -36.79 to -9.251], p = 0.0012, vs β = -1.88 [CI95% -20.67 to 16.90], p = 0.841
          for the sub-group with milder symptoms).
          Likewise, EBP was associated with a decrease of CRP with treatment in non-severe cohort showing a
          significant time-dependent reduction β = -1.9 [CI95% -3.7 to -0.21], p = 0.03 (Fig 4B).
          Moreover, EBP was also characterized by a decrease of inflammatory immune indices NLR, β = -0.73
          [CI95% -1.31 to -0.15], p = 0.01 (Fig 4C) and SII, β = -72.3 [CI95% -30.2 to -6.0], p = 0.004, (Fig 4D).
          Neutrophilia (>75% neutrophils of total white blood cells) was a notable feature of our cohort (Table
          2), blood purification was associated with a significant decline in peripheral neutrophils (Fig 4E), and
          was also paired with the resolution of several cytopenias. Baseline levels of eosinophils, basophils,
          monocytes, lymphocytes in severe patients normalised during hospitalisation leading to increased
          numbers of WBC (Table 2 & Fig 4F-J).
          Non-severe cases had lower baseline thrombocyte counts, 138*103 counts/µL (IQR119 - 176)
          compared to severe patients, median difference -62*103 counts/µL [CI95% 13 to 142], p=0.012, which
          was normalised within a week (Fig 4K).
          We did not routinely perform screening for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific IgG antibodies at
          admission; nevertheless, the available data suggests that severe cases presented with higher
          baseline titers which further increased time (Fig 4L).
          Levels of LDH were discriminant at admission (Table 2), and the differences between subgroups
          persisted despite EBP (Fig 4M). Analysis of procalcitonin levels yielded similar observations (Table 2,
          Fig 4N).
          Hypercoagulability state was assessed via Fibrinogen and D-dimers; we noted a slight decrease in
          Fibrinogen levels over time in non-severe cases (Fig 4O). On the other hand, D-dimers remained
          significantly elevated despite hemofiltration (Fig 4P).
          IL-6 is the primary inducer of hepatic CRP synthesis and secretion; individual analysis indicates a
          periprocedural decrease of both IL-6 and CRP (Supplemental figure 1). Nonetheless, group
          analyses suggest that the time-dependent decrease in IL-6 was not significant (Fig 4Q).
                                                                                                                                8

          Paired analysis may explain the mixed response of IL-6 to blood purification; clinical recovery was
          associated with a decrease of IL-6 levels, median difference -21.44 pg/ml [CI95% -45.6 to -4.1],
          p=0.0001. Whereas IL-6 continued to rise in patients who ultimately succumbed to the disease
          despite repetitive hemofiltration cycles (Fig 4R); median difference 179.7 pg/ml [CI95% 42.02 to
          613.3], p=0.0009.
          Finally, haematological parameters showed a continuous declining trend (Figure 5). Liver enzymes
          remained stable during hospitalisation; however, whereas creatine remained within normal ranges,
          there was a rise of blood urea evident in the severe cohort (Fig 5F).
          Clinically, both subgroups were characterised by normalising vital parameters over time (Figure 6); in
          particular, severe patients experienced a gradual improvement in SpO2 and breathing capacity.
          Blood gas analyses (BGA) were comparable during the early phases of hospitalisation; excluding the
          individual exceptions, there were no notable differences in BGA parameters over time across the
          cohort.
          Severe cases requiring prolonged hospitalisation (> 2 weeks) showed possible signs of respiratory
          acidosis (ARDS) evidenced by decreasing pH-values and increasing levels of the partial pressure of
          carbon dioxide (pCO2) on mechanical circulatory support.
          We observed 19 cases (43.2%) (Table 3) of secondary bacterial co-infections, most confirmed
          microbiology cultures pertained to samples collected at admission; furthermore, positive microbiology
          was most likely to occur in patients admitted from peripheral clinics, OR 3.6 [CI95% 0.9 to 12.4],
          p=0.07. We most frequently detected Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and
          Enterobacteriaceae; however, we also detected Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii.
          The mortality rate over the whole cohort was 27%; the rate in severe cases was 44% vs 4% in non-
          severe, relative risk (RR) 7 [CI95%1.49 to 40.2], p=0.007.

          Discussion
          COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was
          identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an international public health emergency; with
          that, a multitude of therapeutic approaches have been pioneered to counter the detrimental clinical
          manifestations [22-25] linked to inflammatory immune disturbances
          We here describe the clinical course, outcome and longitudinal analysis of multiple biomarkers,
          clinical and blood gas parameters in non-severe vs severe COVID-19 patients treated with blood
          purification using the cytokine adsorbing oXiris® hemodiafilter.
          We and others have explored the use of cytokine blood purification in an attempt to prevent, control or
          reduce (suspected) hyperinflammation [26-30]. Several blood-purification devices are currently on the
          market, showing a significant reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and restore homeostatic
          dysregulation associated with systemic inflammatory syndromes [31-33].
          The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency approval to the oXiris®
          membrane filter and CytoSorb® column-based filter. Both devices have shown an exceptional
          capacity to reduce cytokine levels [32, 34], support hemodynamic stabilisation and increase survival
          probability, especially in patients whom therapy was initiated early [35, 36].
          We previously reported our preliminary results on EBP using the oXiris® filter in COVID-19 [15]. The
          cohort`s limited size precluded comparative analyses between patient subgroups stratified according
          to disease severity. With this follow up analysis on an expanded cohort we show that EBP was
          paired with longitudinal reduction of numerous inflammatory mediators, acute phase proteins and
          resolution of cytopenias (Figure 3).
          For instance, EBP was associated with a time-dependent decrease across the cohort in Ferritin,
          a well-described biomarker associated with severe COVID-19 [37, 38]. Interestingly, oXiris® was
          associated with significant decreases over time of CRP in non-severe cases but not in severe
          cases.
          Moreover, our results suggest a weaker association between IL-6 and CRP in COVID-19 patients
          treated with EBP; the two markers showed a weak(er) correlation (r = 0.05, p = 0.66, non-severe and
                                                                                                                              10

          r, = 0.35, p<0.001 severe cases (Supplemental Figure 2). IL-6 is the main stimulus for CRP
          synthesis and others have described a strong positive correlation between IL-6 and CRP in numerous
          disease conditions [39-41].
          Systemic levels of CRP were more detected in critical ranges compared to IL-6. The cytokine was
          increased in severe cases, but overall, the systemic levels detected were lower than observed in our
          historical bacterial sepsis cohort.
          The higher levels of CRP irrespective of IL-6 might be explained as follows: IL-6 is the primary driver
          of increased production of CRP; however, during injury or other trauma, other pro-inflammatory
          cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-α and IL-8 may contribute the production of CRP [42-44].
          Current literature indicates that although IL-6 is essential for CRP gene induction, it is not sufficient to
          achieve this alone [45] and might require orchestrated stimuli by multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines
          to boost CRP gene expression. Collectively, the increased levels of IL-1, TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-6 seen
          in COVID-19 plausibly synergise to enhance CRP gene expression [46].
          Recently, three studies have compared cytokine levels in COVID-19 to other conditions [46-48] and
          hinted that the term “cytokine storm” is perhaps not applicable to COVID-19 as was previously
          postulated.
          Possibly a case of semantics; the immunological disturbances in COVID-19 encompass both innate
          and adaptive arms [46, 4, 49] and clinically possess many hallmarks of cytokine storm syndrome [50,
          51].
          In our experience, abnormal neutrophil counts and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (NLR)
          often accompanied hyperinflammation. Neutrophilia was shown to coincide with lung lesion injury on
          CT [52] and predict poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients [8]. The NLR is also an independent risk
          factor for adverse outcome [53, 52]. Our results point to higher NLR in severe patients and EBP was
          associated with normalizing neutrophil counts and NLR.
          Along similar lines, LDH is strongly linked with disease severity; elevated LDH serum concentrations
          reflect tissue/cell destruction and are regarded as a common sign of tissue/cell damage [54]. Serum
          LDH has been identified as an important biomarker for the activity and severity of idiopathic
          pulmonary fibrosis [55].
          For critically ill patients with COVID-19, the rise in LDH level may indicate an increase of the activity
          and extent of lung injury. To this end, LDH has emerged as a prominent variable to distinguish the
                                                                                                                              11

          majority of COVID-19 patients who require immediate medical attention [56]. In our study, the patients
          that succumbed to COVID-19 all showed repetitive measurements of LDH surpassing the critical
          threshold of 365 U/L linked to mortality [56].
          The incidence of bacterial co-infection (43%) was higher than previously reported [57-59]. In
          compliance with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) guidelines [60, 61], we collect nasopharyngeal
          samples and also perform hemocultures in critical COVID-19 cases at admission. We detected
          bacterial co-infections more frequently in patients previously hospitalised at peripheral clinics
          compared to the sub-group admitted from home.
          Empirical antibiotics are administered for max 48hr or discontinued immediately following negative
          representative cultures [62]. It is possible that our AMR-protocol may be masked by unwarranted
          antibiotics administration elsewhere, a common clinical practice in south-eastern Europe [63-66].
          Clinically, the heterogeneity among the severe cases was striking; the clinical course of severe
          COVID-19, the extent of the affected lung area and development of ARDS was often not aligned with
          systemic levels of biomarkers. Several critical cases in need of mechanical ventilation and inotrope
          support showed clinical deterioration despite decreasing inflammatory mediators.
          A consistent observation in our study was the gradual decrease in SpO2 in critical cases and the
          continuous high values of D-dimers, which may point to hypercoagulability, micro-embolism, leading
          to inadequate peripheral oxygen homeostasis.
          Interestingly, we observed just two cases of AKI during the study period; a surprising finding given
          that the pooled incidence rate of 8.9% (CI95% 4.6 - 14.5) reported by Chen et al. [67]
          Finally, the observed mortality rate of 27% observed in this case series is comparable to what has
          been recently reported [68].
          Limitations
          Because of the observational design, absence of randomisation and limited cohort size are unable to
          provide concrete clinical guidance on the optimal EBP strategy to control disease progression and
          prevent ARDS. Nevertheless, with 3000+ accumulated hours of EBP run-time and real-time data on
          44 patients we collected sufficient datapoints to establish biomarker fluctuations over time and
          evaluate the safety-profile of oXiris® blood purification.

          Conclusion
          Our study results indicate that extracorporeal blood purification with oXiris® was associated with
          reduced levels of acute-phase proteins, resolution of cytopenias and control of hyperinflammation.
          EBP represents an attractive treatment modality to limit systemic damage caused by aberrant
          immune activation and therefore may stabilise the clinical condition of COVID-19 patients.

          Figure 2 - Treatment protocol for COVID-19 patients
          In addition to blood purification, systemic heparinisation and physical therapy under continuous
          positive airway pressure (CPAP), the general care protocol consisted of rest and recovery; sufficient
          caloric intake and adequate electrolyte balance; aggressive rehydration in the first 24 hours;
          parenteral, enteral nutrition for mechanically ventilated patients; low-dose Dexamethasone therapy (8
          mg/24 hours), antibiotic therapy, and biochemical and chest X-ray imaging for monitoring
          Figure 3 – Radiography timeline and clinical course description of 3 COVID-19 cases treated
          with hemofiltration
          Upper panels, a 71-year-old woman was admitted to our ICU with breathing difficulties for five days.
          Her peripheral oxygen saturation was 75% without oxygen support, and chest X-ray revealed diffuse
          atypical pneumonia (A). The laboratory findings showed suggested hyperinflammation and
          hypercoagulability, CRP, Fibrinogen, D-dimers and Ferritin of 208.9 mg/L, 5.5 g/L, 12980 ng/mL and
          1198.4 ng/mL, respectively.
          Treatment with non-invasive ventilation was started and prone positioning. Continuous venovenous
          hemofiltration (CVVHF) using oXiris® filter was initiated in parallel.
          After two cycles of hemofiltration, the biochemical picture improved. The respiratory condition of the
          patient also improved (B). On day eight, after admission, the third cycle of hemofiltration was
          performed because of fever (38.3%) and a de novo increase of inflammatory markers. Afterwards, the
          patient recovered well and was discharged on day 18th after admission with 1-2L O2 support SpO2
          91-93% and improvements on the lung pictures (C). The clinical improvement of this patient was also
          associated with remarkable normalisation of eosinopenia, from 0.14% at admission to 5.6% at
          discharge.
          Middle panels, a 64-year-old man, was admitted to our ICU from home with fever (38.4°C), fatigue
          and cough. He was diagnosed COVID-19 three days earlier. Chest X-ray (D) showed bilateral atypical
          inflammation, and the laboratory findings showed high levels of inflammatory markers during our care
                                                                                                                              24

          (peak levels of CRP, IL-6, Ferritin, LDH, Fibrinogen and D-dimers were 177.9 mg/L, 142 pg/mL, 1347
          ng/mL, 586 U/L, 8 g/L and 7791 ng/mL, respectively. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration using
          oXiris® filter was initiated within 8 hours after admission and performed a total of 5x cycles. On day
          five after admission, the patient required oxygen support (SpO2 89%, 4L O2).
          The patient was treated with non-invasive ventilation and was placed in a prone position. Chest X-ray
          showed significant bilateral progression of inflammation in the lungs, in particular on the left lobe (E).
          Because of repeating episodes of fever (Procalcitonin 0.21 ng/mL), a broad-spectrum antibiotic was
          started to counter a possible superinfection. The patient underwent five cycles of continuous
          venovenous hemofiltration using oXiris® filter. On day 14 after admission, the patient required no
          oxygen support; his clinical condition was gradually improving, and we were able to discharge the
          patient after 21 days; radiography pointed to residual lung injury and signs of fibrosis (F). Follow up
          after 30 days pointed to further improvement according to biomarkers (Fibrinogen 8.0 g/L vs 5.5 g/L at
          discharge, D-dimers, 1930 ng/mL vs 6250 ng/mL at discharge and LDH 173 U/L vs 586 U/L.
          However, he reported signs of cardiovascular disease (NYHA III); the patient will remain under
          continuous monitoring.
          Lower panels, 57-year-old women were transferred to our ICU from another peripheral hospital
          because of worsening of oxygen saturation (SpO2 75%, 6-8 L O2, respiratory rate 35/min). Chest X-
          ray showed bilateral atypical inflammation (G). Diagnosis via radiography and RT-PCR was
          accompanied by high levels of Lactate Dehydrogenase (453 U/L), C-reactive protein (299.5 mg/L) and
          Neutrophilia (90.2%). CVVHF using Oxiris filter (Prismaflex, Gambro). In total, three cycles were
          performed with a duration period of 24 hours per cycle. Simultaneously the patient was treated with
          non-invasive ventilation and was placed on prone position. The sputum culture showed Escherichia
          coli and Candida species. Escherichia coli was treated with Ceftriaxone and Candida species with
          fluconazole. On day seven after admission, the patient had 93% SpO2 saturation with nasal flow
          cannula 2l/min (H). The patient was discharged on day 11 with no need for oxygen support but with
          significant lung fibrosis (I).
