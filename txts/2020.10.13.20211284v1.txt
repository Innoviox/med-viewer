     18      Abstract:
     19      Background: Countries with strict lockdown had a spike on the number of deaths. A recent
     20      mathematical model has suggested that staying at home did not play a dominant role in reducing
     21      COVID-19 transmission. Comparison between number of deaths and social mobility is difficult
     22      due to the non-stationary nature of the COVID-19 data.
     23      Objective: To propose a novel approach to assess the association between staying at home
     24      values and the reduction/increase in the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in several regions
     25      around the world.
     26      Methods: In this ecological study, data from www.google.com/covid19/mobility/,
     27      ourworldindata.org and covid.saude.gov.br were combined. Countries with >100 deaths and with
     28      a Healthcare Access and Quality Index of ≥67 were included. Data were preprocessed and
     29      analyzed using the difference between number of deaths/million between 2 regions and the
     30      difference between the percentage of staying at home. Analysis was performed using linear
     31      regression and residual analysis
     32      Results: After preprocessing the data, 87 regions around the world were included, yielding 3,741
     33      pairwise comparisons for linear regression analysis. Only 63 (1.6%) comparisons were
     34      significant.
     35      Discussion: With our results, we were not able to explain if COVID-19 mortality is reduced by
     36      staying as home in ~98% of the comparisons after epidemiological weeks 9 to 34.

     38      Introduction
     39      By late September, 2020, approximately one million people worldwide had died from the new
     40      coronavirus (COVID-19) (Coronavirus Update (Live): 13,578,330 Cases and 583,696 Deaths
     41      from COVID-19 Virus Pandemic - Worldometer). Wearing masks, taking personal precautions,
     42      testing for COVID-19 and social distancing have been advocated for controlling the pandemic
     43      (Huang and Chen 2020; Lin et al. 2020; Wu and Qi 2020). To achieve source control and stop
     44      transmission, social distancing has been interpreted by many as staying at home. Such policies
     45      across multiple jurisdictions were suggested by some experts (Guest et al. 2020). These measures
     46      were supported by the World Health Organization (WHO Director-General’s opening remarks at
     47      the media briefing on COVID-19 - 13 April 2020), local authorities (Ministry of Housing,
     48      Communities and Local Government 2020; Mucientes and Carrasco 2020; Governor Cuomo
     49      Signs the “New York State on PAUSE” Executive Order 2020), and encouraged on social media
     50      platforms (Criativo; A Movement to Stop the COVID-19 Pandemic | #StayTheFuckHome,
     51      #[stayathome] (Brazilian twitter)).
     52      Some mathematical models and meta-analyses have shown a marked reduction in COVID-19
     53      cases (Ambikapathy and Krishnamurthy 2020; Espinoza et al. 2020; Ibarra-Vega 2020; Liu et al.
     54      2020; Nussbaumer-Streit et al. 2020; Sjödin et al. 2020) and deaths (Ferguson et al. 2020;
     55      Semenova et al. 2020) associated with lockdown policies. Brazilian researchers have published
     56      mathematical models of spreading patterns (Peixoto et al. 2020) and suggested implementing
     57      social distancing measures and protection policies to control virus transmission (Aquino et al.
     58      2020). By May 5th, 2020, an early report, using number of curfew days in 49 countries, found
     59      evidence that lockdown could be used to suppress the spread of COVID-19 (Atalan 2020).
     60      Measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic with Non-Pharmacological Interventions (NPIs)
     61      were adopted after Brazil enacted Law No. 13979 (Imprensa Nacional), and this was followed by
     62      many states such as Rio de Janeiro (Decreto 46970 27/03/2020), the Federal District of Brasília
     63      (Decree No. 40520, dated March 14th, 2020) (Decreto 40520 de 14/03/2020), the city of São
     64      Paulo (Decree No. 59.283, dated March 16th, 2020) (Decreto 59283 2020 de São Paulo SP), and
     65      the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Decree No. 55240/2020, dated May 10th, 2020) (Decreto 55240
     66      de 10/05/2020). It was expected that, with these actions, the number of deaths by COVID-19
     67      would be reduced. Of note, the country’s most populous state, São Paulo, adopted rigorous
     68      quarantine measures and put them into effect on March 24th, 2020 (Decreto 59283 2020 de São
     69      Paulo SP). Internationally, Peru adopted the world's strictest lockdown (Tegel 2020).
     70      Recently, Google LLC published datasets indicating changes in mobility (compared to an
     71      average baseline before the COVID-19 pandemic). These reports were created with aggregated,
     72      anonymized sets of daily and dynamic data at country and sub-regional levels drawn from users
     73      who had enabled the Location History setting on their cell phones. These data reflect real-world
     74      changes in social behavior and provide information on mobility trends for places like grocery
     75      stores, pharmacies, parks, public transit stations, retail and recreation locations, residences, and
     76      workplaces, when compared to the baseline period prior to the pandemic (Google LLC).
     77      Mobility in places of residence provides information about the "time spent in residences", which
     78      we will hereafter call “staying at home” and use as a surrogate for measuring adherence to stay-
     79      at-home policies.
     80      Studies using Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports and the daily number of new
     81      COVID-19 cases have shown that over 7 weeks a strong correlation between staying at home
     82      and the reduction of COVID-19 cases in 20 counties in the United States (Badr et al. 2020);
     83      COVID-19 cases decreased by 49% after 2 weeks of staying at home (Banerjee and Nayak

     84      2020); the incidence of new cases/100,000 people was also reduced (Wang et al. 2020); social
     85      distancing policies were associated with reduction in COVID-19 spread in the US (Gao et al.
     86      2020); as well as in 49 countries around the world (Atalan 2020). A recent report using Brazilian
     87      and European data has shown a correlation between NPI stringency and the spread of COVID-19
     88      (Candido et al. 2020; Islam et al. 2020); these analyses are debatable, however, due to their short
     89      time span and the type of time series behavior (Bernal et al. 2017), or for their use of Pearson’s
     90      correlation in the context of non-stationary time series (Gao et al. 2020). For instance, applying
     91      the same statistical analysis to stationary and non-stationary time series is not sufficient for
     92      statistical analysis (Nason 2006), and the latter is the case with this COVID-19 data. A 2020
     93      Cochrane systematic review of this topic reported that they were not completely certain about
     94      this evidence for several reasons. The COVID-19 studies based their models on limited data and
     95      made different assumptions about the virus (Nussbaumer-Streit et al. 2020); the stay-at-home
     96      variable was analyzed as a binary indicator (Sen et al. 2020); and the number of new cases could
     97      have been substantially undocumented (Li et al. 2020); all which may have biased the results. A
     98      sophisticated mathematical model based on a high-dimensional system of partial differential
     99      equations to represent disease spread has been proposed (Zamir et al. 2020). According to this
    100      model, staying at home did not play a dominant role in disease transmission, but the combination
    101      of these, together with the use of face masks, hand washing, early-case detection (PCR test), and
    102      the use of hand sanitizers for at least 50 days could have reduced the number of new cases.
    103      Finally, after 2 months, the simulations that drove the world to lockdown have been questioned
    104      (Boretti 2020).
    105      After more than 25 epidemiological weeks of this pandemic, verifying if staying at home had an
    106      impact on mortality rates is of particular interest. A PUBMED search with the terms “COVID-
    107      19” AND (Mobility) (search made on September 8th, 2020) yielded 246 articles; of these, 35
    108      were relevant to mobility measures and COVID-19, but none compared mobility reduction to
    109      mortality rates.
    110      We are looking for the association between two variables: deaths/million and the percentage of
    111      people who remained in their residences. Comparison, however, is difficult due to the non-
    112      stationary nature of the data. To overcome this problem, we proposed a novel approach to assess
    113      the association between staying at home values and the reduction/increase in the number of
    114      deaths due to COVID-19 in several regions around the world. If the variation in the difference
    115      between the number of deaths/million in two countries, say A and B, and the variation in the
    116      difference of the staying at home values between A and B present similar patterns, this is due to
    117      an association between the two variables. In contrast, if these patterns are very different, this is
    118      evidence that staying at home values and the number of deaths/million are not related (unless, of
    119      course, other unaccounted for factors are at play).

    125      Setting - Data collection on mobility
    126      Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports provided data on mobility from 138 countries
    127      and regions (Coronavirus Source Data 2020, Coronavírus Brasil) between February 15th and
    128      August 21st, 2020.(Google LLC) Data regarding the average times spent at home was generated

    129      in comparison to the baseline. Baseline was considered to be the median value from between
    130      January 3rd and February 6th, 2020. Data obtained between February 15th and August 21th 2020
    131      was divided into epidemiological weeks (epi-weeks) and the mean percentage of time spent
    132      staying at home per week was obtained.
    133      Data collection on mortality
    134      Numbers of daily deaths from selected regions were obtained from open databases (Coronavirus
    135      Source Data 2020, Coronavírus Brasil) on August 27st, 2020.
    136      Inclusion criteria for analysis
    137      Only regions with mobility data and with more than 100 deaths, by August 26th, 2020, were
    138      included in this study. For data quality, only countries with Healthcare Access and Quality
    139      Index (HAQI) of ≥ 67 were included.(Barber et al. 2017) By choosing a HAQI of ≥ 67, we
    140      assumed that data from these countries were reliable and healthcare was of high quality. For
    141      Brazilian regions, a HAQI was substituted for the Human Development Index (HDI), and those
    142      with <0.549 (low) were excluded.
    143      Three major cities with >100 deaths and well-established results (Tokyo, Japan; Berlin,
    144      Germany, and New York, USA) were selected as controlled areas.
    145      Dataset of COVID-19 cases and associated data
    146      After inclusion of the countries/regions, further data were obtained to reduce comparison bias,
    147      including population density (population/km²), percentage of the urban population, HDI, and the
    148      total area of the region in square kilometers. All data were obtained from open databases.(2019
    149      Human Development Index Ranking, [Cities and States Statistics], Population by Country (2020)
    150      - Worldometer)
    151      Classification of areas with COVID-19
    152      Regions were classified as controlled for cases of COVID-19 if they present at least two out of
    153      the three following conditions: a) type of transmission classified as “clusters of cases”, b) a
    154      downward curve of newly reported deaths in the last seven days, and c) a flat curve in the
    155      cumulative total number of deaths in the last seven days (variation of 5%) according to the
    156      World Health Organization.(WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard) An example is
    157      shown in Figure S3 (supplement).
    158      Data from the cities (Tokyo, Berlin, New York, Fortaleza, Belo Horizonte, Manaus, Rio de
    159      Janeiro, São Paulo, and Porto Alegre) were obtained from official government sites.(Population
    160      of Tokyo - Tokyo Metropolitan Government, Berlin, COVID-19:Data, Planning-Population-
    161      Census 2010-DCP) Tokyo, Berlin and New York were chosen for having controlled the COVID-
    162      19 dissemination, for representing three different continents, and for similarity to major Brazilian
    163      cities (Fortaleza, Belo Horizonte, Manaus, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Porto Alegre).
    164      Merged database
    165      Different databases from the sites mentioned above were merged using Microsoft Excel Power
    166      Query (Microsoft Office 2010 for Windows Version 14.0.7232.5000) and manually inspected for
    167      consistency.
    168      Processing the data - cleaning
    169      Data collected from multiple regions were processed using Python 3.7.3 in the Jupyter Notebook
    170      environment through the use of the Python Data Analysis Library in Google Colab Research.

    171      Details of preprocessing are described in Python script (Supplemental material). Briefly, after
    172      taking the sum of deaths/million per epi-week, and the average of the variable “staying at home”
    173      per epi-week, non-stationary patterns were mitigated by subtracting weekt by weekt-1.
    174      Time series data setup and variables
    175      Details regarding the pre-processing and methodological details were presented on the approach
    176      for analyzing the time series data. Our variables were the difference in the variation of deaths
    177      between locations A and B (dependent variable - outcome), and the difference in the variation of
    178      staying at home values between the same location (independent variable).
    179      Comparison between areas
    180      Direct comparison, between regions with and without controlled COVID-19 cases, was
    181      considered in two scenarios: 1) Restrictive if, at least three out of four of the following
    182      conditions were similar: a) population density, b) percentage of the urban population, c) HDI and
    183      d) total area of the region. Similarity was considered adequate when a variation in conditions a),
    184      b), and c) was within 30%, while, for condition d), a variation of 50% was considered adequate.
    185      2) Global: all regions and countries were compared to each other.
    186      Statistical analysis
    187      Rationale
    188      Time series on COVID-19 mortality (deaths/millions) display a non-stationary pattern. The daily
    189      data present a very distinct seasonal behavior on the weekends, with valleys on Saturdays and
    190      Sundays followed by peaks on Mondays (Figure S1)
    191      To make it stationary, one may introduce dummy variables for Saturdays, Sundays, and
    192      Mondays, regress the number of deaths in these dummy variables, and then analyze the residuals.
    193      However, in most cases, the residuals are still non-stationary time series, and special treatment
    194      would be required in each case. Although this approach may be feasible for a few series, we are
    195      interested in analyzing hundreds of time series from different countries and regions. Hence, we
    196      need a more efficient way to deal with this amount of data. The covariates present another issue
    197      in regressing the daily time series of deaths/staying at home. The covariates are typically
    198      correlated with error terms due to public policies adopted by regions/countries. Mechanisms
    199      controlling social isolation are intrinsically related to the number of deaths/cases in each
    200      location. An increase in the death rate may cause more stringent policies to be adopted, which
    201      increases the percentage of people staying at home. This change causes an imbalance between
    202      the observed number of deaths and staying at home levels. In a regression model, this
    203      discrepancy is accounted for in the error term. Hence, the error term will change in accordance
    204      with staying at home levels.
    205      Approach for analyzing the time series data
    206      Data aggregation by epidemiological week is a plausible alternative (Figure S2). In this way,
    207      artificial seasonality, imposed by work scheduled during weekends and the effect of
    208      governmental control over social interaction, in a regression framework, are mitigated. The
    209      drawback is that the sample size is significantly reduced from 187 days (Figure S1) to 26
    210      epidemiological weeks (Figure S2).
    211      Aggregation by epidemiological week, however, still yields non-stationary time series in most
    212      cases. To overcome this problem, we differentiated each time series. Recall that if ௧ denotes the
    213      number of deaths in the -th epidemiological week, we define the first difference of ௧ as

    214                                                               ௧   ௧    ௧ିଵ  .
    215      Intuitively,  ௧ denotes the variation of deaths between weeks  and t-1 , also known as the flux
    216      of deaths. The same is valid for the staying at home time series. This simple operation yielded, in
    217      most cases, stationary time series, and verified with the so-called Phillips-Perron stationarity test
    218      (Perron 1988). In the few cases where the resulting time series did not reject the null hypothesis
    219      of non-stationarity (technically, the existence of a unitary root, in the time series characteristic),
    220      this was due to the presence of one or two outliers combined with the small sample size. These
    221      outliers were usually related to the very low incidence of COVID-19 deaths by the 9th
    222      epidemiological week when paired with countries with a significant number of deaths in that
    223      same week, thus resulting in an outlier which cannot be accounted for by linear
    224      regression.(Perron 1988)
    225      To investigate pairwise behavior, we propose a method to assess the relationship between deaths
    226      and staying at home data between various countries and regions. For two countries/regions, say
    227      A and B, let ௧ ஺ and ௧ ஻ denote the number of deaths per million at epidemiological week  for
    228      country A and B respectively, while ௧ ஺ and ௧ ஻ denote the staying at home at epidemiological
    229      week  for A and B, respectively. The idea is to regress the difference ௧஺  ௧஻   ௧஺ 
    230      ௧஻ on ௧஺  ௧஻   ௧஺  ௧஻ . Formally, we perform the regression
                                                    ௧஺  ௧஻          ଴     ଵ  ௧஺  ௧஻          ௧ ,
    231      where ଴ and ଵ are unknown coefficients and ௧ denotes an error term. Estimation of ଴ and ଵ is
    232      carried out through ordinary least squares. The interpretation of the model is important. We are
    233      regressing the difference in the variation of deaths between locations A and B into the difference
    234      in the variation of staying at home values between the same location.
    235      If the number of deaths in locations A and B have a similar functional behavior over time, then
    236      ௧஺  ௧஻ tends to be near-constant, and  ௧஺  ௧஻ tends to oscillate around zero. If the same
    237      applies to  ௧஺  ௧஻ , then we expect ଵ  0; consequently, we conclude that the behavior,
    238      between A and B, is similar and the number of deaths and the percentage of staying at home are
    239      associated in these regions. The other non-spurious situation implying ଵ  0occurs when the
    240      variation in the number of deaths in locations A and B increases/decreases over time following a
    241      certain pattern, while the variation in the percentage of “staying at home” values also
    242      increases/decreases following the same pattern (apart from the direction). In this situation, we
    243      found different epidemiological patterns as in the variation in the number of deaths, and in the
    244      staying at home values, in locations A and B were on opposite trends. However, if these patterns
    245      were similar (proportional), this would be captured in the difference and, as a consequence, in
    246      the regression. This means that the different trends were near proportional and, hence, the
    247      variation in staying at home is associated with the variation in deaths.
    248      The proposed approach presents a way to evaluate staying at home and the number of deaths
    249      between two countries/regions. In the section below “Definition of areas with and without
    250      controlled cases of COVID-19”, each country/region was classified into a binary class: either
    251      controlled or not controlled areas for COVID-19. The proposed method allows for insights
    252      regarding the association of the number of deaths and staying at home levels between
    253      countries/regions with similar/different degrees of COVID-19 control.
    254      Estimation of ଴ and ଵ is carried out through ordinary least squares. Assumptions related to
    255      consistency, efficiency, and asymptotic normality of the ordinary least squares, in the context of
    256      time series regression, can be found in Greene, 2012 (Greene 2012). Since we are comparing
    257      many time series, to avoid any problem with spurious regression, we performed a cointegration

    258      test between the response and covariates. In this context, this is equivalent to testing the
    259      stationarity of ௧ , which was done by performing the Phillips-Perron test. Residual analysis is of
    260      utmost importance in linear regression, especially in the context of small samples. The steps and
    261      tests performed in the residual analysis are described in the statistical analysis section.
    262      After data preprocessing, the association between the number of deaths and staying at home was
    263      verified using a linear regression approach. Data were analyzed using the Python model
    264      statsmodels.api v0.12.0 (statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS; statsmodels.org), and
    265      double-checked using R version 3.6.1. False Discovery Rate proposed by Benjamini-Hochberg
    266      (FDR-BH) was used for multiple testing.
    267      We checked the residuals for heteroskedasticity using White’s test; for the presence of
    268      autocorrelation using the Lagrange Multiplier test; for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk’s
    269      normality test; and for functional specification using the Ramsey’s RESET test. All tests were
    270      performed with a 0.05 significance level and the analysis was performed with R version 3.6.1.
    271      Data from 30 restrictive comparisons were manually inspected and checked a third time using
    272      Microsoft Excel (Microsoft). A heat map was designed using GraphPad Prism version 8.4.3 for
    273      Mac (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA). Graphs plotting the number of
    274      deaths/million and staying at home over epidemiological weeks were obtained from Google
    275      Sheets.
    276      Results
    277      A flowchart of the data manipulation is depicted in Figure 1. Briefly, Google COVID-19
    278      Community Mobility Report data between February 16th and August 21st, 2020, yielded 138
    279      separate countries and their regions. The website Our World in Data provided data on 212
    280      countries (between December 31st, 2019, and August 26th, 2020), and the Brazilian Health
    281      Ministry website provided data on all states (n=27) and cities (n=5,570) in Brazil (February 25th
    282      to August 26th, 2020).
    283      After data compilation, a total of 87 regions and countries were selected: 51 countries, 27 States
    284      in Brazil, six major Brazilian State capitals [Manaus, Amazonas (AM), Fortaleza, Ceará (CE),
    285      Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais (MG), Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro (RJ), São Paulo, São Paulo
    286      (SP) and Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul (RS)], and three major cities throughout the world
    287      (Tokyo, Berlin and New York) (Figure 1).
    288      Characteristics of these 87 regions are presented in Table 1 (further details are in Supplemental
    289      Material - Characteristics of Regions).
    290
    291      Comparisons
    292      The restrictive analysis between controlled and not controlled areas yielded 33 appropriate
    293      comparisons, as shown in Table 2. Only one comparison out of 33 (3%) - state of Roraima
    294      (Brazil) versus state of Rondonia (Brazil) - was significant (p-value = 0.04). After correction for
    295      residual analysis, it did not pass the autocorrelation test (Lagrange Multiplier test=0.04). (Further
    296      details are in Supplemental Material - Restrictive Analysis).
    297      The global comparison yielded 3,741 combinations; from these, 184 (4.9%) had a p-value <
    298      0.05, after correcting for False Discovery Rate (Table S3). After performing the residual
    299      analysis, by testing for cointegration between response and covariate, normality of the residuals,
    300      presence of residual autocorrelation, homoscedasticity, and functional specification, only 63
    301      (1.6%) of models passed all tests (Table S4). Closer inspection of several cases where the model

    302      did not pass all the tests revealed a common factor: the presence of outliers, mostly due to
    303      differences in the epidemiological week in which deaths started to be reported. A heat map
    304      showing the comparison between the 87 regions is presented in Figure 2.
    305      Discussion
    306      We were not able to explain the variation of deaths/million in different regions in the world by
    307      social isolation, herein analyzed as differences in staying at home, compared to baseline. In the
    308      restrictive and global comparisons, only 3% and 1.6% of the comparisons were significantly
    309      different, respectively. These findings are in accordance with those found by Klein et al. (Klein
    310      et al.). These authors explain why lockdown was the least probable cause for Sweden's high
    311      death rate from COVID-19 (Klein et al.). Likewise, Chaudry et al. made a country-level
    312      exploratory analysis, using a variety of socioeconomic and health-related characteristics, similar
    313      to what we have done here, and reported that full lockdowns and wide-spread testing were not
    314      associated with COVID-19 mortality per million people (Chaudhry et al. 2020). Different from
    315      Chaudry et al., in our dataset, after 25 epidemiological weeks, (counting from the 9th
    316      epidemiological week onwards in 2020) we included regions and countries with a "plateau" and
    317      a downslope phase in their epidemiological curves. Our findings are in accordance with the
    318      dataset of daily confirmed COVID-19 deaths/million in the UK. Pubs, restaurants, and
    319      barbershops were open in Ireland on June 29th and masks were not mandatory (Therese 2020);
    320      after more than 2 months, no spike was observed; indeed, death rates kept falling (Daily
    321      confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million, rolling 7-day average). Peru has been considered to be
    322      the most strict lockdown country in the world (Tegel 2020), nevertheless, by September 20th, it
    323      had the highest number of deaths/million (Coronavirus Update (Live): 31,036,957 Cases and
    324      962,339 Deaths from COVID-19 Virus Pandemic - Worldometer). Of note, differences were
    325      also observed between regions that were considered to be COVID-19 controlled, e.g., Sweden
    326      versus Macedonia. Possible explanations for these significant differences may be related to the
    327      magnitude of deaths in these countries.
    328      Our results are different from those published by Flaxman et al. These authors calculated that
    329      NPIs would prevent 3.1 million deaths across 11 European countries (Flaxman et al. 2020). The
    330      discrepant results can be explained by different approaches to the data. While Flaxman et al.
    331      assumed a constant reproduction number (Rt) to calculate the total number of deaths, which
    332      eventually did not occur, we calculated the difference between the actual number of deaths
    333      between 2 countries/regions. The same explanation for the discrepancy can be applied to other
    334      publications where mathematical models were created to predict outcomes (Ambikapathy and
    335      Krishnamurthy 2020; Ibarra-Vega 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Nussbaumer-Streit et al. 2020; Sjödin et
    336      al. 2020). Most of these studies dealt with COVID-19 cases (Banerjee and Nayak 2020; Wang et
    337      al. 2020) and not observed deaths. Despite its limitations, reported deaths are likely to be more
    338      reliable than new case data. Further explanations for different results in the literature, besides
    339      methodological aspects, could be explained by the complexity of the virus dynamic and its
    340      interaction with the environment. It is unwise to try to explain a complex and multifactorial
    341      condition, with the inherent constant changes, using a single variable. An initial approach would
    342      employ a linear regression to verify the influence of one factor over an outcome. Herein we were
    343      not able to identify this association.
    344      This study has limitations. Different from the established paradigm of randomized clinical trial,
    345      this is an ecological study. An ecological study observes findings at the population level and
    346      generates hypotheses (Pearce 2000). Population-level studies play an essential part in defining
    347      the most important public health problems to be tackled (Pearce 2000), which is the case here.

    348      Another limitation was the use of Google Community Mobility Reports as a surrogate marker for
    349      staying at home. This may underestimate the real value: for instance, if a user´s cell phone is
    350      switched off while at home, the observation will be absent from the database. Furthermore, the
    351      sample does not represent 100% of the population. This tool, nevertheless, has been used by
    352      other authors to demonstrate the efficacy in reducing the number of new cases after NPI (Delen
    353      et al. 2020; Vokó and Pitter 2020). Using different methodologies for measuring mobility may
    354      introduce bias and would prevent comparisons between different countries. The number of
    355      deaths may be another issue. Death figures may be underestimated, however, reported deaths
    356      may be more relevant than new case data. The arbitrary criteria used for including countries and
    357      regions, the restrictive comparisons, and our definition of an area as COVID-19 controlled are
    358      open for criticism. Nonetheless, these arbitrary criteria were created a priori to the selection of
    359      the countries. With these criteria, we expected to obtain representative regions of the world,
    360      compare similar regions, and obtain accurate data. By using a HAQI of ≥ 67, we assumed that
    361      data from these countries would be accurate, reliable, and health conditions were generally good.
    362      Nevertheless, the global analysis of the regions (  3741 comparisons) overcame any issue of
    363      the restrictive comparison. Indeed, the global comparison confirmed the results found in the
    364      restrictive one; only 1.6% of the death rates could be explained by staying at home. Also, our
    365      effective sample size in all studies is only 25 epidemiological weeks, which is a very small
    366      sample size for a time series regression. The small sample size and the non-stationary nature of
    367      COVID-19 data are challenges for statistical models, but our analysis, with 25 epidemiological
    368      weeks, is relatively larger than previous publications which used only 7 weeks (Ghosal et al.
    369      2020). The effects of small samples in this case are related to possible large type II errors and
    370      also affect the consistency of the ordinary least square estimates. Nevertheless, given the
    371      importance of social isolation promoted by world authorities (COVID-19 advice - Physical
    372      distancing), we expected a higher incidence of significant comparisons, even though it could be
    373      an ecological fallacy. The low number of significant associations between regions for mortality
    374      rate and the percentage of staying at home may be a case of exception fallacy, which is a
    375      generalization of individual characteristics applied at the group-level characteristics (Miller and
    376      Brewer 2003).
    377      There are strengths to highlight. Inclusion criteria and the Healthcare Access and Quality Index
    378      were incorporated. We obtained representative regions throughout the world, including major
    379      cities from 4 different continents. Special attention was given to compiling and analyzing the
    380      dataset. We also devised a tailored approach to deal with challenges presented by the data. To
    381      our knowledge, our modeling approach is unique in pooling information from multiple countries
    382      all at once using up-to-date data. Some criteria, such as population density, percentage of urban
    383      population, HDI, and HAQI, were established to compare similar regions. Finally, we gave
    384      special attention to the residual analysis in the linear regression, an absolutely essential aspect of
    385      studies using small samples.
    386      In conclusion, using this methodology and current data, in ~98% of the comparisons using 87
    387      different regions of the world we found no evidence that the number of deaths/million is reduced
    388      by staying at home. Regional differences in treatment methods and the natural course of the virus
    389      may also be major factors in this pandemic, and further studies are necessary to better understand
    390      it.

    606      Approach for analyzing the time series data
    607      Time series on COVID-19 mortality (deaths/millions) display a non-stationary pattern. The daily                        da
    608      data present a very distinct seasonal behavior on the weekends, with valleys on Saturdayss and                           a
    609      Sundays followed by peaks on Mondays (Figure S1).

    647      Data aggregation by epidemiological week is a plausible alternative. In this way, artificial
    648      seasonality, imposed by work scheduled during weekends and the effect of governmental contr                           ntrol
    649      over social interaction, in a regression framework, are mitigated. The drawback is that the
    650      sample size is significantly reduced from 187 days (Figure S1) to 26 epidemiological weeks.
