    Abstract
    Background
    This research explored awareness, perception, and practice of COVID 19 prevention among residents of
    communities in all the local government areas (districts) in Rivers State during the early stages of the
    pandemic response.
    Design
    This was a descriptive cross-sectional survey which employed an interviewer-administered four-page
    questionnaire built into the Open Data Kit application for android phones. Knowledge and practice
    scores were computed by scoring every correct response/action as 1 and wrong responses as 0.
    Knowledge was graded as excellent for scores of ≥80%, good for scores of 50-79% and poor for scores of
    <50%. Respondents who washed all critical parts of the hand were categorized as having correct
    handwashing practice.
    Setting
    Rivers State in the South-South region of Nigeria had recorded over 2000 cases of COVID 19 as of 18th
    August 2020, ranking 5th among the high burden states in Nigeria. As with any epidemic of an infectious
    nature, panic, fear, and misconceptions are rife. Risk communication utilizes multi-faceted activities
    geared towards facilitating correct and consistent knowledge and prevention practice.
    Participants
    Study involved 1,294 adult community residents in the 23 districts of the state.
    Results
    The respondents were aged between 18 and 80 years with average age of 39.6 years (SD = 11.9 years). A
    total of 710 (54.9%) were male, 476 (36.8%) were unemployed with 685 (52.9%) having secondary
    education. Almost all respondents 1,271 (98.2%) had heard about COVID 19. The three most common
    sources of information about COVID 19 were radio jingles 1102 (86.7%), television adverts 940 (74.0%)
    and announcements in Church 612 (48.2%). Overall, 608 (47.0%) of the respondents had poor
    knowledge of COVID 19. About 1167 (90.2%) of the respondents who were aware of COVID 19
    acknowledged that COVID 19 is a problem in the state while 443 (34.9%) respondents believed they
    were unlikely contract the virus. Only 505 (39.0%) of the respondents washed all critical parts of the
    hand correctly.

    Conclusions
    Risk communication interventions during pandemics need to be based on an understanding of the gaps
    in knowledge, attitude, perceptions, and practice. Broadcast media has a pivotal role to play in risk
    communication for behaviour change for the control of current and future epidemics in this population.

    Introduction
    The novelle coronavirus disease (COVID 19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
    coronavirus 2 (SARS – Cov 2) was first found in Wuhan, China in 2019. 1 The disease spread quickly in
    epic proportions to over 26 countries within eight weeks, prompting the World Health Organization
    (WHO) to declare it a pandemic on the 11th of March 2020.2 The pandemic has had its toll on virtually
    every country in the world, including Nigeria, which recorded its 1st case in February 2020 and has since
    gone on to record over 50 000 cases as at 18th of August 2020.3 Rivers State is in the South-South region
    and a major economic city known for crude oil exploration in the country has had its share of the
    pandemic, with close to over 2000 cases as at 18th of August 2020, following its index case identified on
    the 25th of March 2020 ranking 5th among the high burden states in Nigeria.4
    As with any epidemic of an infectious nature, panic, fear, and misconceptions are rife. This is more so
    because COVID 19 does not presently have a vaccine or a specific cure.1 Coronavirus disease is known to
    be highly infectious but with a low National case fatality rate of 2.1% compared to other epidemic
    diseases like Ebola virus disease (42.1%) and Lassa Fever disease (20.9%) that have hit the country.5 A
    similar picture of misinformation, poor knowledge on disease outbreak and negative behaviours was
    observed during the Ebola epidemic of 2014, which led to a lot of harmful practices carried out by
    people to remain safe.6,7 A study done in China in the early stages of the pandemic showed good
    knowledge and practice of preventive measures against COVID 19 with 98% of respondents wearing a
    facemask when going out. 8 However, in Nigeria, while most people identified radio as their main source
    of information on COVID 19, they attributed the disease to one affecting only the affluent and could not
    be bothered with the practice of preventive measures in the face of economic hardship during the
    lockdown.9,10
    The risk communication pillar of the public health emergency operations centre (PHEOC) is responding
    to the pandemic through multi-faceted activities relating to community mobilization, mass media,

    training of message multipliers, information education and communication (IEC) materials etc. These
    activities are geared towards facilitating correct and consistent information from experts to
    communities at risk to enable them to adopt behaviours to prevent and control COVID 19.12 The efforts
    at flattening the pandemic curve in the South-South region will ultimately depend on the willingness of
    people to adopt and maintain public health preventive health practices as advocated during community
    engagements.
    It is therefore critical that a risk assessment is carried out to explore awareness, perception, and practice
    of COVID 19 prevention among residents of communities in Rivers State. This would advise risk
    communication activities to facilitate desirable behaviour change for COVID 19 and address rumours
    and misconceptions gotten as feedback from the survey.
    Methods
    This was a descriptive cross-sectional survey which took place among community residents in all 23
    Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Rivers State between 18th May to 10th June 2020. Data was collected
    by disease surveillance and notifications officers (DSNOs) who are familiar with the terrain and in each
    LGA and are trained in data collection techniques. A sample size of 1,186 adult respondents was
    calculated based on the sample size formula for single proportions where the prevalence of good
    knowledge about COVID 19 was set at 50% (since there is no previously established prevalence), degree
    of accuracy set at 3% and 10% non-response rate.
    The data collection tool was an interviewer-administered four-page questionnaire built into the Open
    Data Kit application for android phones with GPS tracking. A training was done for the DSNOs on the
    objectives and tools for the study. Data was exported to Microsoft Excel and analysed with SPSS version
    23.
    Major outcome variables studied were knowledge of COVID 19, attitude towards COVID 19 and practice
    of COVID 19 prevention methods. Knowledge score was computed by scoring every correct answer to
    the knowledge questions as 1 and wrong answers as 0. The total knowledge score was computed, and
    the average score calculated by dividing it by the total number of knowledge question. Knowledge was
    then graded as excellent for scores of ≥80%, good for scores of 50-79% and poor for scores of <50%. To
    compute for handwashing practice, respondents who washed all critical parts of the hand were
    categorized as having correct handwashing practice, while those who did not were classified as having
    incorrect handwashing practice. Descriptive statistics was done, and results presented in tables.

    within the State. Radio and Television as potent sources of information for the people and stand out as
    channels for epidemic response efforts. They should therefore be engaged early and effectively. The
    high level of awareness of COVID 19 found in this study, was similar to that obtained in China early in
    the outbreak,8 but contrasted significantly from other studies in Nigeria, where COVID 19 awareness
    remained poor several weeks after the pandemic.9,10 This observed awareness was closely followed by
    good knowledge scores on COVID 19 transmission, signs, and symptoms of the disease such as fever,
    cough and breathing difficulties in more than half of study respondents. This is also commendable

    because knowledge of modes of disease transmission and signs and symptoms of a disease is the first
    proactive step in understanding the measures of disease prevention and control, otherwise known as
    primary prevention. Nevertheless, the good knowledge was not observed for slightly less than half of
    respondents and did not sufficiently translate to good prevention practices among the people. This was
    because while regular hand washing was reported to have been practised by most respondents, only a
    third of the respondents satisfactorily demonstrated all handwashing steps. This supports the assertion
    that knowledge does not always automatically translate into good practice without going through the
    structured stages of declarative, procedural, and autonomous processes involved in the transition from
    knowledge to practice.11 The finding has huge implications for the prevention and control of the
    epidemic in the state and therefore cannot be glossed over by the Risk Communication Pillar of the
    State Public Health Emergency Response. It suggests a paradigm shift in the risk communication process
    in reprogramming its communication strategies to include skills based packages, in order to make any
    significant, meaningful impacts in healthful behaviour change among the people concerning the COVID
    19 virus transmission truncation in the state.
     Also, found was the disturbing fact that a third of participants responded with a stigmatizing attitude
    towards persons who have been treated for COVID 19. This was not peculiar to our study alone as other
    researchers have reported similar occurrences in their environments.12,13 The fact that the disease is
    new, with many unknowns and the fact people are often afraid of the unknown, evokes the fear factor
    among individuals, including community dwellers. It is therefore understandable why there is confusion,
    anxiety, and fear among the public. Unfortunately, however, these factors are also fuelling harmful
    stereotypes and labels of individuals, which in turn drive discrimination and loss of status because of a
    perceived link with the disease.12 The aftermath of which can drive the epidemic underground by
    making people hide the illness to avoid discrimination, prevent people from seeking health care
    immediately and discourage them from adopting healthy behaviours. All of these can result in more
    severe health problems in the State by increasing the difficulties of controlling the disease outbreak.
    Another salient issue that might have promoted stigma and discrimination was the unprofessional
    manner the print and broadcast media portrayed the disease at inception, as a highly infectious and
    deadly disease. And this created a lot of panic in the minds of the people as many persons developed
    the perception that the disease as a huge problem. This thus created a paradox in the COVID 19 risk
    communication in the State and further underscores the importance of periodic media engagement and
    capacity building in ethical reporting and accurate information dissemination since the media are critical

    partners in disease outbreak response.14
    This study brings to the fore the relevance of adopting skills-based approaches in health risk
    communication and the timely and effective media engagement on ethical reporting of health matters
    during disease outbreaks to mitigate stereotyping, stigmatization and discrimination, all which have
    severe implications for epidemic prevention and control.15 It is therefore recommended that the Risk
    Communication Pillar of the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre for COVID 19 in Rivers State
    reprogramme its communication strategy to include sufficient practice elements that demonstrate the
    correct COVID 19 prevention methods like hand hygiene, social distancing and appropriate use of face
    masks.
    The study was of a cross-sectional design which was based on self-reporting and therefore subject to
    information bias, whereby respondents might choose not to give information as required. However, the
    large sample size and spread of respondents across all the LGAs of the state make this a relevant piece
    of research.
    Conclusion
    Risk communication interventions during pandemics need to be based on an understanding of the gaps
    in knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and practice. Patronised communication channels such as
    broadcast media should be maximally utilized to foster behaviour change communication for the control
    of current and future epidemics.
