12     Abstract
13     The growing toll of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the urgency of identifying
14     individuals most at risk of infection and severe outcomes, underscoring the need to assess
15     susceptibility and severity patterns in large datasets.1 The AncestryDNA COVID-19 Study
16     collected self-reported survey data on symptoms, outcomes, risk factors, and exposures for over
17     563,000 adult individuals in the U.S., including over 4,700 COVID-19 cases as measured by a
18     self-reported positive nasal swab test. We observed significant associations between several risk
19     factors and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity outcomes. Many of the susceptibility
20     associations were accounted for by differences in known exposures; a notable exception was
21     elevated susceptibility odds for males after adjusting for known exposures and age. We also
22     leveraged the dataset to build risk models to robustly predict individualized COVID-19
23     susceptibility (area under the curve [AUC]=0.84) and severity outcomes including
24     hospitalization and life-threatening critical illness amongst COVID-19 cases (AUC=0.87 and
25     0.90, respectively). The results highlight the value of self-reported epidemiological data at scale
26     to provide public health insights into the evolving COVID-19 pandemic.

28     Main
29     The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in nearly 35 million COVID-19 cases and more than
30     1,000,000 deaths worldwide,2 including nearly 7.5 million cases and more than 210,000 deaths in
31     the United States as of early October 2020.3 The growing impact of the pandemic intensifies the
32     need for enhanced understanding of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity risk factors, not only
33     for public health experts, but also for individuals seeking to assess their own personalized risk.
34     Prior research has hypothesized that differences in COVID-19 susceptibility are related to age,4
35     sex-dependent immune responses,5 and genetics,6,7 while heightened severity of COVID-19
36     illness is associated with risk factors such as age,1,4,8,9 sex,5,10–12 underlying health
37     conditions,1,9,10,13,14 and genetic factors including the ABO blood group.15 Self-reported survey
38     data, which can easily be collected in the home, afford the opportunity to dynamically monitor
39     the continually evolving pandemic and allow for real-time estimation of individual-level
40     COVID-19 risk.16–19 Furthermore, self-reported surveys allow for collection of information about
41     known exposures, of which few epidemiological COVID-19 studies have explicitly accounted
42     for in association analyses to date.20
43
44     In this paper, we aim to provide insight into factors associated with susceptibility and severity of
45     COVID-19 using a large survey cohort of 563,141 AncestryDNA customers who have consented
46     to participate in the AncestryDNA COVID-19 Study (Supplementary Tables 1-6).6 We found
47     that known exposure differences account for many associations for a positive COVID-19 test
48     result.18,21 Further analysis yielded evidence that males may be more susceptible to COVID-19
49     than females after adjusting for known exposures and age. While several previous reports have
50     documented increased severity risk in males,5,11,13 the finding of sex-based differences in
                                                                          2

51     susceptibility here warrants further investigation. This study also replicates previous reports of
52     strong associations between certain health conditions, age, and COVID-19 severity,1,8–14 many of
53     which remain significant after adjusting for other risk factors. We additionally investigated the
54     symptomotology of COVID-19, and found that the symptoms most strongly associated with a
55     positive test result are distinct from the symptoms most strongly associated with severity.17,18,22,23
56
57     Finally, we built predictive risk models for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity outcomes. For
58     susceptibility, we designed two models and additionally applied two literature-based models18 to
59     predict COVID-19 cases among respondents reporting a test result. We also designed models to
60     predict two different COVID-19 severity outcomes based on minimal information about
61     demographics, health conditions, and symptoms: hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection
62     (referred to throughout as “hospitalization”) and progression of an infection to a life-threatening
63     critical case among those reporting a positive COVID-19 result (referred to throughout as
64     “critical case”; Methods).13 All of the susceptibility and severity models performed robustly
65     when evaluated in a large internal holdout dataset, and could potentially serve as tools for
66     understanding individualized COVID-19 susceptibility and severity risk.1,16–19,24 Assessing
67     model performance in different populations offers insight into how well a risk model may
68     generalize to the broader population. We assessed all of the risk models across different age, sex
69     and genetic ancestry cohorts, and we report reasonably high performance in all cohorts.

71     Survey description. Survey responses were collected from AncestryDNA customers (see
72     Methods and Supplementary Table 3 for demographic information). The survey collected self-
73     reported responses to questions about COVID-19 test results, 15 symptoms among those who
74     tested positive or who tested negative and had flu-like symptoms, disease progression for
                                                                          3

75     positive testers, age, height, weight, known exposures to biological relatives, household
76     members, patients or any other contacts with COVID-19, and 11 underlying health conditions
77     (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Data were collected between 22 April 2020 and 6 July 2020,
78     and the survey completion rate was approximately 95%. In general, the COVID-19 positive test
79     rate and self-reported clinical outcomes are consistent with those reported by the U.S. Centers for
80     Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) over a similar period (Supplementary Note 1).21

 82     Association Analyses
 83     Susceptibility. We investigated associations between COVID-19 testers reporting a positive or
 84     negative result and risk factors within the dataset (Figure 1, Methods, Supplementary Tables 7-
 85     12). Unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using simple logistic regression, and adjusted
 86     ORs (aORs) were calculated using multiple logistic regression including known exposures, age,
 87     and sex as risk factors. Unadjusted ORs provide insight into which individual variables are
 88     correlated with testing positive for COVID-19, while adjusted ORs provide insight into which of
 89     these associations are not completely explained due to differences in age, sex, and known
 90     exposures.25
 91     Known COVID-19 exposures, either through a household case (OR=26.03; 95% confidence
 92     interval [CI]=(22.26, 30.43)), biological relative (OR=5.77; 95% CI=(4.99, 6.68)), or other
 93     source of “direct” exposure (OR=6.94; 95% CI=(6.02, 7.99)) were the strongest predictors of a
 94     positive COVID-19 test result (Figure 1, Supplementary Table 7). In general, adjusting for
 95     known exposures, age, and sex resulted in attenuation of the ORs, with many associations
 96     becoming insignificant after adjustment (Figure 1, Supplementary Tables 8-9). Intriguingly, the
 97     OR for males was not attenuated after adjustment, and males remained at elevated odds after
 98     adjusting for known exposures and age (aOR=1.36; 95% CI=(1.19, 1.55);                                                Figure 1,
 99     Supplementary Table 9). We also note that males and females reported comparable exposure
100     burden, with males slightly more likely to report a household case of COVID-19 but less likely
101     to report a case of COVID-19 among biological relatives (Supplementary Tables 11-12).

103     Younger individuals (ages 18-29; OR=1.51; 95% CI=(1.26, 1.81)), as well as individuals of
104     admixed African-European (OR=1.48; 95% CI=(1.18, 1.85)) or admixed Amerindian ancestry
105     (OR=1.49; 95% CI=(1.26, 1.77)) were significantly more likely to test positive compared to
106     older individuals (ages 50-64, the largest age group in this cohort) or those of European ancestry,
107     respectively (Supplementary Table 7). These individuals reported higher levels of COVID-19
108     cases within the household, cases among biological relatives, and/or other known “direct”
109     COVID-19 exposures (Supplementary Tables 10-12).26–30 Adjusting for age (ancestry groups
110     only), sex, and known exposures attenuated the OR for all three of these groups (younger
111     aOR=1.28; 95% CI=(1.03, 1.59), African-European aOR=1.23; 95% CI=(0.94, 1.62), and
112     Amerindian aOR=1.27; 95% CI=(1.04, 1.57); Figure 1, Supplementary Table 9).
113
114     Individuals reporting pre-existing medical conditions (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disease,
115     chronic kidney disease [CKD], diabetes, hypertension) were less likely to test positive for
116     COVID-19 (Figure 1, Supplementary Table 7). We observed significantly decreased odds of a
117     known “direct” exposure to COVID-19, as well as significantly decreased odds of a household
118     case of COVID-19, among such individuals relative to those without any health conditions
119     (OR=0.71; 95% CI=(0.65, 0.78) and OR=0.74; 95% CI=(0.65, 0.84), respectively;
120     Supplementary Tables 10-11). Notably, individuals with asthma and those with other lung
121     conditions had significantly decreased odds of testing positive after adjusting for known
122     exposures, age, and sex (OR=0.82; 95% CI=(0.69, 0.97) and OR=0.67; 95% CI=(0.44, 1.00),
123     respectively; Supplementary Table 9).

125     Severity. We investigated associations between demographics, exposures, symptoms, and
126     underlying health conditions for hospitalization and critical illness progression among COVID-
127     19 cases (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 1). Consistent with previous reports,1,9,12–14 we
128     observed positive associations between certain health conditions and COVID-19 severity
129     outcomes; many of these associations remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and
130     obesity (BMI >= 30) (Figure 2, Supplementary Tables 13-16). COVID-19 cases reporting at least
131     one underlying health condition were significantly more likely to progress to a critical case
132     (OR=2.85; 95% CI=(1.78, 4.57); Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Table 15).
133     Specific underlying health conditions that were associated with hospitalization and/or critical
134     case progression included CKD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes,
135     cardiovascular disease, and hypertension (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary
136     Tables 13 and 15). Among individuals testing positive for COVID-19, the oldest (≥65 years)
137     were significantly more likely to be hospitalized compared to those aged 50-64 (OR=1.70; 95%
138     CI=(1.13, 2.56); Figure 2, Supplementary Table 13). Individuals of admixed African-European
139     ancestry who tested positive were significantly more likely to report progression to a critical
140     case, compared to those with European ancestry (OR=2.07; 95% CI=(1.03, 4.17); Supplementary
141     Figure 1, Supplementary Table 15). Among COVID-19 cases, males were significantly more
142     likely than females to report progression to a critical case (OR=1.54, 95%; CI=(1.00, 2.37);
143     Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Table 15); these findings are consistent with CDC
144     reports of increased ICU admittance rates in males (3% vs. 2%).21

146     Differential symptomology. Among symptomatic people who were reported a COVID-19 test
147     result, those reporting moderate to severe change in taste or smell (OR=7.26; 95% CI=(5.54,
148     9.50)), fever (OR=1.60; 95% CI=(1.28, 2.01)), or feeling tired or fatigue (OR=1.41; 95%
149     CI=(1.05, 1.89)) were more likely to test positive (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 7). Those
150     reporting moderate to severe runny nose (OR=0.59; 95% CI=(0.47, 0.75)) or sore throat
151     (OR=0.49; 95% CI=(0.39, 0.62)) were more likely to test negative, consistent with previous
152     reports that these symptoms are more indicative of influenza or the common cold (Figure 3,
153     Supplementary Table 7).17,18,22 Change in taste or smell, a hallmark symptom of COVID-19
154     infection, was not associated with hospitalization (OR=0.77, 95% CI=(0.55, 1.07); Figure 3,
155     Supplementary Table 13). By contrast, dyspnea (shortness of breath) was the most predictive of
156     hospitalization and critical case progression (OR=7.52; 95% CI=(4.92, 11.49) and OR=11.55;
157     95% CI=(5.91, 22.59), respectively),23 but was not associated with a positive test result
158     (OR=1.14; 95% CI=(0.91, 1.44); Figure 3, Supplementary Tables 7, 13, and 15).

160     Predictive risk models. We developed models that predict an individual’s COVID-19 risk
161     (positive test result or severity). Many predictive models for COVID-19 infection and severity
162     outcomes have been reported in the literature.1,16–18,24,31 To date, few large-scale studies have
163     investigated both susceptibility and severity risk within the same dataset, offering a consistent
164     and comprehensive understanding of similarities and differences between the two outcomes.
165     For each of the risk models we developed, the survey data were divided into independent training
166     and test cohorts, and additional association analyses were performed on the training data to guide
167     the selection of risk factors for the models (Methods, Supplementary Tables 17-20). In contrast
168     to association analyses, these risk models are based on penalized logistic regression with cross-
169     validation in order to allow for transferability to independent cohorts.
170     The susceptibility models were designed to predict a COVID-19 result (positive or negative)
171     from risk factors among testers. In addition to our own two models, we also replicated two self-
172     reported models from the literature in order to assess how well our models perform relative to a
173     respected benchmark.18 In all, we compared four models: our model based on demographics and
174     exposures (referred to throughout as “Dem + Exp”); our model based on demographics,
175     exposures, and symptoms (referred to throughout as “Dem + Exp + Symp”); and the two
176     literature-based models designed with nearly identical risk factors as reported previously in
177     another large, self-reported study (“How We Feel” (HWF); models referred to as “HWF Exp +
178     Symp” and “HWF Symp” throughout; Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Table 20).18
179
180     All four susceptibility models performed robustly, with the Dem + Exp + Symp model achieving
181     the highest overall performance (Figure 4, Supplementary Tables 21-24). The three models that
                                                                           9

182     included one or more symptoms outperformed the model without symptoms (Dem + Exp),
183     underscoring the value of self-reported symptoms for discriminating between cases and controls.
184     The Dem + Exp model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 +/- 0.02, and the most
185     predictive risk factor was having a household case of COVID-19. The Dem + Exp + Symp
186     model had an AUC of 0.94 +/- 0.02, and the most predictive symptom was change in taste or
187     smell. The HWF Exp + Symp model had an AUC of 0.90 +/- 0.03, and the HWF Symp model
188     had an AUC of 0.87 +/- 0.03 (Supplementary Note 3). Each of the models performed comparably
189     across different age, sex, and genetic ancestry cohorts (Figure 4, Supplementary Tables 21-24).
190     We observed no significant overfitting in any of the models as evidenced by comparable train-
191     test performances (Supplementary Table 25).
192
193     We also trained severity models to predict hospitalization and critical illness progression among
194     COVID-19 cases. We included a number of risk factors and symptoms most associated with
195     severe COVID-19 outcomes from the literature and/or our training dataset (Figure 3,

197     40),1,32 and health conditions,1,9,12–14 as well as shortness of breath,23 fever, feeling tired or
198     fatigue, dry cough, and diarrhea for symptoms. Both models performed robustly on an
199     independent holdout dataset (Figure 4). The hospitalization model had an AUC of 0.87 +/- 0.03,
200     and the critical case model had an AUC of 0.90 +/- 0.03. For both severity models, shortness of
201     breath was the most predictive risk factor. We were concerned that this might seem obvious, so
202     we designed models excluding this symptom which also achieved moderately high
203     discriminative performance (AUC > 0.80; Supplementary Figure 5). The severity models
204     performed comparably when stratifying by age, sex, and genetic ancestry (Figure 4,
                                                                          10

206     comparable train-test performances (Supplementary Table 25).
207
208     In contrast with susceptibility models, we did not evaluate the severity models against literature-
209     based models, as the vast majority of these models include clinical factors (e.g., bloodwork) not
210     measured in this self-reported dataset.1,16,31 However, the models presented here perform on par
211     with many previously reported models despite the absence of clinical factors, suggesting the
212     potential value of self-reported data to identify the most at-risk COVID-19 individuals.16,31
213
214     Discussion. The AncestryDNA COVID-19 Study provides a highly complete, self-reported
215     dataset that contains information about a plethora of risk factors in the context of COVID-19
216     susceptibility and severity outcomes. The self-report framework provides fast, low-cost,
217     population-scale data that are particularly valuable in a pandemic, where knowledge is both
218     limited and evolving rapidly based on changing circumstances. Additionally, the broad collection
219     mechanism enables data-gathering from many more and potentially more diverse participants
220     than typically seen in a medical setting, and participants can safely provide data from their
221     homes. Moreover, self-reported data have been shown to be useful for estimating population
222     prevalence,19 and models built from these data may help to contextualize individual risk prior to
223     infection with COVID-19.1,16–18,24,31
224
225     The study highlights exposure burden as the primary risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility,
226     and the importance of accounting for known exposures when assessing differences in
227     susceptibility to COVID-19. Few studies have measured and explicitly adjusted for known
                                                                          11

228     COVID-19 exposures at this scale.20 We found elevated exposure levels for younger individuals,
229     as well as individuals of admixed African-European or admixed Amerindian ancestry, which
230     account for at least some of the elevated susceptibility risk for these individuals as evidenced by
231     attenuation of ORs after adjustment for known exposures and age. This finding is consistent with
232     previous reports about elevated exposure levels for younger and minority groups within the
233     U.S.26–30 By contrast, we found reduced exposure levels among those reporting one or more pre-
234     existing health conditions. The lower exposure burden observed for these individuals may reflect
235     pre-pandemic differences in public interactions or increased precautions to mitigate exposure,
236     given published severity risks associated with these conditions.1,9,13,14,33,34
237
238     Importantly, we found elevated susceptibility risk in males after adjusting for age and known
239     exposures, and the adjusted odds were not attenuated compared to the unadjusted odds. This
240     finding is distinct from previous findings on elevated severity risk in males.1,5,11 This result could
241     be due to differences between men and women in behaviors, unknown exposures, biology,
242     genetics,5–7 or other risk factors not measured within this dataset.
243
244     Another major contribution of this study is the development of novel risk models for predicting
245     an individual’s COVID-19 susceptibility and severity risk. The risk models presented here
246     perform comparably or better than similar and more complex models reported previously.16–
        18,24,31
247              Although some previously reported risk models have been assessed in different age or sex
248     cohorts,16,17 we are not aware of any that have been assessed across genetic ancestry cohorts,1,16–
        18,24,31
249              highlighting the potential utility and generalizability of these models to the broader
250     population. Such models may be useful to clinicians to estimate an individual’s risk of infection
                                                                          12

251     and/or severity risk, or as a potential tool to triage testing given limited resources.17,18,22 Just as
252     importantly, the models could also be used by public health experts to understand population-
253     level risk at large, given minimal self-reported risk factor data.
254
255     The COVID-19 pandemic has exacted a historic toll on healthcare systems and global
256     economies, and continues to evolve based on changes in human behavior, public health
257     guidelines, and societal factors. The large AncestryDNA network, well-established data
258     collection mechanisms, and willingness of AncestryDNA customers to participate in COVID-19
259     research have rapidly come together in this study to elucidate more details about susceptibility
260     and severe disease risk factors and help point the way to minimizing disease burden.

268     Study population. Collection of self-reported COVID-19 outcomes from AncestryDNA
269     customers who consented to research, participation criteria for the study, and the survey design
270     are described in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a very similar AncestryDNA
271     dataset, which identified three novel, genome-wide significant loci.6 Here, participants reporting
272     a negative test result were also assessed for symptoms and clinical outcomes. Analyses presented
273     here were performed with data collected between 22 April and 6 July 2020.
274     Outcome definitions. The study assessed three outcomes: one for susceptibility and two for
275     severity of COVID-19 infection. Cases for COVID-19 susceptibility were individuals who
276     responded, “Yes, and was positive” to the question, “Have you been swab tested for COVID-19,
277     commonly referred to as coronavirus?” Responders who answered, “Yes, and was negative”
278     were used as controls for the susceptibility analysis.
279     The hospitalization outcome was defined among COVID-19-positive cases if a participant
280     responded "Yes" to a binary question about experiencing symptoms due to COVID-19 illness
281     and "Yes" to the hospitalization question ("Were you hospitalized due to these symptoms?).
282     Controls were defined by a response of “No” to the hospitalization question in addition to
283     reporting a self-reported positive COVID-19 test result.6
284
285     Critical cases of COVID-19 were defined via a response of “Yes” to one or more questions about
286     ICU admittance (“Were you hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit [ICU] with a ventilator?” or
287     “Were you hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit [ICU] with oxygen?”) or, alternatively, self-
288     reported septic shock, organ failure, or respiratory failure resulting from a COVID-19 infection
289     (“Have you had any of the following complications due to your illness? Select all that apply.”).13
                                                                          15

290     Controls were defined by a response of “No” across all of these questions in addition to self-
291     reporting a positive COVID-19 test result.
292
293     Genetic sex and ancestry definitions. All individuals were genotyped, using previously
294     described general genotyping and quality control procedures.35 Both sex and genetic ancestry
295     were defined for individuals based on their genotypes. Genetic ancestry was estimated using a
296     proprietary algorithm to estimate continental admixture proportions.36 Briefly, this algorithm
297     uses a hidden Markov model to estimate unphased diploid ancestry across the genome by
298     comparing haplotype structure to a reference panel.
299
300     Data preparation for analysis. Multiple-choice categorical questions were one-hot (“dummy”)
301     encoded as binary risk factors with k-1 degrees of freedom, where k corresponds to the number
302     of fields for a given question. In this framework, a value of 0 across all k-1 fields corresponds to
303     a response of “None” or “None of the above” for a given question.
304
305     We considered several risk factors and outcomes questions in our association analyses and risk
306     modeling efforts, some of which are summarized in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Based on the
307     dependency structure within our survey, not every question was surfaced to every participant
308     included within our study. As such, we made the following inferences:
309          ● Participants reporting “No” to a binary question about symptoms arising from COVID-19
310               infection (“Did you experience symptoms as a result of your condition?”) were
311               designated as negatives for dependent questions about individual symptoms (“Between
312               the beginning of February 2020 and now, have you had any of the following

314               symptoms?”), ICU admittance due to symptoms (“Were you hospitalized in the Intensive
315               Care Unit [ICU] with a ventilator?” or “Were you hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit
316               ([ICU] with oxygen?”), and medications prescribed due to symptoms (“Did a doctor treat
317               you with medication for your illness?”)
318          ● Participants reporting “No” to a binary question about hospitalization (“Were you
319               hospitalized due to these symptoms?”) were assigned to a hospital duration of 0 days and
320               designated as negative for ICU admittance due to symptoms.
321          ● Participants reporting “No” to a binary question about medications prescribed due to
322               symptoms (“Did a doctor treat you with medication for your illness?”) were designated as
323               negative for individual medication fields from a dependent question ("What medication
324               were you treated with?”).
325
326     Responses to a question about individual symptoms (“Between the beginning of February 2020
327     and now, have you had any of the following symptoms?”) were converted to a binary variable
328     based on the following mapping: 0 = None, Very Mild, Mild; 1 = Moderate, Severe, Very
329     Severe.
                                                                          17

330     Association analysis. Analyses were performed either with the statsmodels package in Python3
331     or in base R with the glm function. For each susceptibility and severity outcome and risk factor
332     of interest, a simple logistic regression (LR) model was fit using unpenalized maximum
333     likelihood.37 LR models were fit on the entire cohort, except for age, sex, genetic ancestry, and
334     obesity, where the models were fit only on the appropriate reference population drawn from the
335     entire cohort (Supplementary Tables 7-16). Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust the
336     ORs for known COVID-19 exposures and potentially confounding risk factors. The adjusted
337     model includes age, sex, and four known exposures for susceptibility outcomes (Y/N if any); and
338     age, sex, obesity (binarized if BMI >= 30), and health conditions (binarized if any) for severity
339     outcomes (Figures 1 and 2). Individual adjustment variables were omitted when analyzing
340     associations for risk factors within equivalent categories (e.g., age was not included in adjusted
341     models for age bin risk factors).
342
343     For each risk factor, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the log odds ratio were estimated under
344     the normal approximation. The significance threshold was Bonferroni-corrected for the 42
345     different risk factors examined, leading to an adjusted threshold of 0.05/42=0.0012.37

347     Risk model training and evaluation
348     Data splitting. All data were used in the OR analyses; data splitting was performed for risk
349     modeling only. Prior to model training, the data were split with a fixed random seed. For
350     susceptibility models without symptoms, 75% of the data were used for model training and 25%
351     of the data were used for holdout evaluation. For severity models and susceptibility models with
352     symptoms, 50% of the data were used for model training and 50% of the data were used for
353     holdout evaluation. The larger holdout set allows for more robust stratified analyses of model
354     performances, given the smaller overall cohort sizes for models with symptoms.
355
356     Predictive risk models. Logistic regression models were trained and evaluated using the scikit-
357     learn package in Python. Here, we used lasso-penalized multiple logistic regression with cross-
358     validation on the training dataset in order to select an optimal hyperparameterization for
359     generalizability to independent test sets.37 The penalized objective function for regression was
360     weighted by inverse prevalence to address class imbalance and was framed as follows:

372     Risk factor selection and model training. We chose risk factors based on a minimal subset of
373     nominally significant ORs within our training data as well as literature guidance.1,4,5,9,11–14 For
374     the susceptibility models without symptoms, we included a subset of exposure-related questions,
375     based on the training OR analyses, as well as two demographic variables (age and sex). For
376     susceptibility models with symptoms, we additionally included the five symptoms most
377     differentiated between symptomatic negative and positive testers from our training ORs. For the
378     severity models, we included pre-existing conditions, based on the training OR analyses,
379     predictive symptoms within our training dataset36, morbid obesity (BMI >= 40), age, and sex.
380     The full list of risk factors for each model is included in Supplementary Table 20.
381
382     Once final risk factors were selected, we performed 5-fold cross-validation with grid search on
383     our training dataset to select an optimal lasso regularization parameter lambda.37 For the grid
384     search, we scanned 8 different values for lambda, equally partitioned geometrically across a 4-
385     log space. We then re-trained on the entire training dataset with the optimal lambda, and
386     evaluated the final model on the holdout dataset.

388     Model thresholding. Phenotypes were predicted from the output of trained models based on a
389     50% probability threshold (i.e., logistic model output > 0.5). Sensitivity and specificity were then
390     calculated based on the true vs. predicted binary outcomes.

392     Estimation of performance error. To estimate the error in our model performances, we
393     bootstrapped our holdout dataset 1,000 times to generate a sampling distribution for each
394     evaluation metric. We estimated the mean and 95% CIs for each metric based on the mean and
395     standard deviation of this sampling distribution.37

486     Supplementary Note 1. Comparison of AncestryDNA Data to CDC Data. In general, the
487     COVID-19 testing results are consistent with those reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease
488     Control and Prevention (CDC) over a similar period.21 For example, the CDC reported a 12%
489     cumulative overall positive test rate from 1 March to 30 May 2020, while 14.1% of
490     AncestryDNA survey participants reported testing positive (the denominator includes tests with
491     “results pending”). For hospitalization, the CDC reported that 14% of individuals testing positive
492     for COVID-19 were hospitalized, and 2% were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), between
493     22 January and 30 May 2020. Among the AncestryDNA survey respondents, 11% of those
494     reporting a positive COVID-19 test were hospitalized, and 4.9% were admitted to ICU between
495     22 April and 6 July 2020.

497     Supplementary Note 2. Risk factors for predictive susceptibility models. The HWF Exp +
498     Symp model includes three risk factors, including two exposures and one symptom (change in
499     taste or smell, Supplementary Table 20). The HWF Symp model includes seven symptoms most
500     commonly associated with COVID-19 according to the CDC (Supplementary Table 20).18,38 For
501     the Dem + Exp and Dem + Exp + Symp models, we incorporated responses to several exposure
502     questions that were primary risk factors in the OR analysis of the training set (Methods and
503     Supplementary Table 20).18,39,40 We also considered age and sex, given their nominal association
504     with COVID-19 in our ORs in the training dataset, as well as reports about these variables as
                                                                          32

505     risk factors (Supplementary Table 17).4,5,30 For Dem + Exp + Symp model, we selected the most
506     differentiated symptoms between cases and controls amongst symptomatic COVID-19 testers
507     within the training dataset (Supplementary Table 17), including fever, change in taste or smell,
508     feeling tired/fatigued, runny nose, and sore throat.17,18,22

510     Supplementary Note 3. Comparison of Ancestry and HWF Cohorts and Performances. The
511     HWF models performed better when trained and evaluated on the AncestryDNA dataset as
512     compared with the HWF dataset, particularly for the symptoms-only model (HWF Symp:
513     AncestryDNA-trained AUC=0.87 and HWF-trained AUC=0.76 and HWF Exp + Symp:
514     AncestryDNA-trained AUC=0.90 and HWF-trained AUC=0.87; Figure 4).18 This result could be
515     due to differences in survey flow design, demographics, or the relative prevalences of self-
516     reported symptoms between the two datasets. We re-trained and evaluated our models on a
517     subset of symptomatic COVID-19 testers (positives and negatives) reporting at least one
518     symptom of moderate or greater intensity. The performances of all models that included
519     symptoms were slightly attenuated in this cohort, with AUCs for the HWF models approaching
520     previous reports (HWF Symp: AncestryDNA-trained AUC=0.80 and HWF Exp + Symp:
521     AncestryDNA-trained AUC=0.87); the model without symptoms performed the same
522     (Supplementary Figure 4). This suggests that predicting COVID-19 cases on the basis of
523     symptoms alone is more challenging when symptoms are less differentiated between positive and
524     negative testers.

560     Unadjusted odds ratios for a positive COVID-19 test were calculated among survey participants
561     reporting a test result (positive or negative) based on the self-reported response to the following
562     question: “Have you been swab tested for COVID-19, commonly referred to as coronavirus?”
563     The following groups served as reference populations for the odds ratio calculations: European
564     genetic ancestry (Genetic Ancestry), Ages 50-64 (Age), Female (Genetic Sex), and Not Obese
565     (BMI < 30, Obesity). Note that symptoms odds ratios were calculated in a binary fashion among
566     symptomatic customers only (Methods).

571     Adjusted odds ratios for a positive COVID-19 test were calculated among survey participants
572     reporting a test result (positive or negative) based on the self-reported response to the following
573     question: “Have you been swab tested for COVID-19, commonly referred to as coronavirus?”
574     The following groups served as reference populations for the odds ratio calculations: European
575     genetic ancestry (Genetic Ancestry), Ages 50-64 (Age), Female (Genetic Sex), and Not Obese
576     (BMI < 30, Obesity). Note that symptoms odds ratios were calculated in a binary fashion among

584     Adjusted odds ratios for a positive COVID-19 test were calculated among survey participants
585     reporting a test result (positive or negative) based on the self-reported response to the following
586     question: “Have you been swab tested for COVID-19, commonly referred to as coronavirus?”
587     The following groups served as reference populations for the odds ratio calculations: European
588     genetic ancestry (Genetic Ancestry), Ages 50-64 (Age), Female (Genetic Sex), and Not Obese
589     (BMI < 30, Obesity). Note that symptoms odds ratios were calculated in a binary fashion among
                                                                             46

598     Unadjusted odds ratios for a known “direct” exposure to COVID-19 were calculated based on
599     the self-reported response to the following question: “Have you been directly exposed to
600     someone who has tested positive for COVID-19?” The following groups served as reference
601     populations for the odds ratio calculations: European genetic ancestry (Genetic Ancestry), Ages
602     50-64 (Age), Female (Genetic Sex), and Not Obese (BMI < 30, Obesity).

643     Unadjusted odds ratios for a case(s) of COVID-19 among close biological relatives (grandparent,
644     parent, child, or sibling) were calculated based on the self-reported response to the following
645     question: “Have any of your biological relatives tested positive for COVID-19? Select all that
646     apply.” The following groups served as reference populations for the odds ratio calculations:
647     European genetic ancestry (Genetic Ancestry), Ages 50-64 (Age), Female (Genetic Sex), and
648     Not Obese (BMI < 30, Obesity).

678     Female (Genetic Sex), and Not Obese (BMI < 30, Obesity). Note that symptoms odds ratios
679     were calculated in a binary fashion among symptomatic customers only (Methods). Here, odds
680     ratios were adjusted for age, sex, comorbitidies (Y/N if any), and obesity (Y/N if BMI > 30,

698     Adjusted odds ratios for progression of COVID-19 infection to a critical, life-threatening illness
699     were calculated among those reporting a positive COVID-19 test result. The following groups
700     served as reference populations for the odds ratio calculations: European genetic ancestry
701     (Genetic Ancestry), Ages 50-64 (Age), Female (Genetic Sex), and Not Obese (BMI < 30,
702     Obesity). Note that symptoms odds ratios were calculated in a binary fashion among
703     symptomatic customers only (Methods). Here, odds ratios were adjusted for age, sex,
704     comorbitidies (Y/N if any), and obesity (Y/N if BMI > 30, Methods).

708     Unadjusted odds ratios for a positive COVID-19 test were calculated among survey participants
709     reporting a test result (positive or negative). The following groups served as reference
710     populations for the odds ratio calculations: European genetic ancestry (Genetic Ancestry), Ages
711     50-64 (Age), Female (Genetic Sex), and Not Obese (BMI < 30, Obesity). Note that symptoms
712     odds ratios were calculated in a binary fashion among symptomatic customers only (Methods).

718     Unadjusted odds ratios for hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection were calculated among
719     those reporting a positive COVID-19 test result. The following groups served as reference
720     populations for the odds ratio calculations: European genetic ancestry (Genetic Ancestry), Ages
721     50-64 (Age), Female (Genetic Sex), and Not Obese (BMI < 30, Obesity). Note that symptoms
722     odds ratios were calculated in a binary fashion among symptomatic customers only (Methods).

728     Unadjusted odds ratios for progression of COVID-19 infection to a critical, life-threatening
729     illness were calculated among those reporting a positive COVID-19 test result. The following
730     groups served as reference populations for the odds ratio calculations: European genetic ancestry
731     (Genetic Ancestry), Ages 50-64 (Age), Female (Genetic Sex), and Not Obese (BMI < 30,
732     Obesity). Note that symptoms odds ratios were calculated in a binary fashion among
733     symptomatic customers only (Methods).

747     Case/control status is defined based on a self-reported COVID-19 positive test result. The Dem +
748     Exp model includes questions about exposures, age, and sex (Supplementary Table 20). Metric
749     performance columns reflect mean and nominal 95% confidence intervals for each metric on an
750     internal, independent holdout dataset (Methods). Cohort-level receiver operator characteristic
751     (ROC) curves were constructed from predicted class probabilities of models trained on the entire
752     training dataset (Methods).

820     Case/control status is defined based on self-reported critical case progression among all COVID-
821     19 cases. Here, a critical case is defined based on self-reported ICU admittance, respiratory
822     failure, organ failure, or septic shock resulting from COVID-19-related illness (Methods). Metric
823     performance columns reflect mean and nominal 95% confidence intervals for each metric on an
824     internal, independent holdout dataset (Methods). Cohort-level receiver operator characteristic
825     (ROC) curves were constructed from predicted class probabilities of models trained on the entire
826     survey cohort (Methods).

833     intervals (CIs) estimated from simple (“Unadjusted models,” grey) and multiple
834     (“Adjusted models,” black) logistic regression with adjustment for other risk factors. Open
835     circles indicate not significant (p-value > 0.05) after accounting for multiple hypothesis tests
836     using Bonferroni correction. Age, sex, genetic ancestry, and obesity ORs were estimated in
837     relation to the reference variables indicated. Exposure, health, and symptom ORs were each
838     estimated separately as binary variables. Symptom ORs were estimated as binary variables
839     among symptomatic testers only (Methods). Risk factor adjustments for severity include: sex,
840     age, obesity (Y/N), and underlying health conditions (Y/N if any). Where applicable, individual
841     adjustment variables were omitted to avoid duplicate adjustment (Methods).
