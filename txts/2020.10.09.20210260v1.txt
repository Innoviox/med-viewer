  The global fight against COVID-19 is plagued by asymptomatic transmission and false negatives. Group
  testing is increasingly recognized as necessary to fight this epidemic. I examine the gains from
  considering heterogeneous interpersonal interactions (homophily), which induce potential
  contamination, when designing testing pools. Homophily can be identified ex ante at a scale
  commensurate with pool size, so that the risk of contamination is higher within a well-designed pool
  than with an outsider. This makes it possible to overcome the usual information-theoretic limits of
  group testing which rely on an implicit homogeneity assumption. More importantly, group testing with
  homophily detects asymptomatic carriers that would be missed even by exhaustive individual testing
  because of false negatives. Such a strategy should be implemented at least at a weekly frequency to
  fit the time profile of test positivity. It can be used either to avoid unnecessary lockdowns or to make
  lockdowns more efficient.

  1. Introduction
  The present study analyzes the potential gains from taking homophily into account when
  implementing pool testing to fight epidemics with asymptomatic carriers and false negatives. It shows
  that designing test pools that encompass potential contamination clusters improves the efficiency of
  tests significantly, and makes it possible, in combination with more advanced complementary exams,
  to identify carriers that would be missed even by exhaustive (and unfeasible) individual testing.
  Various strategies have been implemented to curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Trace and track may be
  efficient (Normile, 2020) but can be thwarted by asocial behaviors or religious beliefs (see patient 31
  in South Korea) and tracking teams are overwhelmed when incidence is too high. Lockdowns and
  quarantine work (World Health Organization, 2020, Kupferschmidt and Cohen, 2020) but are costly
  (Gourinchas, 2020). The need for testing, which can substantially reduce the need for indiscriminate
  quarantines, was identified early in the epidemic (Piguillem and Shi, 2020).
  Massive and timely identification of asymptomatic disease carriers is crucial if human-to-human
  asymptomatic transmission happens. Clinical diagnosis based on symptoms is inefficient in that case,
  while Yelin et al. (2020) lament that focusing tests on acutely ill patients leave potentially infectious
  carriers undiagnosed at the community 2. Testing of asymptomatic people is also useful if the disease
  has long-lasting consequences even without symptoms or if subsequent phases induce a higher fatality
  rate. Chan, Yuan, Kok et al. (2020) and Zhou, Li, Li and Zhang (2020) find ground-glass opacities for the
  vast majority of COVID19 asymptomatic patients; although further research may be needed on that
  point, this may signal potential sequelae even for asymptomatic patients.
  More or less stringent definitions of asymptomatic carriers exist. Zhou, Li, Li and Zhang (2020)
  document the existence of both presymptomatic and truly asymptomatic carriers. In order to tackle
  the contamination induced by the former, one could consider implementing trace and track, at least if
  the presymptomatic contagious period is short. However, as noted already, tracking teams may soon
  be overwhelmed. Thus, massive and timely identification of presymptomatic carriers may be
  necessary. More generally, I follow Harpedanne (2020) and use “asymptomatic” transmission to cover
  the transmission of a disease by asymptomatic but also presymptomatic, subclinical, or only mildly sick
  patients. Post-symptomatic patients may also present viral load, but these patients cause less
  problems for disease transmission since they can be isolated easily.
  First, many studies document the existence of asymptomatic carriers. In a meta-analysis of 66 articles
  and pre-prints, Koh, Naing, Rozledzana et al. (2020) find average asymptomatic proportion at diagnosis
  of 25.9%, including two thirds of presymptomatic and one third of truly asymptomatic. Among other
  studies, Zhou, Li, Li and Zhang (2020) document a low proportion of asymptomatic carriers (4%),
  probably due to sample selection issues (virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients in Shanghai Public
  Health Centre). Kimball et al. (2020) find 13% asymptomatic carriers and 43% presymptomatic;
  Mizumoto et al. (2020) find 18% asymptomatic carriers; Qiu et al. (2020) find 28%, Nishiura, Kobayashi,
  Suzuki et al. (2020) find 31%, and Day (2020) cites China National Health Commission pointing to 78%
  asymptomatic carriers in new cases observed over 24 hours to April 1, 2020.
  Second, Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 was early documented by Xu et al.
  (2020), Li, Guan et al. (2020), Chan, Yuan, Kok et al. (2020) and Phan et al. (2020). More specifically,
  biological and epidemiologic evidence for asymptomatic transmission is provided by Bai et al. (2020),
  2
    Massive and repeated testing of asymptomatic people may also be considered when no direct human-to-human
  transmission occurs. For instance, malaria -one of the most severe issues in public health in many countries in
  “normal” times- is mostly mosquito-borne, but mosquitoes are infected by biting infected humans, who are
  reservoirs of malaria (more specifically, humans may be reservoirs of malaria for Plasmodium falciparum,
  Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae).
                                                                   2

                                                      Harpedanne - Group Testing with Homophily - October 9, 2020
  Rothe et al. (2020), Zou et al. (2020), Santarpia et al. (2020)3, while Wong, Aziz, Chaw, Mahamud,
  Griffith Ying-Ru et al. (2020) strengthen the evidence for both asymptomatic and presymptomatic
  transmission. Koh, Naing, Rozledzana et al. (2020) find that the risk of transmission is 2.55 higher when
  the index case is symptomatic. Li, Pei et al. (2020) find that although the transmission rate of
  undocumented carriers is only 55% that of documented carriers, the former are responsible for 80%
  of contaminations, due to their high absolute numbers. Thus, massive testing of asymptomatic people
  has gained popularity during the epidemic (Allen, Block, Cohen et al., 2020, Lakdawalla et al., 2020).
  However, individual testing of asymptomatic people is hopeless. For instance, France (the sixth largest
  world economy, with a population of 67 millions) has reached 1.19 million COVID-19 tests per week as
  of September 2020. Even in the unlikely case in which all these tests would be dedicated to detect
  asymptomatic carriers, each person would be tested less than once a year.
  Group testing (batching the samples of different people and implementing a single test on the pooled
  sample), first proposed by Dorfman (1943), makes asymptomatic testing much more efficient.
  According to Mutesa (2020), when the prevalence of COVID-19 is .1 percent, the Dorfman’s design
  decreases 17-fold the number of tests required to identify asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers (0.06 test
  per person) while a new strategy suggested by Mutesa et al. decrease 55 times this number of tests
  (0.018 test per person). Still, the gains of group testing over individual testing are lower for higher
  prevalence, and there exist information-theoretic limits to the potential improvements allowed by
  group testing (see below Section 3).
  I examine the benefits of taking a priori information on interpersonal relations into account when
  designing the pools used for group testing. Considering this information (which I label “homophily”,
  see Section 2) makes it possible to push the information-theoretic limits mentioned above and improve
  test’s efficiency further. Also, group testing with homophily proves very efficient to tackle false
  negatives, a major deficiency of usual COVID19 RT-PCR tests based on nasopharyngeal swabs.
  Group testing is used to fight COVID19 in China, India, Germany, the United States (Mallapaty, 2020)
  and Rwanda (Mutesa et al., 2020). In the United States, it is authorized for pools of up to four people
  (Lakdawalla and Trish, 2020). The specific literature on group testing and COVID19 includes Gollier and
  Gossner (2020), Conger et al. (2020), Lakdawalla et al. (2020), Eberhardt, Breuckmann and Eberhardt
  (2020), Mutesa et al. (2020), Mallapaty (2020), Lohse et al. (2020) and Yelin et al. (2020).
  Group testing methods are either adaptive or non-adaptive. A group testing framework is adaptive if
  the results of a given round of test influence the design of subsequent rounds. For instance, Dorfman
  (1943) proposes a two-step procedure in which groups are tested in a first round, and if a group is
  positive, individual tests are implemented in this group. Mutesa et al. (2020, Section IV and Appendices
  B and C) discuss the pros and cons of various adaptive and non-adaptive tests to fight the COVID-19.
  Section 2 presents homophily and clustering as well as their links to contamination channels and
  contamination clusters; it shows that homophily can be identified ex ante, so that the strategy analyzed
  here, and especially in Section 5, is feasible. Then, Section 3 provides counterexamples to the limits
  computed by Chan et al. (2011) and Baldassini et al. (2013) and concludes that the homophily structure
  provides relevant information. Then, Section 4 shows that homophily makes it possible to reduce the
  effects of the dilution induced by group testing. Eventually, Section 5 considers false negatives induced
  by idiosyncratic noise: I find evidence that an adaptive strategy combining a first step group testing
  with homophily and a second step based on more advanced individual complementary exams can help
  identify asymptomatic carriers that could not be detected even by exhaustive individual tests. The
  appendix analyze the efficiency of this strategy to identify carriers at reduced cost and minimize the
  risk of false negatives.

    As regards other epidemics, Asymptomatic forms of SARS-CoV-1 are documented by Wilder-Smith et al. (2005),
  while asymptomatic transmission is documented for MERS (Omrani et al., 2013) and has induced long-lasting
  debates for influenza (Leung, Xu, Ip, and Cowlin,2015).

  Although many examples and references relate to the COVID19 epidemic, most results are
  mathematical or logical in nature and may be useful more generally during epidemics in which massive
  and repeated asymptomatic testing is necessary.
  2. Homophily, clustering, clusters, and contamination channels
  In this Section, I present homophily and clusitering, which are concepts used in social sciences, and
  clusters, which are used in epidemiology. I show that these concepts, that I summarize by “homophily”
  can be used ex ante to identify potential contamination structures in order to design testing pools
  accordingly, which is a necessary condition to implement the testing strategy analyzed in the rest of
  the present paper.
  Homophily was defined in 1954 by Lazarsfeld and Merton. It “refers to the fact that people are more
  prone to maintain relationships with people who are similar to themselves” (Jackson, 2008, p. 68).
  McPherson et al. (2003) document the prevalence of homophily in many social networks. Jackson and
  Lopez-Pintado (2013) analyze the effects of homophily on contagion. In particular, they show that
  starting from a small initial seed (a small number of infected people), homophily facilitates diffusion
  under rather limited conditions. Since homophily is prevalent in network analysis and relates to
  contagion, it makes sense to consider this phenomenon when designing testing strategies. Surprisingly
  enough, the literature on group testing has disregarded these aspects until now.
  A related econometric concept is clustering. Clustering refers to the nondeterministic correlation of
  outcomes between individuals that are somewhat related. Moulton (1986, 1990) introduced this idea
  and showed that failing to take it into account induce significant errors when estimating standard
  errors. Clustering has been popularized by Bertrand et al. (2004) who have shown that the standard
  errors of difference-in-difference estimates were not properly estimated when neglecting clustering.
  Clustering may be “multi-way” (Cameron, Gelbach and Miller, 2011), meaning for instance that an
  individual may be correlated with people working in the same firm on the one hand, with people living
  in the same village on the other hand, but also with people going to the same gym club, those having
  their children in the same school, etc, without these different clusters being nested.
  Nowadays, correcting for potential clustering is a condition sine qua non for scientific work in applied
  economics. Many results show that overlooking clustering would underestimate standard errors,
  which means that there exists a positive correlation between outcomes for individual belonging to
  groups identified ex ante on rather simple criteria. This pattern is verified for a wide range of outcomes
  in many settings.
  In other words, various branches of social sciences converge on both the necessity and the possibility
  of taking heterogeneous interpersonal interactions into account when analyzing many mechanisms,
  and contagion especially.
  The medical literature confirms that contamination occurs through clusters. Han and Yang (2020) cite
  a Chinese-written article asserting that “In some cities, cases involving cluster transmission accounted
  for 50% to 80% of all confirmed cases of COVID‐19.” The strategy analyzed in the present study requires
  to group together COVID cases in the same testing pool, or a few number of pools. Pools may include
  a few dozen individuals, at most one hundred (See Section 4 on dilution). Thus, it is needed to identify
  ex ante potential clusters of limited size. Madewell et al. (2020) report that “To better understand
  clustering within households, it would also be useful for researchers to report the number of infections
  by household in addition to the total number of infected individuals.” Unfortunately, this is rarely done,
  so that the feasibility of the strategy here analyzed must be evaluated indirectly. This can be done for
  instance by looking at studies on small clusters with high attack rate (ratio of contaminated people in
  a given group) or secondary attack rate (SAR is the number of people contaminated by an index case,
  divided by the people in contact with this index case).
  Koh, Naing, Rozledzana et al. (2020) provide a meta-analysis of 20 studies on secondary attack rate.
  Household is quite often the place where the SAR is highest (15.4% on average), and Qiu et al. (2020)
                                                                   4

  find that out of 36 children infected in a Chinese city, 32 (89%) had transmission by close contact with
  family members. But high SAR have also been observed in a chalet (73.3%), at a choir (53.3%) and at a
  religious event; high SARs are observed sometimes for travels and eating with an index case. Koh,
  Naing, Rozledzana et al. (2020) report other cases of clusters with very high attack rate: “a nursing
  home in Kings County, Washington (64%) […] a church in Arkansas (38%), a homeless shelter in Boston
  (36%), a fitness dance class (26.3%) and the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan (18.8%). Park et al.
  (2020) analyze an outbreak in a Korean building: 94 of 97 cases worked on the same floor (11th). 79
  cases worked in the same open-space (attack rate of 52%). Many clusters have also been observed in
  slaughterhouses. Thus, most of these results show high concentrations of cases in groups of limited
  size that can be tested in one or a few groups.
  Is it possible to derive from these results ex ante general contamination patterns in small clusters?
  Many studies (Li, Zhang, Lu et al., 2020, Madewell et al., 2020, Liu, Lian, Zhong et al.,2020) and the
  meta-analysis by Koh, Naing, Rozledzana et al. (2020) underline that longer and more intense exposure
  to infection sources increases the risk of infection. Crowded indoor environments with sustained close
  contact and conversations are a particularly high-risk setting (Nishiura, Oshitani, Kobayashi, et al.,
  2020). Interestingly, Park et al. (2020) find a high concentration of cases in open spaces but only one
  case in small offices. This is consistent with the theoretical analysis in Harpedanne de Belleville (2020)
  who shows an almost convex effect of the number of room users onto contamination.
  Using these general patterns and theoretical results, it is possible to identify ex ante potential clusters,
  and to design pools that encompass these clusters. Section 3 to 5 analyze the gains from this strategy.
  More generally, Harpedanne 2020) relates contamination channels and contamination probabilities
  between individuals who have interpersonal interactions. For instance, airborne and droplets
  contagions increase the probability of contagion between people sharing the same office, open space,
  corridor, etc. Contagion through fomites increase the probability of contagion between people using
  successively the same toilet, the same seat in a train coach, etc.
  Thus, like Harpedanne (2020), the present paper deals with curbing epidemics with asymptomatic
  contamination and heterogeneous social interactions inducing specific expected contamination
  patterns. For Harpedanne (2020), asymptomatic carriers are unidentified but organizational measures
  can affect interpersonal interactions; conversely, the present paper takes interpersonal interactions
  for granted and proposes to take them into account to better identify asymptomatic carriers.
  In Section 5, I analyze a two-step strategy in which the first step (pool test on nasopharyngeal swabs)
  draws on homophily to design test pools. From a policy perspective, many patterns of homophily and
  potential clusters are identified; they can be used to make testing more efficient and therefore reduce
  the need for unnecessary lockdowns (Piguillem and Shi, 2020). Still, households are documented as
  frequent clusters (high homophily inside households), and lockdowns may aggravate this fact. Thus,
  the two-step strategy can also be implemented to identify household contamination and make
  lockdowns more efficient and shorter.
  3. Using homophily to push information-theoretic limits
  In this section, I show that if the homophily structure is known before implementing a pooled test, it
  contains information that can make the test more efficient. For that purpose, I evidence that if
  homophily is “strong” enough and can be properly identified when designing the pooled tests - more
  specifically, when designing the pools -, it makes it possible to overcome the most recent and tight
  information-theoretic lower bounds on the efficiency of group testing. These limits have been
  identified by Chan et al. (2011) who, for the first time in the literature, define limits in terms of actual
  numbers and not only rate or capacity, and Baldassini et al. (2013), who follow the same path and
  provide a new and tighter lower bound.
  Unlike Sections 4 and 5, the present Section focuses on noiseless tests. Thus, a few definitions may be
  useful here. A group test is noiseless if a negative test outcome is guaranteed when all items in the
                                                                   5

  testing pool are nondefective, and a positive outcome when a least one item in the pool is defective
  (Aldridge, Johnson and Scarlett, 2019). Otherwise, the test is noisy.
  Noisy tests are often examined under the assumptions of constant (Chan et al., 2011) or worst-case
  (Macula, 1997) noise. However, the results by Yelin et al. (2020) point instead to an increasing risk of
  false negatives when dilution increases, and the results by Yang, Yang, Shen et al. (2020), Wang, Xu,
  Gao et al. (2020) and Wang, Tan, Wang et al. (2020) point to patient-specific idiosyncratic noise. These
  two issues are analyzed in Sections 4 and 5, respectively, and I show that taking homophily into account
  brings specific gains. Conversely, the general form noise models (such as the symmetric error model,
  see e.g. Chan et al. , 2011, or the additive model, see e.g. Atia and Saligrama, 2012) are not relevant
  to analyze these forms of noises, so that there is no need to provide a general noisy-models analysis.
  I consider noiseless tests for different other reasons. First, this makes it clear that the benefits of taking
  homophily into account in group testing are not limited to noise-related issues. Second, it makes the
  comparison with the information-theoretic limit of Baldassini et al. (2013) easier.
  Baldassini et al. (2013, Section III) analyze a noiseless test in a population of size N, with K defectives
  (K is known for simplicity). They show that if the number of tests is limited to T, the probability of
  correct identification of the set of defectives is:
                                                                        2𝑇
  (1)                                                     𝑃(𝑠𝑢𝑐) ≤       𝐾
                                                                        𝐶𝑁
                       𝑁!
  where 𝐶𝑁𝐾 =                  .
                   𝐾!(𝑁−𝐾)!
  Let N be 64 and K be 8. Using 6 tests only (T=6), one can cut the population in 8 groups of 8 people
  each and determine which group contains carriers if only one group contains carriers (think of the 64
  population as a 4x4x4 cube and cut the cube in half in each dimension, that is implement 6 tests over
  32 people each). According to (1):
                                                                        26
  (2)                                                     𝑃(𝑠𝑢𝑐) ≤       8  ≈ 1.45 10−8
                                                                        𝐶64
  Let now introduce homophily. Homophily means that there exists high potential for contamination
  within each group, while the potential for intergroup contamination is low. Let assume that only one
  individual has imported the disease in the 64 population: this a decent assumption if the prevalence is
  low in the general population; this assumption may be verified with probability (1- ε1), and let ε2 be
  the probability that intergroup contamination has happened. Then with a probability higher than
  (1 - ε1)(1 - ε2), all 8 carriers are in the same group. For instance, if ε1=0.2 and ε2=.5, we get:
  (3)                                                          𝑃(𝑠𝑢𝑐) ≥ 0.4
  Which of course contradicts (2). Strong homophily provides information that makes it possible to
  overcome information-theoretic limits based on the implicit assumption of absence of homophily.
  The counterexample just provided is extreme and not very useful in practice; the aim of this example
  is merely to illustrate that the usual information-theoretic limits rely on an implicit homogeneity
  assumption. By taking homophily into account, we relax this assumption. More realistic adaptative
  frameworks may provide rather high probability of success with a limited number of test. Think of
  testing the 8 groups independently in a first step and testing individually all people in the first two
  groups that turn positive in the first step. With decent homophily, this strategy would likely provide a
  very good probability of success while (1) would give a bound equal to 0.3 %. Actually, (1) would not
  apply since the strategies examined by Baldassini et al. (2013) are only non-adaptative, but since the
  authors point to the limited gain in efficiency brought by adaptative designs, it is likely that gains from
  homophily could be formally proven for adaptative designs. This is beyond the scope of the present
  paper, and (3) suffices to prove that homophily, if identified ex ante when designing a group test, may
  provide relevant information.

  4. Correcting the dilution effect of group testing thanks to homophily
  Dilution is a crucial issue for group testing applied to disease detection. If a positive swab is pooled
  with many negative swabs, it may difficult to identify traces of the virus. Dilution is dealt with already
  in the seminal paper on group testing by Dorfman (1943) who tackles syphilis detection among young
  drafted Americans. Dorfman finds that “diagnostic tests for syphilis are extremely sensitive and will
  show positive results for even great dilution of antigen”. Still, dilution may be more of an issue for
  other diseases. Dilution has been examined in a group testing framework by Hwang (1976). Warasi et
  al. (2017) propose a parametric model to tackle dilution.
  A series of studies have examined dilution for RT-PCR test targeting genes of SARS-CoV-2. Lohse et al.
  (2020) target the E gene (envelop gene) and S gene (spike gene) of SARS-CoV-2 and show that it is
  possible to identify positive samples correctly, even when diluted 30-fold (that is, one positive swab
  pooled with 29 negatives swabs). Yelin et al. (2020) find that group testing can be implemented with
  up to 32 individuals per group with a rate of false negative of 10 % in the case of COVID19, which they
  claim is low when compared to other sources of noise. They also suggest that implementing additional
  amplification cycles would make it possible to implement group testing with up to 64 individuals per
  group. Accordingly, Mutesa et al. (2020) show that using a Ct-value of 40 makes it possible to detect
  positive swabs diluted up one hundred-fold. More precisely, they show that for tests targeting the N
  gene of SARS-CoV-2, the upper 95% bound is below 40 and for tests targeting the Orf1ab gene, the
  upper 90 % bound is below 40. Subsequently, they confirm these results with tests targeting the E and
  RdRp genes.
  If homophily is taken into account when designing the pools, it is rather likely that carriers will be
  concentrated in a few pools, and therefore that no single carrier will be isolated in a pool. If many
  carriers are concentrated in a pool, this counteracts the effects of dilution. For instance, if a pool with
  32 swabs contains 2 positive swabs, the dilution is 1/16, which is rather limited.
  In the present paper, I do not analyze further the interactions between homophily and dilution. Indeed,
  the available literature points to limited effect of dilution for COVID-19. Still, this issue remains open
  to further research.
  5. Group testing with homophily to detect individual false negatives
  Idiosyncratic noise in tests can occur for many different reasons: contamination of the samples, error
  or insufficient training of the person in charge of collecting the swabs, etc. I focus here on a type of
  noise that has been extensively documented by the literature on COVID19: the swabs used for tests
  may fail to contain viral loading for many disease carriers. To solve this issue, a strategy based on group
  testing with homophily can identify more asymptomatic carriers than group testing alone, but also
  more than exhaustive individual testing.
  Many methods can be used to identify SARS-CoV-2 carriers: clinical diagnosis, chest radiograph and
  CT-scan, fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy, RT-PCR on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, nasal
  swabs, pharyngeal swabs, feces, etc. By definition, clinical diagnosis does not work for asymptomatic
  carriers; chest radiograph and CT-scan are not available to implement massive identification of
  asymptomatic carriers; as underlined by Yang, Yang, Shen et al. (2020), collecting lower respiratory
  samples (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy) requires specific equipment
  and skilled operators, and can be painful; among upper respiratory samples, sputum is produced in
  only 28 % of COVID cases examined by Huang et al. (2020). Thus, only nasal swabs and pharyngeal
  swabs may be used for large scale asymptomatic testing.
  Yang, Yang, Shen et al. (2020) analyze four types of specimens (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasal
  swabs, pharyngeal swabs and sputum) from 213 confirmed COVID patients and find strong evidence
  of false negatives for individual tests based on nasal or pharyngeal swabs: the rate of positive is only
  50% to 73.3 % for nasal swabs; it is higher (72.1 % to 73.3 %) for the swabs collected over the first week
                                                                   7

  after the onset of the disease. The rate is even lower for the pharyngeal swabs: 11 % to 61.3 %; once
  again higher for the swabs collected over the first week (60 % to 61.3 %).
  Wang, Xu, Gao et al. (2020) analyze eight types of samples (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid,
  fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy, sputum, nasal swabs, pharyngeal swabs, feces, bood and urine). They
  also find a high rate for false negative for individual nasal swabs and even more for pharyngeal swabs.
  They also point the very poor performance of rRt-PCR tests based on blood and urine. Wang, Tan,
  Wang et al. (2020) compare the detection performance of individual nasopharyngeal and
  oropharyngeal swabs for 535 patients. They also find better results for the former, and find that using
  both tests increase detection slightly over nasopharyngeal alone, which confirms the existence for
  false negatives for both. Overall, nasal swabs, which are widely used for rRT-PCR identification of SARS-
  CoV-2 (Wang, Hu, Hu et al., 2020), display a significant rate of false negatives.
  Yang, Yang, Shen et al. (2020) underline cases in which all upper respiratory tests (or all upper
  respiratory tests over a given period) are negative for confirmed COVID-19 patients. This points to the
  fact that false negative results are related to specific individuals rather than mere technical errors.
  Group testing with homophily can be very beneficial here. Indeed, even if a carrier is “false negative”
  (meaning that there is no viral load in the sample collected for this individual), with homophily it is
  likely that other carriers belong to the same group/pool, so that the pooled test has more chances to
  turn positive4. If α is the proportion of false negatives in carriers and false negative individuals are i.i.d.
  in the population of carriers, the risk of missing the identification of a carrier is α for individual tests
  and for test with only one carrier in a pool, but it is α² if there are 2 carriers in the pool… and αn if there
  are n carriers. Since the literature shows that 0< α <1, we get αn< αn-1….< α ²< α: more carriers in a
  group increase the probability of a correct (positive) result at the group level.
  The multistage testing strategies usually considered in the group testing literature are clearly not
  optimal in the presence of individual false negatives: the last stage usually implemented is individual
  testing in positive groups, which would pick only part of the true positives in each group. But if groups
  are properly defined by taking homophily into account, carriers are likely to be concentrated in the
  positive groups. Thus, rather than implementing the same tests as in the first step, it makes sense to
  isolate and take care of all people in the positive groups and to implement advanced search onto them;
  for COVID-19: clinical diagnosis, chest radiograph or CTscan, fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy, and rRT-
  PCR on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum if available and feces (this choice of samples for rRT-PCR
  is based on Wang, Xu, Gao et al., 2020).
  In this multistage strategy, two “costs” depend on homophility. First, even if this strategy is more
  efficient at tackling false negatives and identifying carriers than existing testing strategies, missed
  carriers happen. Second, if carriers are identified but are not concentrated, many pools must undergo
  the costly second-step process.
  Graph 1 analyze the quantitative gains from homophily in the two-step strategy described above, for
  an absolute number of defectives ranging from 2 to 5. This covers a large range of different situations.
  For instance, two defectives in a population of two thousand correspond to a rate of 0.1%, while five
  in a population of 50 correspond to a rate of 10%. The size (and number) of pools do not affect the
  graphs, so that the graphs also covers a large range of pool size. From left to right, each graph provides
  statistics (described below) for increasing concentration of the defectives in a few testing pools.
  As in Section 3, K is the number of defective. α is the probability that a test result is a false negative.
  According to Wang, Xu, Gao et al. (2020), RT-PCR on nasal swabs identifies 63% of carriers (72% to 74%
  for swabs collected over the first two weeks after onset for Yang, Yang, Shen et al., 2020). Thus, realistic
  figures for α range from 0.25 to 0.5, with an average value close to 0.33. I provide results for these
  three values. For instance, in the upper graphs (2 defectives), the left case (1 1) corresponds to one
  defective in a pool and one in another, while the right case (2) corresponds to the two defectives in
  4
    For the sake of simplicity, I neglect dilution. This is valid under mild conditions, including a limited pool size.

  the same pool. Increasing concentration can be denoted by the operator <C. <C is transitive but is not
  a total order, and using brackets ≈ for configurations that cannot be ordered through <C, we obtain,
  for 5 defectives: (1 1 1 1 1) <C (2 1 1 1) <C (2 1 1) ≈ (3 1 1) <C (3 2) ≈ (4 1) <C (5).
  The bars describe the expected number of missed carriers due to false negatives. When carriers are
  concentrated in a few pools or a single pool (on the right of each graph), they are detected more easily
  and the expected number of missed carriers decreases. Let consider for instance the case with exactly
  5 carriers. If homophily was disregarded when designing the pools and carriers are distributed i.id. in
  the pools, it is likely that five groups contain each 1 carrier (1 1 1 1 1) or one group will contain 2
  carriers and 3 groups will each contain 1 (2 1 1 1). Conversely, if homophily was taken into account,
  carriers are likely to be concentrated in a few groups. For instance, we note (3 2) the case in which one
  group contain 3 carriers and another contains 2, and (5) the extreme case where one group contains
  all the carriers. In the latter case, the number of expected missed carrier may be infinitesimal.

                                                      Harpedanne - Group Testing with Homophily - October 9, 2020
  More generally, when homophily is better taken into account when designing the groups for first-stage
  testing, the “expected missed”, i.e. the expected number of carrier belongings to groups with false
  negative results, decreases. Even when the proportion of individual false negatives is rather high
  (α=.5), almost all carriers are expected to be identified when they are concentrated in, say, two of the
  pools, and the risk of missing altogether vanishes when they belong to the same pool.
  It is interesting to note than even without homophily, that is if carriers are i.i.d. in the different pools,
  it is rather likely that at least two carriers will be in the same pool, which will reduce the expected
  number of “missed” carriers. That is, group testing alone, without considering potential homophily,
  can help identify and isolate carriers who would be missed by exhaustive individual testing. To the best
  of my knowledge, this simple and striking result has been overlooked in the scientific and policy
  debates about group testing to fight epidemics. Given the documented high prevalence of individual
  false negatives for tests implemented all over the world to fight COVID-19, this fact alone may deserve
  careful consideration.
  As already noted, in the presence of individual false negatives, implementing the same (failing) tests
  over the final phase(s) of a group tests process is useless and individuals in positive groups may rather
  be isolated and submitted to medical examinations and tests based on more reliable samples.
  This process induces a second cost related to groups that are positive in the first step. Homophily is
  crucial here. If it is possible to assess ex ante the homophily structure of contamination and to take
  that information into account when designing the pools and thus to increase the concentration of
  carriers in a few pools, the expected number of contaminated groups, and therefore the expected
  number of positive groups (groups that are identified as contaminated by the first step) are reduced
  stringently. The absolute gains are especially high for low values of α, since for low α, most
  contaminated groups are identified correctly.
  In this framework, determining the optimal pool size is different from the usual optimization
  introduced by Dorfman (1943). Here, the optimal size increases as usual with the cost of missing a
  carrier, but also decreases with the cost of the second step.
  Conclusion
  The present paper shows that heterogeneous interpersonal interactions with more relations within
  specific groups - homophily - contain relevant information to help detect asymptomatic carriers of
  diseases such as COVID-19. Specifically, designing test pools that encompass potential small-scale
  clusters makes it possible to overcome information-theoretic limits on the minimal number of test
  required to identify all carriers with a given (non-one) probability even in a noiseless framework.
  Still, the practical benefits of considering homophily for group testing may be related to noise in tests.
  Indeed, homophily may help counteract the detrimental dilution effect of group testing, which exists
  for COVID-19. Above all, group testing makes it possible to identify asymptomatic carriers who would
  be missed even by exhaustive individual testings - a benefit apparently unnoticed in the group testing
  literature -; in this context homophily helps increase the identification power while reducing the costs
  of the second step which includes individual complementary examination and tests on people
  belonging to positive groups.
  From a policy perspective, homophily can be used to increase test efficiency and therefore to avoid
  unnecessary lockdowns. Conversely, since households are one of the main clusters, especially during
  lockdowns, a testing strategy based on homophily could prove very useful to identify household
  contamination and make a lockdown shorter and more efficient.
  The present paper illustrates the interest of analyzing social interactions and their group structure to
  design testing strategies. I hope this work will encourage more research on group testing, false
  negatives, and the structure on social relationships in order to curb the COVID-19 epidemic and other
                                                                   10

  epidemics with asymptomatic carriers. Madewell et al. (2020) suggest to report contaminations by
  households. More generally, the cluster structure of contamination should be reported whenever
  possible, the links with contamination channels should be established, and general patterns should be
  identified in order to better implement the strategy analyzed in the present study.
  The computations in the appendix are based on the simplifying assumption that the results of different
  tests for the same individual are uncorrelated, so that the probability of a false negative using different
  swabs is the product of the rate of false negatives for each type of swab. More work on the correlation
  of test results would be very useful to fine-tune this analysis.
  Also, the time dimension is not taken into account in the present document. Optimization tools could
  determine the optimal frequency together with other parameters (size of the pools, etc.), which is not
  the aim of the present analysis. Still, from the appendix, a first order requirement is that the test
  procedure be implemented at least every fortnight, and even weekly if CT-scan cannot be generalized
  for the second step, in order to fit the time profile of test positivity.
  The approach analyzed here cannot fight the COVID-19 epidemic alone, and should be implemented
  in combination with other methods (track and trace…). However, these other approaches, as well as
  more advanced testing methods recently proposed, cannot tackle false negatives specifically. Thus,
  the combination of group testing and homophily provides a unique opportunity to tackle this crucial
  issue to fight COVID19.

              Appendix: Efficiency of a multiple-step tests and exams strategy
             to identify asymptomatic carriers of COVID19 with false negatives
  As shown in Section 5, with false negatives, a test strategy with a first step based on RT-PCR test on
  nasopharyngeal swabs and a second step based on a series of complementary exams can identify
  asymptomatic carriers better than exhaustive individual RT-PCR tests on nasopharyngeal swabs if
  multiple carriers are in the same pool. In Section 5, I examine the capacity of such a strategy to identify
  groups of carriers and I show that taking homophily into account decreases both the risk of missing
  individual carriers and the number of people on whom the second step must be implemented.
  The present appendix does not tackle homophily and provides more technical details on the different
  steps of such a strategy, with the aim of identifying as many carriers as possible while reducing the
  costs as well as the sufferings, constraints and potential sequelae on tested people.
  1st step: group testing using nasopharyngeal swabs
  RT-PCR on nasal swabs identifies 63% of COVID-19 carriers only (Wang, Xu, Gao et al., 2020). The rate
  is higher for swabs collected over the first two weeks after the onset of the disease (Yang, Yang, Shen
  et al., 2020) but lower afterwards. Thus, one could consider using other swabs instead, or using a
  combination of different swabs and exams. CT-scan or chest radiographs are available in limited
  number and must be implemented individually. Thus, they are not suitable for group analysis which is
  the cornerstone of the first step. Furthermore, CT scans or radiographs may induce potential sequelae
  if implemented repeatedly over a long period.
  Fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy and RT-PCR on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid requires specific
  equipment and specifically trained operators to collect the swabs. Although the RT-PCR or biopsy could
  be grouped, swabs collection is an individual and lengthy process. Thus, it cannot be implemented
  repeatedly over the whole population. Furthermore, the collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is
  painful. The social acceptance of its large scale repeated collection is unlikely for COVID-19, which has
  a rather limited mortality rate.5
  2nd step: if a group is positive, then individual complementary exams on each group member
  The following table describes the steps (column 2). In column 3, I compute the cumulative probability
  of identification of a carrier, given the probabilities documented by Wang, Xu, Gao et al. (2020), under
  the simplifying assumption that the results of different types of individual tests or exams are
  independent for a given carrier. Wang, Xu, Gao et al. (2020) measure the probability of positive test
  for identified carriers for eight different types of swabs: sputum, nasal, (oro)phatyngeal,
  Fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy, Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, blood and feces. I
  In column 4, I compute the same cumulative probability given the probabilities documented by Yang,
  Yang, Shen et al. (2020) for swabs collected over the week following the onset of the disease for mild
  cases. Columns 5 and 6 provide the same computations for swabs collected 8 to 14 d.a.o, and after 15
  d.a.o, respectively, also for mild cases.
  The first step, based on nasal swabs, must be implemented at the very least every fortnight. Indeed,
  RT-PCR based on nasal swabs are efficient over the first two weeks after onset, so that a test
  implemented every fortnight is likely to identify asymptomatic carriers if they follow a pattern similar
  to mild cases. Conversely, the rate of false negatives soars afterwards. The efficiency of BALF is
  questionable for asymptomatic carriers. Thus, the second step should be based either on upper
  respiratory track swabs alone or on a combination with CT-scan or radiographs. If the latter are not
  widely available, it is crucial to implement complementary exams, and the whole procedure, weekly.
  5
    Whether sputum can be used in the first step instead of or together with nasal swab is on open question. In the
  second step (individual complementary exams), if the sputum test is negative, the individual undergoes
  additional exams which are likely discover the presence of the disease and may include painful bronchoalveolar
  lavage. Thus, cheating during the series of complementary exams is irrational.
                                                                   15

Computations of cumulative probability of identification are based on the assumption that the probabilities of identification at different steps are uncorrelated.
