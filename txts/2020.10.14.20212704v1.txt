          ABSTRACT
          Objectives: We compared physical activity levels before the outbreak and quarantine measures
          with COVID-19-associated hospitalization prevalence in surviving patients infected with SARS-
          CoV-2. Additionally, we investigated the association of physical activity levels with symptoms
          of the disease, length of hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation.
          Methods: Between June 2020 and August 2020, we invited Brazilian survivors and fully
          recovered patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to respond to an online questionnaire. We shared
          the electronic link to the questionnaire on the internet. In this cross-sectional study, we collected
          data about clinical outcomes (symptoms, medications, hospitalization, and length of hospital
          stay) and cofactors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, preexisting diseases, socioeconomic and
          educational, and physical activity levels using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire
          (IPAQ short version).
          Results: Out of 938 patients, 91 (9.7%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. In a univariate
          analysis, sex, age, and BMI were all associated with hospitalizations due to COVID-19. Men had
          a higher prevalence of hospitalization (66.6%, P=0.013). Patients older than 65 years, obese, and
          with preexisting disease had a higher prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. In a
          multivariate regression model, performance of at least 150 min/wk (moderate) and/or 75 min/wk
          (vigorous) physical activity was associated with a lower prevalence of hospitalizations after
          adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and preexisting diseases (PR=0.657; P=0.046).
          Conclusions: Sufficient physical activity levels are associated with a lower prevalence of
          COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Performing at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-
          intensity, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity physical activity reduces this prevalence by
          34.3%.

          INTRODUCTION
                    The new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible
          for COVID-19 disease, initially discovered in the city of Wuhan, China, in late December 2019.1
          In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared SARS-CoV-2 to be a
          worldwide pandemic. The virus quickly spread to several continents, and strongly impacting
          Brazil. This pandemic claimed numerous victims with millions of confirmed cases worldwide
          and thousands of deaths. In Brazil alone, to date, more than 4 million cases have been confirmed
          with approximately 144,000 deaths, and these numbers are increasing dramatically. The main
          symptoms of the disease are fever, cough, shortness of breath, anosmia, and fatigue.2 COVID-
          19-associated hospitalization is an alarming issue with a higher cumulative rate in people aged
          65 years and older 3 and with high public health care costs.
                    Because it is a new virus with such lethality, WHO and the governments of each country
          have adopted isolation and physical distancing as a preventive measure to contain the spread of
          the virus. So far, there are very few effective treatments, and vaccines are still being developed
          in ongoing clinical trials. Therefore, behavioral measures, such as personal hygiene, wearing
          masks, healthy nutrition, and physical activity, are potential strategies in preventing or mitigating
          the disease.4 5
                    It is well known that exercise training (a subtype of physical activity) improves immune
          system response, protecting against infections caused by intracellular microorganisms.6 For
          instance, regular exercise improves the pathogenic activity of tissue macrophages in parallel with
          an enhanced recirculation of immunoglobulins, anti-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophils, natural
          killer cells, cytotoxic T cells, and immature B cells, improving immune defense activity and
          healthy metabolism.6 Several studies suggest that being physically active could protect or
          minimize the effects of COVID-19 in humans.7-9 However, all of these studies have presented
          only physiological hypotheses that might explain such an association. Therefore, exercise

          training might be an important prevention strategy against SARS-CoV-2 and could play a key
          role in preventing hospitalizations and supporting faster recovery of infected patients.
                    The present study aimed to assess the association of physical activity before the
          pandemic and quarantine measures with the prevalence of hospitalizations in surviving patients
          infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Additionally, we investigated symptoms of the disease, length
          of hospital stay, and the use of mechanical ventilation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and
          the association with sufficient and insufficient physical activity. We hypothesized that physically
          active patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have a lower number of hospitalizations compared
          with patients with insufficient levels of physical activity.
          METHODS
          Study design
                    This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04396353), and its protocol has been
          published previously.10 This is a cross-sectional study comparing the physical activity levels
          before the pandemic and quarantine measures of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2. This study
          was approved by the local Human Subject Protection Committee at the Hospital das Clinicas da
          Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (CAPPesq 5044-20-073), and all
          participants provided an online written informed consent. We followed the STROBE statement
          checklist for cross-sectional studies.11
                    Between June 2020 and August 2020, we invited Brazilian survivors and fully recovered
          patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to respond to an online questionnaire. We disclosed the
          electronic link of the form across the country through social media, newscasts, hospitals, medical
          care providers, and disease control centers in some cities. The questionnaire included questions
          regarding clinical outcomes (symptoms, medications, hospitalization, length of hospital stay, and
          mechanical ventilation) and cofactors like age, sex, ethnicity, preexisting diseases,

          socioeconomic and educational status. The short version of the International Physical Activity
          Questionnaire (IPAQ)12 was used to collect data on physical activity levels before the outbreak
          and quarantine measures in surviving patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The complete
          electronic questionnaire can be assessed in the supplemental material.
                    The inclusion criteria were men and women who had recovered and were survivors of the
          disease. Also included were individuals of all ages, with or without symptoms; patients with
          disease confirmed by a quantitative PCR viral test (qPCR), blood test (serology), and a rapid
          antibody test with or without hospitalization (nursery, semi-intensive and intensive unit care) and
          discharged from the hospital. Those with or without drug treatment, and with any chronic
          disease, such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome,
          cancer, among others were also included. The exclusion criteria were illiterate patients who had
          difficulty filling out the electronic form and patients still hospitalized and with symptoms of
          COVID-19. In addition, after completing the form, some participants were excluded due to the
          quality control of the responses provided (see quality control below).
          Quality control criteria of the questionnaire responses
                    We collected a total of 1597 completed questionnaires, and all data were assessed to
          identify possible fraud and inappropriate responses. We identified 118 (7.4%) duplicate
          responses, which were excluded. One hundred and twenty-one (8.2%) participants were excluded
          because they answered that they did not have COVID-19 and did not perform any diagnostic
          tests. Additionally, 277 (18.7%) participants who declared that they had been infected with the
          SARS-CoV-2 (because they believed they were sick) but without any diagnostic test and with or
          without symptoms were also excluded. Finally, only 2 children under 10 years of age answered
          the questionnaire, and we decided to exclude them from the sample (Figure 1). After this first
          analysis of quality data responses, 1200 participants were selected.

                    The second part of the data quality control was to correlate the self-report of physical
          activity with the answers provided in the IPAQ questionnaire. In one part of the questionnaire,
          we asked how the participants declared themselves: “athlete,” “physically active,” or
          “sedentary.” These 3 categories were correlated with the amount of physical activity reported in
          the IPAQ questionnaire. For instance, if the participant declared him/herself as sedentary, but
          performed more than 150 minutes of physical activity per week, he/she was excluded. After this
          correlation, 938 (78.2%) were included in the final analysis (Figure 1).
                    The participants were subdivided into 2 categories according to IPAQ information:
          sufficient physical activity (“athlete” and “physically active” were pooled) and insufficient
          physical activity (“sedentary”). Sufficient physical activity was considered when the participant
          performed at least 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity and/or at least 75 minutes
          of vigorous physical activity.13 14 Insufficient physical activity was defined when the participants
          did not meet these recommendations. In addition, sedentary behavior was defined considering
          the number of hours per day spent sitting.15 The metabolic equivalent of task (MET) defined as
          the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest (equal to 3.5 mL/kg/min) was calculated to
          estimate the energy expenditure values.12 Within our sample, we also calculated the 25th
          percentile of physical activity time (100 minutes/week) and METs (11.2 METs/hour/week); both
          were used to estimate the primary and secondary outcomes.
                    Body mass index (BMI) was categorized as follows: underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal
          weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2), obesity I (30.0-34.9 kg/m2), obesity II
          (35.0-40.0 kg/m2), and obesity III (>40 kg/m2).
          Outcomes
                    The primary outcome of the study was to assess the number of hospitalizations among
          individuals with sufficient physical activity and insufficient physical activity who were infected

          with SARS-CoV-2. The secondary outcomes were to assess symptoms of the disease (such as
          fever, headaches and muscle aches, shortness of breath, cough, loss of taste or smell,
          fatigue/tiredness), length of hospital stay, and use of mechanical ventilation.
          Sample size
                    The sample size was calculated using the Epi-Info program, version 7.2.3.1, considering
          an infinite population, an unknown prevalence of 50%, a confidence level of 95%, a sampling
          error of 5%, and a delineation effect (deff) of 2 points. The minimum sample size was 768
          subjects. Considering possible dropouts and to control for confounding factors in multivariate
          analysis, 10% was added resulting in a sample of 850 patients.
                    For the comparison of physical activity groups between the diagnoses of having or not
          having COVID-19, the sample was calculated based on the comparison of proportions in the
          G*Power software, with 80% power, 5% significance level, degree of freedom equal to 2
          (following a 3x2 size table; 3=hospitalization [yes and no] and 2=physical activity [athlete,
          physically active, and sedentary]) and an effect size w of 0.1. The calculation of 964 subjects
          with the addition of 10% of losses resulted in 1061. To answer the proposed objectives, the
          calculation with the largest sample size was considered.
          Statistical analysis
                    The data analysis was performed using SPSS v.25 software. The distributions of the
          quantitative variables were verified by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Symmetric and
          asymmetric distribution variables are presented as mean and standard deviation or median and
          interquartile range (median [p25 to p75]), respectively.

                    Categorical variables are represented by absolute and relative frequency. The proportions
          of the variables were compared between the outcome (hospitalization: yes or no) using the chi-
          square test. When significant, post-hoc analysis was performed using Winpepi v.11.65 software.
                    The sample characterization variables were associated with physical activity levels by
          using the chi-square test. When significant, the analysis of adjusted standardized residues was
          used to identify local associations with values equal to or greater than 1.96.
                    The Poisson regression model was used to estimate crude and adjusted prevalence ratios
          (PR) and their respective 95% CI. The statistical significance of the PR was assessed using
          Wald's statistics. Crude analysis of the variables was performed between the outcomes. After
          that, important multivariate outcomes were included in the model.
                    Among patients who were hospitalized, the association between physical activity levels
          and clinical variables of hospitalization (such as symptoms, medications, and mechanical
          ventilation) was analyzed. The distributions of length of hospital stay between physical activity
          levels were compared using the Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis test with the Dunn post-hoc
          test.
          RESULTS
                    Of 938 patients, 91 (9.7%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. In a univariate analysis,
          sex, age, and BMI were associated with hospitalizations due to COVID-19. When degree of
          hospitalization was compared between men and women, men had a higher prevalence of
          hospitalization (66.6% [P=0.013]). Patients older than 65 years had 7 times the prevalence of
          hospitalization compared with adults aged 18-65 years (P<0.001). Patients with obesity I were
          hospitalized more than subjects with normal weight (P=0.003). When compared with eutrophic
          patients, those overweight and obese patients had a higher prevalence of hospitalization between
          83% and 166%. Preexisting disease (P=0.002), 3 or more symptoms (P<0.001), and using 2 or

          more medications (P<0.001) were also factors associated with a higher prevalence of
          hospitalization (Table 1).
                    All categories constructed from the IPAQ (time of physical activity in minutes per week
          or METs hour per week) were significant in comparison with the proportions of hospitalization
          (P<0.05). In a univariate analysis, patients with insufficient physical activity (mean = 62.3±86.0
          min/wk and median = 25.0 min/wk [0; 106]) had a higher degree of hospitalization compared
          with patients with sufficient physical activity (mean = 726.9±426.7 min/wk and median = 640.0
          min/wk [420; 925]). Those who were sufficiently active had a 37.6% lower prevalence of
          hospitalization due to COVID-19 (PR=0.624; P=0.018). Other variables of physical activity
          levels had a reduction in the crude prevalence of hospitalization between 35.4% (cutoff point of
          11.2 METs/h/wk) and 46.2% (performs 2 or more physical activities) (Table 2).
                    Table 3 shows the characteristics between sufficient and insufficient physical activity.
          Men (P=0.010), normal weight (P<0.001), White race (P=0.031), with more than 9 minimum
          wage (monthly salary) (P<0.001), without medications (P=0.003), and without preexisting
          diseases (P<0.001) were all associated with sufficient physical activity. On the other hand,
          women, obesity I, II, and III, non-White race, less than 3 minimum wages (monthly salary), 3 or
          more medications, and 1 or more preexisting disease were associated with insufficient physical
          activity.
                    Table 4 shows the multivariate regression model to predict the factors involved in the
          primary outcome. Model 1 (adjusted for age and sex) showed a significant association of lower
          prevalence of hospitalization in patients with sufficient physical activity for the 3 categories:
          >150 min/wk (moderate) and/or >75 min/wk (vigorous) (PR=0.602; P=0.009), ≥100 min/wk

          lower prevalence of hospitalizations in model 2 (adjusted for age, sex, and BMI, PR=0.642;
          P=0.028) and model 3 (adjusted for age, sex, and preexisting diseases, PR=0.657; P=0.046).
                    Tables S5 and S6 (supplemental materials) show the comparison among hospitalized
          patients regarding intubation, oxygen therapy, symptoms, and medications used. Notably, there
          were no significant differences between these clinical outcomes and physical activity levels.
          DISCUSSION
                    The present study aimed to assess the association of physical activity before the
          pandemic and quarantine measures with the prevalence of hospitalizations in surviving patients
          infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. The main finding is that sufficient physical activity as
          recommended by WHO14 16 decreases the prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalization.
          Interestingly, performing at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes a
          week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate-
          and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, is associated with a 34.3% lower prevalence of
          hospitalization due to COVID-19 (PR=0.657; P=0.046). However, physical activity has no
          additional protection among those patients who were hospitalized. There was no difference in the
          prevalence of intubation, oxygen therapy, symptoms, and length of hospital stay between
          physically active and inactive patients.
                    To date, Brazil has experienced mortality of approximately 3% (68.72 deaths/100,000
          population17), and COVID-19 has been associated with a higher incidence of hospitalizations 18.
          Approximately 8% of confirmed cases (more than 389,000 patients) required hospital care. This
          burden has a high public health impact with an estimated cost of US$ 13,000 for less severe
          patients and US$ 40,000 for more severe patients with ventilator support.19 Several studies have
          shown that obesity, preexisting diseases, and advanced age are important predictors of the

          severity of COVID-19.2 20 21 Our study extends the knowledge that physical activity is a marker
          of hospitalization prediction after adjusting for these cofactors.
                    In the present study, we observed the higher prevalence of hospitalization in older
          patients, which could be explained by the association of systemic inflammation (termed
          “inflammaging22”) in elderly people. Interestingly, exercise training attenuates aging biomarkers
          and modulates the redox balance.19 Master athletes have better redox balance and inflammatory
          status compared with middle age-matched controls.23 Thus, physical activity may be a strategy to
          prevent clinical severity in elderly persons with COVID-19.
                    Obesity has been associated with insufficient physical activity and sedentary behavior.24-
          27
             Indeed, we found a higher proportion of obese patients with insufficient physical activity.
          Inflammation has been described as a key mechanism in the worsening of COVID-19 in the
          obese.28 29 Interestingly, physical activity is recommended as part of weight loss for obese adults
          (Evidence Category A).25 30 31 In addition, physical activity is one of the nonpharmacological
          therapies to reduce inflammatory cytokines,32 which may be a possible mechanism of protection
          in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. It has been suggested that central obesity compromises
          lung ventilation and may exacerbate COVID-19.33 Increased abdominal obesity34 and obstructive
          sleep apnea35 are common conditions in obesity, and both are remarkably improved after an
          exercise training program.25 30
                    Physical activity improves the immune system response mainly due to the amelioration of
          recirculation of immunoglobulins, neutrophils, natural killer cells, cytotoxic T cells, and
          immature B cells.6 Additionally, exercise prevents and treats numerous COVID-19-associated
          complications, such as cardiac, neurological, and metabolic disorders,27 36 including the positive
          effect on the renin-angiotensin system.37-39 Future studies are needed to better understand the
          mechanisms involved in physical activity and its benefits in patients with COVID-19.

          STUDY LIMITATIONS
                    This is an observational study and the results should be interpreted with caution.
          Although we found an association between physical activity and lower prevalence of COVID-
          19-related hospitalizations, we did not investigate the mechanisms involved in this relationship.
          All participants filled out the electronic form by themselves and possible bias should be
          considered. However, we constructed a quality control criterion to reduce such biases. We did
          not directly measure physical activity by an accelerometer device; however, self-report physical
          activity questionnaires have been largely used in research, and a systematic review shows that
          the IPAQ short form has excellent test–retest reliability (r=0.91).40
          CONCLUSION
                    Sufficient physical activity is associated with a lower prevalence of COVID-19-related
          hospitalizations. Performing at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes a
          week of vigorous-intensity physical activity reduces this prevalence by 34.3%. Public policies
          should encourage regular physical exercise to prevent complications from COVID-19.
          WHAT ARE THE NEW FINDINGS?
               •    Performing at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes a week of
                    vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate-
                    and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, is associated with a 34.3% lower prevalence of
                    hospitalization due to COVID-19.
          HOW MIGHT IT IMPACT ON CLINICAL PRACTICE IN THE FUTURE?
               •    To date, there are very few effective treatments against SARS-CoV-2 and vaccines are
                    still being developed in ongoing clinical trials.

               •    Physical activity is an important prevention strategy against SARS-CoV-2 and can play a
                    key role in preventing hospitalizations. Public policies should encourage regular physical
                    exercise to prevent complications from COVID-19.
