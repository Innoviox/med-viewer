          ABSTRACT
          Objectives: This is the first systematic review to look at all published data on EHRs to
          determine which systems are advantageous.
          Design: A systematic review was performed by searching EMBASE and Ovid MEDLINE
          between 1974 and November 2019.
          Participants: All original studies that appraised EHR systems were included.
          Main outcome measures: EHR system comparison, implementation, user satisfaction,
          efficiency and performance, documentation, and research and development.
          Results: The search strategy identified 701 studies, which were filtered down to 46 relevant
          studies. Level of evidence ranged from 1 to 4 according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-
          based Medicine. The majority of the studies were performed in the USA (n = 44). N=6
          studies compared more than one EHR, and Epic followed by Cerner were the most
          favourable through direct comparison. N=17 studies evaluated implementation which
          highlighted that it was challenging, and productivity dipped in the early phase. N=5 studies
          reflected on user satisfaction, with women demonstrating higher satisfaction than men.
          Efficiency and performance issues were the driving force behind user dissatisfaction. N=26
          studies addressed efficiency and performance, which improved with long-term use and
          familiarity. N=18 studies considered documentation and showed that EHRs had a positive
          impact with basic and speciality tasks. N=29 studies assessed research and development
          which revealed vast capabilities and positive implications.

          Conclusion: Epic is the most studied EHR system and the most commonly used vendor on
          the market. There is limited comparative data between EHR vendors, so it is difficult to
          assess which is the most advantageous system.

          INTRODUCTION
          An Electronic Health Record (EHR) is an electronic version of a patients medical history,
          that is maintained by the provider over time, and may include all of the key administrative
          clinical data relevant to that person’s care.[1] Several sectors of the UK’s health system use
          EHRs to a varying degree. These include National Health Service (NHS) hospitals, primary
          care (general practice) and social care services. In the UK, the NHS 5-year forward plan
          outlined its desire to cut the use of paper records and go fully digital. NHS England intends to
          connect EHRs across primary, secondary and social care by 2020.[2] There are several
          challenges to implementing EHR systems across the NHS. These include interoperability of
          information technology systems, system installation and staff training, opportunities for
          patient access, consequences for the Doctor-Patient relationship, and data security and
          privacy.[3] Currently, the majority of software for Summary Care Records (SCR), which is
          an electronic record of important patient information, are created for General Practice (GP)
          medical records. They can be seen and used by authorised staff in other areas of the health
          and social care system involved in the patient's direct care. Egton Medical Information
          Systems (EMIS), TPP and inPractice provide SCRs. Large suppliers of hospital software
          include Cerner, Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), British Telecom (BT) and IMS
          Maxims. Open Source software, which is software with source code that anyone can inspect,
          modify, and enhance is also increasingly used, and has been endorsed by NHS England.[3]
          The objective of this review is to identify studies that compare EHRs; in terms of direct
          comparison           between        systems,      implementation,      documentation,            user satisfactions,
          performance/efficiency and, research and development.

          Study selection
          We included all original studies that compared more than one EHR system. We also included
          any study that looked at various aspects pertaining to EHR systems. These included studies
          that looked at implementation, user satisfaction, efficiency/performance, documentation, and
          research and development. Studies that mentioned EHR or any of the search criteria as a tool
          for data collection only were excluded. Abstract studies were excluded. Two authors (MA
          and VP) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles, and selected
          publications to be included in this review. The full texts of these publications were reviewed
          by the two authors, who then selected the relevant articles for inclusion in the review.
          Data extraction and quality assessment
          Two authors (MA and VP) independently extracted data from the full text, which included
          source of article, study design, study period, type of EHR System, system comparison,
          implementation, user satisfaction, efficiency and performance, documentation, and research
          and development. Study design and study quality was determined using the Oxford Centre
          for Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) study design and levels of evidence classification,
          respectively.[5, 6]

          Data synthesis and analysis
          The methodology of the included studies was heterogeneous; therefore, it was not possible to
          pool data to conduct statistical analysis.
          RESULTS
          Study selection
          701 potentially relevant articles were retrieved. Of these, 600 articles were excluded
          following title and abstract review. Of the remaining 101 articles, 54 studies were excluded
          because they were abstracts only. Of the remaining 47 studies one paper was excluded
          because the full paper was not in the English language. The remaining 46 studies were
          included in this review (Figure 1) (Table 1). The agreement for inclusion of the studies
          between the authors was satisfactory (κ = 0.89).
          Study characteristics
          The level of evidence ranged from levels 1 to 4 according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-
          based Medicine (Table 1).[6] The bulk of the studies were performed in the USA (n = 44),
          one study represented a collaborative between Brazil and the Netherlands (n = 1) and the
          other was a collaborative between Denmark and Norway (n = 1). The studies were published
          from 2007 until 2019, with the majority published in the last 3 years (i.e., between 2017 and
          2019, n = 30).
          System comparison:
          The following studies compared more than one EHR system in their study (n = 6). One study
          compared; Epic/ Cerner/ MEDITECH/ McKesson/ MEDHOST/ Healthland/                                         Allscripts/

          Other.[7] Another study looked at Epic/Epic/MDoffice/Nextgen/ Allscripts/ Medflow/
          GEHealthcare/            Cerner/       ManagementPlus/             MDIntellesys/          NexTech/     Compulink/
          ManagementPlus/ SRSoft/ Practice Fusion/ EyeMD/ Integrity Digital/ ModernizingMedicine/
          I MedicWare/ IOPracticeware/ Partners Healthcare.[8] There were also comparisons between
          Epic / MDIntelleSys [9], Epic / Cerner /Allscripts [10], Epic/ Cerner [11] and Cerner/
          sparrow.[12] Epic was the most favourable system when it came to direct comparison with
          other EHR systems. Cerner was in second contention; however, this data was limited in terms
          of number of studies and range of system functions compared. Based on the study by
          Holmgren et al. 2018, (USA), Epic was associated with significantly better performance on 5
          of the 6 criteria.[7] These criteria included the following; medication orders entered using
          computerized provider order entry, patient’s ability to View/Download/Transmit (VDT) their
          health information, VDT used, medication reconciliation, summary of care record provided
          and summary of care record sent electronically. In comparison Cerner was significantly
          positively associated with 3 of these criteria.
          Implementation:
          The following studies looked at various aspects of implementing an EHR system and its
          implications (n = 17).[13-28] There was a general consensus among the studies that
          implementation of EHR systems was challenging in the first instance. It required intense
          planning and support prior to and during the implementation phase. Productivity also dipped
          in the early phase of implementation, but several studies showed that productivity improved
          soon after to return to baseline or make further gains. McDowell et al. 2017, (USA) showed
          that operating room efficiency, as measured by turnover time of patients, decreased in the
          first five months post-implementation returning to baseline at six months.[13] Wu et al. 2017,
          (USA) showed that there was a significant increase in first person in Operating Room (OR)

          delay during the first month post-implementation.[22] This difference abated by the second
          month and becomes statistically indistinguishable from baseline by the fifth month. Read-
          Brown et al. 2013, (USA) showed a similar dip in performance for a similar duration of
          time.[25] It reported that intraoperative nursing documentation time significantly increased
          but returned to near-baseline levels within 3 months. Johnson et al. 2018, (USA) reported that
          it took 30 months of planning to go live to an epic platform where 17,000 employees were
          affected by the switch.[29] A study that looked at the UK and Denmark’s implementation
          experience reported that it took Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 18
          months from signing its contract with Epic to going live,[14] while in Denmark where the
          contract with Epic was signed in 2013, the first implementation began in 2016 with the last of
          the hospitals making the switch in 2017.
          User satisfaction:
          Of the 5 studies (n=5) that evaluated user satisfaction, they all related to Epic [10, 18, 30-32]
          except for one that also examined Cerner and Allscripts.[10] There were mixed reviews when
          it came to user satisfaction. Issues with efficiency and performance was the driving force
          behind user dissatisfaction with EHR usage overall. Kamil et al. 2018, (USA) showed that
          only 37.8% (n = 48) of respondents reported they were somewhat or very satisfied with the
          EHR while 40.9% (n = 52) of respondents reported they were somewhat or very dissatisfied
          with the EHR.[10] The five most frequently cited challenges were excessive time burden (n =
          36, 28.3%), increased work associated with regulatory compliance (n = 17, 13.4%), the
          cumbersome, poor design of the EHR (n = 16, 12.6%), the lack of neurotology-specific
          customization of the EHR (n = 15, 11.8%), and the focus away from patients (n = 14, 9.55%).
          Makam et al. 2014, (USA) reported that providers expressed concerns about the impact of the
          EHR on in-person communication with patients.[32] Nearly two-thirds (62%) agreed that the

          EHR made it difficult to maintain eye contact with their patients, and 40% thought it
          interfered with provider–patient communication during visits. There was also an interesting
          gender difference when it came to EHR user satisfaction. The study by Khairat et al. 2019,
          (USA)[31] showed that men had a higher perceived EHR workload stress compared with
          women (p < 0.001). Men reported significantly higher levels of frustration with the EHR
          compared with women (p < 0.001). Women reported significantly higher satisfaction with the
          ease of use of the EHR interface than men (p = 0.03), and women’s perceived overall
          usability of the EHR is marginally higher than that of the men (p = 0.06).
          Efficiency and performance:
          EHR efficiency and performance was the most studied aspect (n =26).[7, 9-13, 15-18, 20-26,
          31-37] Long-term use and familiarity with the EHR system helped to improve efficiency.
          However, the overall review was poor in terms of efficiency and performance with the most
          commonly cited issues relating to the time taken to complete tasks. This was particularly
          challenging for those new to EHR and required extra time outside of normal working hours
          spent on completing various tasks. Kamil et al. 2018, (USA) showed that a majority of
          responders (n = 84, 66.1%) reported significantly or mildly decreased efficiency.[10]
          Makam et al. 2014, (USA) showed that each 5-year decrease in the number of years since
          graduation was associated with a 16% increase in the odds of agreeing that EHR was easy to
          use; a 15% increase in the odds of agreeing the EHR was easy to learn; a 25% increase in the
          odds of agreeing the EHR improved clinical workflow; a 27% increase in the odds of
          agreeing that they like to discover new ways to use the EHR; and a 12% increase in the odds
          of agreeing that EHR helps them be more thorough.[30]
          Documentation:

          The following studies looked at documentation using EHR (n=18).[7, 11, 12, 15, 18, 23-26,
          30, 31, 35-39] Studies showed that documentation with EHR had a positive impact,
          especially with basic tasks. Its improved productivity, when tailored to specific speciality
          requirement, allowed a more streamline experience. It also allowed for errors to be picked up
          and addressed in a more effective manner. Finn et al. 2017, (USA) showed that
          implementation of Epic Beacon for documentation allowed for identification of over 500%
          more chemotherapy order errors (41 total errors identified pre-Beacon versus 250 total errors
          identified post-Beacon).[23] Makam, et al. 2014, (USA) showed that most thought the EHR
          had a positive impact on routine tasks, such as prescription refills (94%), whereas fewer
          agreed when it came to complex tasks, such as the delivery of guideline-concordant care for
          chronic illnesses (51%).[30]
          Research and development:
          The following studies looked at using EHR in research (n=14)[9, 16, 27, 40-50] and
          development (n= 15).[20, 28, 31, 38, 40-43, 45, 47-52] Several studies looking at EHR in
          research showed its vast capabilities and positive implications. There is huge potential to
          using EHR for collecting large volume of data efficiently and streamline patient information
          at the port of entry to alert for specific concerns. Development with third party software and
          gadgets is also being looked at, although this is an emerging market that should allow
          patients more freedom to review and input their health data. Hayek et al. 2014, (USA)
          implemented a reminder system consisting of the addition of ‘‘Advanced Directives
          Counselling’’ to the problem list of EHR, and they managed to increase advance directive
          documentation to 76% compared to 11.5% without the reminder prompting.[38] Queiroz et
          al. 2019, (Brazil/Netherlands) used automatization of data collection for clinical research

          using EHR and demonstrated that 76.5% to 100% of accurate data can be obtained from this
          setup.[41]
          DISCUSSION
          This is the first systematic review to compare different EHR systems. What becomes evident
          is there are limited studies conducted outside of the USA on the subject, where the leading
          market share is held by Epic. Epic was the most studied EHR system and studies pertaining
          to Epic have looked at all aspects of the system from implementation to research and
          development. Switching to an EHR system is no easy venture, a huge amount of planning and
          recourses are required. An overall dip in performance is expected to come with the immediate
          transition. Intensive support across the board especially from the information technology
          teams is crucial. Documentation with EHR improves efficiency however becoming proficient
          at using EHR has its drawbacks and limitations. Certain EHR systems (Epic followed by
          Cerner) are better at this than others, although the numbers of studies looking at direct system
          comparisons are limited. EHR use in research has a lot of potential and development of
          software to enable patient-centred care is on the horizon with improvement in technology.
          There is little doubt that a gold standard EHR system would be challenging to achieve as
          evident by the efficiency and performance studies. There are several different user groups
          (doctors, nurses, ward clerks, administrators, etc.), in different settings (Accident and
          Emergency, speciality wards, operating theatres, outpatient clinics, etc.) using the same
          system. However, an ideal system (Figure 2) should have, maximum IT support pre- and
          during its implementation phase. Continued training should be offered and along with a
          feedback platform for improvements. Training should start early at either medical school or

          nursing school and implemented into teaching syllabuses. This will allow for more effective
          transition into working life for healthcare professionals. Routine tasks such as requesting
          scans should not be taxing or complicated with multiple steps. Flexibility in the layout and
          templates to allow for diversity of use is essential across the different settings. Automatic
          populating of data should be offered to help expedite tasks sue as discharge summaries or on
          templates to be used when alerting against potential adverse events.
          In terms of the strengths of this study, most of the studies were conducted in well-respected
          and known centres in the USA. They are also very current, and most were published in the
          last 3 years.
          Most of the results of the studies came from one EHR system Epic, which can be seen as one
          of the limitations of this study. In addition, meta-analysis could not be performed due to the
          heterogeneity of the studies. This study clearly highlights the lack of comparison between
          EHR systems and the monopoly that Epic may hold across the USA. There was very limited
          data with regard to cost implications, which is a very important matter in today’s NHS. Other
          relevant aspects such as medicolegal implications, were barely touched on by one study in its
          survey findings, but not elaborated on this any further.[10] While effectiveness in clinical
          governance was not considered by any of the studies. More research and studies are required
          from UK-based hospitals on systems commonly used in the UK.

          Epic was the most studied EHR system and the most commonly used vendor on the market.
          There is limited comparative data between EHR systems and therefore it is difficult to assess
          which is the most advantageous system currently available.
