                  A Mathematical Model and Optimal Control for
                  Listeriosis Disease from Ready-to-Eat Food Products
                              Abstract: Ready-to-eat food (RTE) are foods that are intended by the producers
                              for direct human consumption without the need for further preparation. The
                              primary source of human Listeriosis is mainly through ingestion of contaminated
                              RTE food products. Thus, implementing control strategies for Listeriosis
                              infectious disease is vital for its management and eradication. In the present study,
                              a deterministic model of Listeriosis disease transmission dynamics with control
                              measures was analyzed. We assumed that humans are infected with Listeriosis
                              either through ingestion of contaminated food products or directly with Listeria
                              Monocytogenes in their environment. Equilibrium points of the model in the
                              absence of control measures were determined, and their local asymptotic stability
                              established. We formulate an optimal control problem and analytically give
                              sufficient conditions for the optimality and the transversality conditions for the
                              model with controls. Numerical simulations of the optimal control strategies were
                              performed to illustrate the results. The numerical findings suggest that constant
                              implementation of the joint optimal control measures throughout the modelling
                              time will be more efficacious in controlling or reducing the Listeriosis disease.
                              The results of this study can be used as baseline measures in controlling Listeriosis
                              disease from ready-to-eat food products.

                  1 Introduction
                  Human Listeriosis is a zoonotic disease with a low incidence rate, but with a high mortality
                  rate of those sickened with the infection globally Bennion et al. (2008). The disease poses
                  a huge public health concern, and as a result there is need to develop strategies to combat
                  any outbreak of the disease. Humans are infected with Listeriosis through consumption
                  of Listeria contaminated food products or directly from the environment by acquiring the
                  pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), due to improper hygiene Hu et al.
                  (2016); WHO (2020). In order to diagnose human Listeriosis, the active bodies responsible
                  for food-borne diseases surveillance such as the National Institute of Communicable
                  Disease (NICD) South Africa, Center for Disease Control (CDC) USA, and World Health
                  Organization (WHO) obtain their results through laboratory-confirmed cases. Listeriosis
                  is usually diagnosed when a bacterial culture grows L. monocytogenes from body tissue
                  or fluid, such as blood, spinal fluid, or the placenta CDC (2020). The incubation period
                  is from 1 to 21 days, but in some patients it takes up to 90 days after the first exposure
                  to the bacteria before it is diagnosed CDC (2020). Symptoms of infection include: fever,
                  flu-like symptoms, nausea, diarrhoea, fatigue, headache, stiff neck, convulsion, loss of
                  balance, and muscle aches. Furthermore, in pregnant woman, it can cause miscarriages,
                  stillbirths, premature delivery, or life-threatening infections to the unborn babies. Human
                  Listeria infections can be treated with β-lactam antibiotic, normally ampicillin Almudena

                  and Payeras-Cifre (2014). However, upon any outbreak, some preventive measures such
                  as the recall of contaminated food products, factory workers practicing proper hygiene,
                  educational campaign programs can be implemented to control the disease.
                  Mathematical models improve our understanding of pathogen dynamics by providing a
                  theoretical framework in which factors affecting transmission and control of the pathogens
                  can be explicitly considered Lanzas et al. (2011). The purpose of modelling disease
                  epidemics is to provide a rational basis for policies designed to control the spread of disease
                  outbreaks. This includes practical optimal strategies in models that allow the assessment
                  of the interventions instituted by public health authorities. Optimal control is a powerful
                  mathematical tool in decision making which involves employing appropriate strategies to
                  eradicate epidemics from the population Makinde and Okosun (2011). These decisions
                  include; determining the proportion of the population that should be treated as time evolves
                  in any given epidemic in order to minimize both the number of infections in the population
                  and the cost of the treatment strategy implementation Omondi et al. (2018).
                  Recently, mathematical models have been used to study the transmission dynamics of
                  Listeriosis (see for example Stout et al. (2020); Otoo et al. (2020); Osman et al. (2018);
                  Witbooi etal. (2020); Chukwu and Nyabadza (2020)). In particular, Otoo et al. (2020) studied
                  the optimal control of Listriosis with system of equations describing the disease transmission
                  in both human and animal populations. Further, none of these models considers the case
                  of optimal control strategies to control Listeriosis in the human population by ingestion
                  of contaminated ready-to-eat food products.The objective of this study is to develop and
                  analyse an optimal control model of Listeriosis foodborne disease (FBD) from contaminated
                  ready-to-eat food products. The optimal control strategies to be implemented are in the form
                  of recalls of contaminated foods products, boosting the immune system and educational
                  campaigns.
                  The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows; in the next section, we give the formulation
                  of the mathematical model, as well as the underlying assumptions. Section 3 presents the
                  model properties and analysis without controls. In Section 4, the definition of permissible
                  optimal controls is given with corresponding optimality system. Numerical simulation
                  results are presented in Section 5 and Section 6 concludes the study.
                  2 Mathematical Model
                  The mathematical model comprises of; the human population, manufactured food products,
                  and the bacteria (L. monocytogenes) population in the environment. The total human
                  population is divided into three standard epidemiological classes of susceptible S(t),
                  infected with L. monocytogenes I(t), and the recovered R(t), at any time t. The human
                  population thus follows the standard SIR model with the total human population N (t)
                  given by
                          N (t) = S(t) + I(t) + R(t).                                                             (1)
                  The susceptible humans grow at a rate proportional to the size of the human population,
                  µh N (t) with µh also the mortality rate of each of the human population. Susceptible humans
                  are infected by consuming contaminated food and by Listeria from the environment at a rate
                  Λh defined by Λh = ω1 Fc + ω2 Lm where ω1 and ω2 are the effective contact rates (i.e the

                  monocytogenes respectively. Upon infection, the susceptible humans become infectious and
                  join the compartment I. Once infected humans recover at a rate α and recovery is assumed
                  to be with temporary immunity. Thus, recovered humans become susceptible again at rate
                  ρh Swaminathan and Gerner-Smidt (2007). We let Lm represent L. monocytogenes with a
                  net growth rate rl , and a carrying capacity 0 ≤ κm ≤ 1. The bacteria is assumed to grow
                                           dLm                  Lm 
                  logistically so that           = rl Lm 1 −          . Food products are divided into two: we have
                                            dt                   κm
                  uncontaminated food products Fu and contaminated food products Fc , with the total food
                  products F = Fu + Fc . We assume a constant production rate µf of uncontaminated food
                  with the production assumed to produce uncontaminated food. Uncontaminated food is thus
                  contaminated at a rate Λf through bacteria from the environment and contaminated food in
                  the factory’s handling as distribution processes. Here, Λf = ω2 Lm + ω3 Fc with ω2 and ω3
                  been the effective contact rates of the bacteria and contaminations of uncontaminated food
                  caused contaminated food products respectively. All food products are subject to a removal
                  rate µf . We combine the model description, assumptions, model parameters, and Figure 1,
                  which yields the following system of equations:

                  for model equations (3) contained in R5+ . The positivity of the solutions is governed by the
                  following theorem.
                  Theorem
                               1: Model system (3) are contained in the region Ω ∈ R5+ , which is given by Ω =
                    (s, i, lm , fu , fc ) ∈ R5+ : 0 ≤ s + i ≤ 1, 0 ≤ lm ≤ 1, 0 ≤ fu + fc ≤ 1 , for the initial
                  conditions (4) in Ω.
                  : The total change in human population from the first and second equations of (3) is given
                  by the differential inequality;
                           dn
                               ≤ (µh + ρh )(1 − Φ0 ),                                                             (5)

                  for n = s + i ≤ 1, and setting Φ0 = s + i. The solution of (5) gives
                                                                           Φ0 (0) ,
                                                           Φ0 (t) = 1 −

                  with Φ0 (t) having an upper bound of 1 as lim n(t) given that Φ0 (0) ≤ 1. We consider the
                                                                     t→∞
                  bacteria population in the environment given by:
                          dlm
                                 = rl lm (1 − lm )                                                                (6)
                            dt
                  from the third equation of (3). Solving the first order equation (6) gives
                                                                           1        ,
                                                            lm (t) =
                                                                      1 + Φ1 e−rl t
                  where Φ1 is a constant. Hence 0 ≤ lm ≤ 1. The growth of L. monocytogene is thus
                  bounded. Research shows that it adapts in adverse conditions events at refrigeration
                  temperatures. This makes it easier for it to cause contamination of food products either in
                  the factory or vegetation, there by causing Listeriosis in the human population via ingestion
                  of contaminated foods, mostly ready-to-eat foods. Also, the total change in amount of
                  manufactured food products from the fourth and fifth equation of (3) is given by
                                                               df
                                                                   = µf (1 − f ),
                                                               dt
                  whose solution is given by
                                                                            Φ2
                                                              f (t) = 1 −         ,
                                                                          e(µf )t
                  where Φ2 is a constant. We note that lim f (t) → 1. Hence, solutions of model equations
                                                                 t→∞
                  (3) exists, and are biologically meaningful, bounded, and remains in Ω for t > ∞. We apply
                  Theorem 2 to show, that model system (3) has non-negative solutions. We state the theorem
                  as follows
                  Theorem 2: For each non-negative initial conditions (4), the solutions of model equations
                  (3), (s(t), i(t), lm (t), fu (t), fc (t)) are all non-negative for t ≥ 0.

                  From the first equation of the system (3), we have the differential inequality
                                                         ds                           

                  We note that lim inf (sh (t)) ≥ 0, where s(0) > 0 is the given initial condition for the
                                      t→∞
                  susceptible population. Hence, the solution of s(t) remains non-negative for all t ≥ 0.
                  Similarly, the second equation of system (3) gives
                                                              di

                                                                           

                  Similarly, it can be shown that the remaining equations of model system (3) are non-negative,
                  that is; lm (t) > 0, fu (t) > 0, and fc (t) > 0 as t tends to infinity for all time t ≥ 0. Hence,
                  the solutions of (3) are non-negative for all t ≥ 0.                                                

                  To solve for the steady states of model equation (3), we equate the right hand side to zeros
                  as follows and obtain;

                                                      (ω2 lm  + ω3 fc∗ )fu∗ − µf fc∗ = 0.                          (11)

                  From equation (9) we have that lm0             = 0 or lm1        = 1. Note that, lm represents lm . If
                   ∗                                  ∗
                  lm0 = 0, then we solve for fu from equation (10) and obtain

                          fu∗ =                 ·                                                                  (12)
                                  µf + ω3 fc∗
                  We substitute equation (12) into equation (11) and obtain
                          ω3 µf fc∗ − µf fc∗ (ω2 fc∗ + µf ) = 0,                                                   (13)
                  after some algebraic manipulations. Further simplifications of the expression (13) yields

                  Remark 1 However, we note that                 is the duration contaminated food stays contaminated.
                                                             µf
                  Rf denotes the food contamination threshold. The dimensionless quantity Rf is the
                  contamination of food products caused by the bacteria (Listeria), and the contaminated food
                  (fc ) during the process of food manufacturing or food preparation. Rf connotes the basic
                  reproduction number R0 in infectious disease modeling as defined in Van den Driessche
                  and Watmough (2002). Without loss of generality, this represents the average amount of
                  food products that can be contaminated, and thus responsible for causing human Listeria
                  infections.
                  We have the following result on the existence of the steady state fc∗1 .
                                                          ∗
                  Lemma 3: The steady state fc1              exists subject to the existence of Rf > 1.
                             ∗
                  Thus, if lm0    = 0, then fc∗0 = 0 which results to Λ̃h = Λ̃f = 0, fu∗ = 1, i∗ = 0, and s∗u = 1.
                  Hence we have the disease-free steady state (DFS) denoted by

                  3.2.1 Local stability of E∗
                  Theorem 4: The DFS of model system (3) is locally asymptotically stable whenever rl < 0
                  and Rf < 1, and otherwise unstable.
                  : Evaluating the linearized matrix of model system (3) at E∗ , we have
                                                                                

                          J(E ) =       0        0         rl     0      0                                    (14)

                  where Q = −(ρh + µh ). Hence, the eigenvalues from (14) are given as: λ1 = −(ρh +
                  µh ), λ2 = −(µh + α), λ3 = −µf , λ4 = rl , and λ5 = µf (Rf − 1). Note that, if Rf < 1,
                  then λ5 < 0. However, if rl < 0, then all the eigenvalues at E∗ are negatives. Then E∗
                  is locally asymptotically stable. Furthermore, if rl > 0, then E∗ becomes unstable steady
                  state.                                                                                            
                  The biological significance of rl < 0 is that, there is decrease in the Listeria population
                  as the total Listeria population decreases towards its maximum limit, and thus we have a
                  logistic growth.

                  Also, if lm0    = 0, and fc1 = Ψ0 Rf − 1 , then substituting into (7)-(8) we obtain

                              A Mathematical Model and Optimal Control for Listeriosis Disease                      9
                  in which
                          ζ3 = (α + µh ) (µh + ρh ) + (α + µh + ρh ) ω1 Ψ0 (Rf − 1) ,
                          ζ4 = α + 2µh + ρh + ω1 Ψ0 (Rf − 1) .
                  The rest eigenvalues were found from J2 (E∗∗ ) given by the characteristic equation
                          Λ2 + ζ6 Λ + ζ5 = 0,                                                                   (19)
                  in which
                                  µf (µf (1 + Re (Rf − 1)) + Ψ1 ω3 ) ,             2µf (1 + Re (Rf − 1)) + Ψ1 ω3 ,
                          ζ5 =                                               ζ6 =
                                             1 + Re (Rf − 1)                              1 + Re (Rf − 1)
                  where
                                             Ψ1 = ((1 + Re (Rf − 1)) (Rf − 1) Ψ0 − 1) .
                  We have that ζ3 , ζ4 , ζ5 , and ζ6 are positive if Rf > 1. Hence, applying the Routh Hurwitz
                  stability conditions, we have that all their eigenvalues of quadratic equations (18), and (19)
                  have negative real parts. Thus, E∗∗ is locally asymptotically stable if and only if rl < 0, as
                  all the eigenvalues will be negative. Note that, if rl positive, we will have E∗∗ becoming an
                  unstable steady state otherwise.                                                                 
                  On the other hand, if lm1 = 1, in a similar approach we solve for fu from equation (10)
                  and obtain
                                           µf
                          fu∗ =                       ·                                                         (20)
                                  µf + ω2 + ω3 fc∗
                  Substituting (20) into equation (11) we obtain the quadratic equation
                          ζ2 fc∗2 + ζ1 fc∗ + ζ0 = 0,                                                            (21)
                                                                        1        
                  given that ζ0 = −ω2 πf < 0, ζ1 = ω2 πf −                    − 1 , ζ2 = ω3 πf > 0. We note that
                                                                          Rf
                  ζ1 > 0 if Rf > 1 and ζ1 < 0 if Rf < 1. thus irrespective of the sign of ζ1 , the solutions of
                  the quadratic equation (21) fc∗ will always have one positive root say f˜c∗ . The actual value
                  of fc∗ exists but cannot be determined due its intractability. Hence (7) and (8) becomes

                  that; there must be more contaminated food products than uncontaminated food products
                  for the Listeriosis outbreak to reach an endemic state; resulting in more humans being
                  infected with the disease. Hence, by the principle of Routh-Hurwitz stability condition, all
                  the eigenvalues of the quadratic equations (25) and (26) have negative parts.                    
                  3.3 Parameter Estimation and Sensitivity Analysis
                  This section is devoted to performing the sensitivity analysis of the model equations without
                  controls. But before the sensitivity analysis, we explain how the parameter values were
                  obtained. There are very limited resources of mathematical models and in literature based
                  on Listeriosis disease epidemics, as a result most of the parameters values used in this work
                  given in Table 1 were estimated except for the food product removal rate µf = 0.0099 which
                  is from Chukwu and Nyabadza (2020). We used the fourth order Runge-Kutta numerical
                  scheme in Matlab with a unit time step one (1) to carry out the simulations with the following
                  initial conditions; s(0) = 0.6, i(0) = 0.3, lm (0) = 0.1, fu = 0.7, fc = 0.3, which initial
                  conditions are chosen hypothetically for illustrative purposes and do not reflect real-life
                  applications. With no control, the food contamination number Rf is 1.5, thus, indicating
                  the disease-free equilibrium is unstable.

                  Next, we simulate model (7)-(11) using Latin Hypercube Sampling method in Blower and
                  Dowlatabadi (1994). This method allows us to determine which parameter of the model
                  are more or less sensitive, and hence determine the variability for the Listeriosis disease
                  epidemic to persist in the human population. Given the input parameters of model equations
                  (7)-(11), the uncertainty analysis gives the model parameter output with positive, and
                  negative partial correlation coefficients (PRCC’s) to the model system. We note that the
                  parameters with PRCC’s > 0 will have a positive impact and those with PRCC’S < 0 will
                  negatively impact on chosen model output. We have used a 1000 runs with a time step
                  Figure 2 Tornado plot showing PRCC’S of all the parameters of model system (7)-(11) which are
                              responsible for Listeriosis disease epidemics.
                  1 to carry out the sensitivity analysis. The Tonardo plot Figure 2 depicts all the model
                  parameters with their respective partial correlation coefficients. Figures 3(a) and 3(b), shows
                  the parameters ρh and α are strongly positively correlated and have positive PRCC’s to
                  the infected humans respectively, while the parameters are negatively correlated to infected
                  humans as depicted in Figures 3(c) and 3(d). The figures show the parameters ω1 , and
                  ω2 are negatively correlated with respect to the fraction of infected humans. This results
                  implies that; if we increase the rate of lose of immunity, fewer humans recover from Listeria
                  infections. On the other hand, increasing ω1 and ω2 will lead to more Listeria infection in
                  the human populations. Further, in Figure 2 we see that the removal rate of food products
                  µf has a positive PRCC’s,while the rate of contamination of uncontaminated food, ω3 , is
                  negatively correlated. This confirms the results depicted by the food contamination threshold
                  Rf obtained in Section 3.2. Hence, increase in µf decreases Rf and increase in ω3 increases
                  the Rf resulting in more human Listeriosis disease.

                  3.3.1 Varying Parameters ω1 and ω2 on the Fractions of Infected Humans
                  We carry out numerical simulations to support results obtained from the sensitivity analysis
                  of the model without controls by varying parameters ω1 and ω2 on the fractions of infected
                  humans. In Figure 4, we observe that an increase in the rate of at which humans are infected
                  by Listeriosis (ω1 ) and the rate of food contamination by Listeria, (ω2 ) results to more
                  fraction of infectious humans (see Figures 4(a) and 4(b)).
                  4 Optimal Control Problem
                  In this section, we apply optimal control theory to access the preventive measures so
                  as to reduce the spreading of the disease in a homogeneous population. Therefore, we
                  formulate an optimal control problem with the following permissible controls variables: u1 ,
                  depicting the effects of media campaigns in reducing infection; u2 , controls the recovery of
                  infected humans through the use of antibiotics; and u3 controls the removal of contaminated
                  food products through say, the recall of food products from the retail stores or factories.

                  5 Numerical Results
                  The numerical solutions to the optimality system given above carried out using the Forward-
                  Backward Sweep method Lenhart and Workman (2007) with accompanying parameter
                  values in Tables 1 and 2. We note that, this optimal control problem is a two-point
                  boundary-value problem with boundary conditions at time interval t0 = 0 and tf = 100.
                  The simulation is carried out for a maximum of 100 days even though the treatment of
                  Listeriosis disease is within 30 days. In order to solve the optimal control problem, we
                  applied Forward Runge Kutta order 4 numerical scheme to solve the model with control
                  equations (27) and a Backward Runge Kutta order 4 numerical scheme to solve the adjoint
                  equations given by (31). Next, we consider the permissible control values with an initial
                  guess and find the time varying control values with an input from the computed values of the
                  state and adjoint variables in the characterized optimal controls given by equations (34) and
                  (35)-(37). The controls are then updated through convex combination of the control values
                  in the previous iterations and the values from the characterized system (that means, taken the
                  average of both the new and old control values). Further, the convergence is acquired when
                  the values of the variables in the new iteration and the previous iteration are significantly
                  close. The process is repeated, and iteration is stopped when the values of unknowns at
                  the previous iteration are very close to those at the present iterations. However, for the
                  numerical result obtained here, we have also assumed that the estimated weight of the cost
                  media campaign, treatment and removal of food products are equal due to the type of disease
                  (Listeriosis epidemics) in consideration, and are indicated in Table 2. In these numerical
                  findings, we have considered combination of the following best effective possible control
                  strategies, which are: (i) Control strategy using media campaigns, treatment and removal
                  of food product; (ii) Control strategy using treatment only; (iii) Control strategy using
                  treatment and removal of food product only; (iv) Control strategy using media campaigns,
                  and removal of Food product only; and (v) Control strategy using media campaign and
                  treatment only.

                  5.1 Control Strategy Using Media campaigns, Treatment and Removal of Food
                         Product
                  In Figures 6(a) and 6(b) we observe that, in the presence of optimal control the fraction
                  of susceptible humans increases, while the fractions of infected humans reduces over the
                  modelling time respectively. This decline in the number of infectious individuals as seen
                  in Figure 6(b) reflects that, the controls; media campaign and treatments has a significant
                  impact in the human population and thus causes reduction in the number of infected humans
                  during an outbreak. On the other hand, Figures 6(c) and 6(d) depicts that the control
                  parameter u3 has a positive impacts on the food compartments. We notice that the in the
                  presence of controls there is reduction in the amount of food products as time increases
                  (Figure 6(d)) and vise versa for the uncontaminated food products (Figure 6(c)). The
                  biological significance of this result reflects that controlling the removal of food product
                  is essential in other to eradicate food-borne Listeriosis. Figure 5 shows the control profiles
                  over time for the control variables u1 , u2 and u3 respectively. A fascinating result can be
                  seen in the first two control variables u1 and u2 . They start at the upper bound and remains
                  at the this upper bound, while for the control variable u3 its starts its lower bound and also
                  remains at the lower bound within the simulation time. These results can be interpreted
                  as follows: during an an infection period, the media campaigns needs to be implemented
                  permanently to raise awareness in order humans to take precautionary measure to avoid been
                  infected. Also, the removal of contaminated food products is supposed to be implemented
                  permanently, for example, the recall of food products as implemented by South African
                  government in the year 2018.

                  Employing treatment only as a control measure we notice that the optimal trajectories of
                  Figure 7(a), 7(b) and Figure 7(d) do not achieve the targeted goal of minimizing the disease
                  in the infected humans and also a reduction in the number of contaminated food, but Figure
                  7(c) do increase the uncontaminated food. This implies that using treatment only is not an

                  In Figure 9, we consider the dynamics of employing treatment and removal of food products
                  only as a control measures. We notice that the combination of these two controls has an
                  impact of reduction of the disease. Hence in the absence of media campaign, Listerisois
                  can also be monitor in any community induced with the disease by the use of treatment and
                  removal of food product only.

                  5.4 Control Strategy Using Treatment and Removal of Food Products Only
                  In Figure 7, we use the combination of media campaign and removal of food product to
                  ascertain the effect of the two permissible controls. We notice that, the combination of these
                  two controls with removal of food products play a vital role in the reduction of disease in the
                  infected compartment faster than the possible combination of treatment and removal of food
                  products only (subsection 5.3) and that of media campaign and treatment only (subsection
                  5.5).

                  Finally, we study the optimal trajectories generated by using media campaigns and treatment
                  only. We observe that the use of these control reduces the number of infections in the
                  infected human compartment as depicted in Figure 10(b) but does not help in eradicating
                  the disease during the entire period of the simulation period. In Figure 10(d) we can see
                  that using these controls does not reduce the contaminated food products. This indicates
                  that to reduce the total amount of contaminated food products it requires the combinations
                  of all three the controls, thus media campaign, treatment and removal of food product as
                  discussed in subsection 5.1.

                  6 Conclusion
                  In this paper, we studied the transmission dynamics of human Listeriosis disease resulting
                  from the consumption of ready-to-eat food products, described using a set of six differential
                  equations with the inclusion of control strategies. Mathematical analysis of the model
                  equations without controls is presented. We found that the model has three steady states
                  which were established to be locally asymptotically stable using the food contamination
                  number Rf . The food contamination threshold is critical for the persistence or minimization
                  of the disease. An optimal control problem was formulated with a goal to reducing
                  the number of human Listeria infections. Numerical simulations reveal that constant
                  implementation of media campaigns, treatment and removal of food products will be a
                  very effective measure in the controlling and management of Listerisois in the event of an
                  outbreak (see Figure 6). The model presented in the paper is not without shortfalls. We
                  considered a constant human population model, implying that the long term dynamics of
                  the model assumes the population will be constant over the modelling time, which may
                  not be realistic. The contribution of the bacteria from the environment in an epidemic is
                  minute. However, we argue that the bacteria in the environment can be instrumental in
                  the growth of an epidemic. The growth function for the L. monocytogenes is logistic but
                  environmental changes could impact the growth of the bacteria and hence a periodic function
                  could better model the growth and abundance of the bacteria. Despite the shortcomings the
                  results obtained from our findings could be used in food risk assessment to quantify the
                  potential public health benefits on most effective control strategies to reduce food product
                  contamination and control of human Listeria infections.
