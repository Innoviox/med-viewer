          ABSTRACT
          Objectives: It is unclear how people with hypertension are responding to the COVID-19
          pandemic given their increased risk, and whether targeted public health strategies are
          needed.
          Design: This retrospective case-control study compared people with hypertension to
          matched healthy controls during COVID-19 lockdown, to determine whether they have
          higher risk perceptions, anxiety and prevention intentions.
          Methods: Baseline data from a national survey were collected in April 2020 during COVID-
          19 lockdown. Of 4362 baseline participants, 466 people reported hypertension with no other
          chronic conditions, and were randomly matched to healthy controls with similar age, gender,
          education and health literacy. A subset (n=1369) was followed-up at 2 months after
          restrictions eased, including 147 participants with hypertension only. Risk perceptions,
          prevention intentions and anxiety were measured.
          Results: At baseline, perceived seriousness was high for both hypertension and control
          groups. The hypertension group had higher anxiety than controls; and were more willing to
          have the influenza vaccine. At follow-up, these differences were no longer present in the
          longitudinal sub-sample. Perceived seriousness and anxiety had decreased, but vaccine
          intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high (>80%).
          Conclusions: Anxiety was above normal levels during the COVID-19 lockdown. This was
          higher in the hypertension group, who also had higher vaccination intentions. Locations with
          prolonged restrictions may require targeted mental health screening for vulnerable groups.
          Despite a decrease in perceived risk and anxiety after 2 months of lockdown restrictions,
          vaccination intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high, which is encouraging
          for future prevention of COVID-19.

          INTRODUCTION
          Although research on COVID-19 risk factors is constantly evolving, there is consistent
          evidence that people with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are more likely to experience
          severe complications and are more likely to die if they acquire COVID-19 (Zaman et al.,
          2020). People with CVD are more likely to have co-morbidities that may complicate their
          response to COVID-19, and COVID-19 causes cardiovascular damage (Li, Hu, & Gu, 2020).
          There has been prominent media coverage about such risks including people with
          hypertension (Dunlevy, 2020; Hanrahan, 2020; Mckie, 2020), and there are concerns that
          people with CVD are not presenting to GPs and hospitals for management and new
          symptoms due to fear of contracting COVID-19 (Thornton, 2020). This study investigates
          whether people with hypertension have higher risk perceptions, anxiety and prevention
          intentions during COVID-19 restrictions, to inform targeted public health messaging for this
          group.
          METHODS
          Data from a national Australian survey were used to conduct retrospective case-control
          analyses comparing hypertension and control groups. Baseline data were collected from all
          states/territories in April 2020 during COVID-19 lockdown, with a subsample followed-up in
          June 2020 when restrictions eased. Of 4362 baseline participants, those reporting high
          blood pressure with no other chronic conditions (n=466) were randomly matched to
          individual healthy controls based on age (+/-3 years), gender, education and health literacy
          adequacy (given baseline survey differences(McCaffery et al., 2020)). The initial match rate
          was 95.7%, with constraints relaxed until all cases were paired. Appropriate regression
          models were conducted using Stata/IC v16.1 (linear models for continuous outcomes,
          generalised linear models with modified Poisson approach for dichotomous outcomes,
          ordinal logistic regression for ordered categorical outcomes) with robust error variances to
                                                                                                                                4

          account for pair clustering, with adjustment for matching variables. A subset of the original
          survey cohort (n=1369) was followed-up at 2 months, including 147 participants with
          hypertension only, and the matching and analysis process was repeated.
          The survey measures and full sample results are reported elsewhere (McCaffery et al.,
          2020; Wolf et al., 2020), including the Health Literacy single item screener (Wallace, Rogers,
          Roskos, Holiday, & Weiss, 2006), CHAI patient activation measure(Wolf et al., 2018), and
          State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Bekker, Legare, Stacey, O’Connor, & Lemyre, 2003;
          Marteau & Bekker, 1992). Risk perceptions and prevention behaviours were measured using
          Likert and categorical scales (Table 1). The perceived seriousness of the COVID-19 threat
          was asked generally at baseline, but at follow-up participants were asked about the public
          health risk generally from COVID-19, globally and in Australia specifically, given the
          divergent pattern of control across countries.
          RESULTS
          Table 1 describes the case versus control samples for all baseline outcomes, and Table 2
          shows details of the regression models comparing the two groups at this timepoint.
          Description of sample
          The hypertension sample included 466 people reporting only high blood pressure and no
          other chronic health conditions, to isolate effects of hypertension. The average age was
          53.52 years [SD 15.50], with 52% female, 47% male and 1% unspecified. The majority had a
          university degree (61%) and adequate health literacy (92%). The average patient activation
          score was comparable to other patient populations (mean scaled CHAI 74.9). Most were
          taking anti-hypertensive medications (77%), with 45% obtaining a refill during lockdown, 5%
          switching to a longer prescription, and only 1 person stopping medication.
                                                                                                                                5

          Risk perceptions
          At baseline the perceived seriousness of threat from COVID-19 in the hypertension group
          was high (mean 7.72/10). On average the hypertension sample thought that 7% of people
          who get COVID-19 would die as a result, and 63% would only experience mild symptoms.
          There were no significant differences between the hypertension group and matched controls
          at baseline. At follow-up, those with hypertension (6.12/10) perceived a greater threat than
          controls (5.52/10) when asked about Australia [MMD: 0.60, 95%CI: 0.05 to 1.15; p=0.032]
          but not generally/globally.
          Anxiety
          At baseline, 76% of the hypertension group had felt nervous or stressed about COVID-19 in
          the past week at least some of the time. On average the mean STAI was 1.90 units higher
          [95%CI: 0.19 to 3.61, p=0.03, Cohen’s d=0.13] for those with hypertension (40.75) than
          matched controls (38.85), with both groups higher than normal range, but below clinical
          levels. At follow-up there was no longer a significant difference between the hypertension
          (37.02) and control (36.08) groups [MMD: 0.94, 95%CI: -2.57 to 4.45; p=0.597, Cohen’s
          d=0.06], with anxiety reduced to within normal range in both groups.
          Prevention behaviours
          At baseline the hypertension group had a social distancing score of 6.48/7 indicating strong
          agreement with the importance of social distancing for ones’ own health and the health of
          the public. Most people were leaving home a few times a week (38%) or once a day (33%)
          during lockdown. Overall, 83% agreed they would get the influenza vaccine and 87% would
          get the COVID-19 vaccine. Compared to healthy matched controls, the hypertension group
          was more likely to agree that they would (or have already) received the influenza vaccine
          this year [aOR: 1.52, 95%CI: 1.10 to 2.11, p=0.01]. There were no significant differences in
          willingness to vaccinate for COVID-19 (if it became available), social distancing or leaving
          the house. At follow-up there was no longer a significant difference between the
                                                                                                                                6

          DISCUSSION
          The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the current
          study amidst the pandemic in Australia, the main finding observed was anxiety, with higher
          than ‘normal’ levels during lockdown restrictions in both groups but more so for those with
          hypertension. This is consistent with the Australian Bureau of Statistics finding that anxiety in
          the general population was double the rate in April 2020 compared to a survey in 2017-18
          (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2020). Elevated anxiety during a global pandemic and
          unprecedented social and economic restrictions could be viewed as appropriate. On the
          other hand, prioritising mental health screening for more vulnerable groups with higher
          anxiety may be warranted given concerns about the mental health effects of COVID-19
          (Wang et al., 2020). Those with hypertension were more likely to take up the influenza
          vaccine during lockdown compared to healthy controls. This difference in willingness does
          not appear to translate to a COVID-19 vaccine, but acceptance rates were high generally at
          baseline (Dodd et al., 2020) and even after risk perceptions and anxiety decreased when
          restrictions lifted.
                                                                                                                                8

          Strengths & limitations
          The strengths of this study include a large national sample with data during and after
          lockdown restrictions, that enabled matched case-control analyses between participants with
          self-reported hypertension and healthy controls and the use of established well validated
          measures.
          The sample was recruited via an online panel and social media, and has a low proportion of
          culturally and linguistically diverse participants. The survey involved non-stratified sampling
          without targeted recruitment of specific health conditions, and only a subset were included in
          the longitudinal sub-study.
          Conclusion
          Anxiety was above normal levels for all groups during the COVID-19 lockdown. This was
          higher in the hypertension group and appeared to translate to higher influenza vaccination
          intentions. In Australia, where lockdown effectively reduced the spread of COVID-19 and
          restrictions eased relatively quickly, these differences dissipated after 2 months, but
          locations with prolonged restrictions may require targeted psychological screening for
          vulnerable groups. Despite a decrease in perceived seriousness and anxiety after 2 months
          of lockdown restrictions, vaccination intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained
          high (80%), which is encouraging for future prevention of COVID-19.
                                                                                                                                9
