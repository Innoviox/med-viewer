 1   Abstract
 2   Currently, airborne transmission is seen as the most important transmission path for SARS-
 3   CoV-2. In this investigation, a models of other researchers with the aim to predict an infection
 4   risk for exposed persons in a room through aerosols emitted by an infectious case-patient
 5   were extended. As a novelty ‚Äì usually neglected ‚Äì parameters or boundary conditions, namely
 6   the non-stationarity of aerosol and the half life of aerosolized virus, were included and a new
 7   method for determining the quanta emission rate based on measurements of the particle
 8   emission rate and respiratory rate at different types of activities was implemented.
 9   As a second step, the model was applied to twelve outbreaks to compare the predicted
10   infection risk with the observed attack rate. To estimate a ‚Äúcredible interval‚Äù of the predicted
11   infection risk the quanta emission rate, the respiratory rate as well as the air volume flow were
12   varied.
13   In nine out of twelve outbreaks, the calculated predicted infection risk via aerosols was found
14   to be in the range the attack rate (with the variation of the boundary conditions) and reasons
15   for the observed larger divergence were discussed.
16   The validation was considered successful and therefore, the use of the model could be
17   recommended to predict the risk of an infection via aerosols in given situations. Furthermore,
18   appropriate preventive measures can be designed.

20   Introduction
21   The respiratory route is the main mode of transmission for the virus causing COVID-19
22   (SARS-CoV-2) [1, 2, 3]. The virus is transported on particles that can enter the respiratory
23   tract. Whereas larger particles (droplets) are only able to stay in the air for a short time and
24   just in the near field (approx. 1.5 m), because they settle down quickly, smaller particles
25   (called aerosols) are also concentrated in the near field and in addition can follow the air flow

26   and cause infections in the far field. Epidemiologically, short-range transmission (through
27   aerosols or droplets) is distinguished from long-range transmission (aerosol).
28   In order to perform an infection risk assessment for the airborne transmission in the far field
29   and to introduce appropriate preventive measures, it would be necessary to know the amount
30   of aerosols produced by an infected person during various activities, how many viruses stick
31   to the aerosols and how many viruses are necessary to cause an infection. However, this
32   information is usually available very late during the course of a pandemic, if it can be
33   determined at all. Another well-known approach is to use retrospective analysis of infection
34   outbreaks that are very probably due to far field transmission to determine a virus-laden
35   aerosol concentration. Exposed people have inhaled the virus-laden aerosols according to
36   their respiratory volume flow. The approach presented here corresponds to a combination of
37   known measured source rates of respiratory aerosols at different activities and the
38   retrospective analysis of previous infection incidents with the aim to calculate a predicted
39   infection risk via aerosols and to calculate the necessary air volume flow to reduce the risk of
40   COVID-19 infections.
41
42   State of the Art
43   The so-called aerosols (liquid or solid particles in a dispersed phase with a fluid) as well as
44   droplets differ by size. The particles, which are transported in a fluid over a longer distance,
45   are called aerosols. Droplets are stronger influenced by gravitation and are depositing more
46   rapidly. Depending on the fluid velocity the size of particles, which can be transported in air
47   for a longer distance, is different. In internal spaces with typical air velocities of up to 0.2 m/s
48   particles smaller than 10 Œºm will be distributed by air very well, with a higher air velocity
49   larger particles may be transported in air as well.

50   SARS-CoV-2 was found to be transmitted via close contact as well as over distance in
51   internal spaces, whereby in distant transmission so-called super-spreading events are more
52   probable [1, 2, 4].
53   In 1978, Riley et al. [5] evaluated a measles outbreak in a suburban elementary school. Based
54   on the number of susceptible persons (S), which have been infected (D) during each stage of
55   infection, the risk (P) for an infection in this stage has been calculated regarding equation (1).
56   Therefore, the risk for an infection has been defined as the percentage of infected persons
57   from the number of pupils not already infected or vaccinated.
              ùê∑                                                                                                                  (1)
      ùëÉ=
              ùëÜ
58   A Poisson-distribution of the risk of infection has been assumed as well as a stationary and
59   evenly distributed concentration of the pathogens in the room air. Equation (2) shows the
60   Poisson-distribution.
      ùëÉ = 1 ‚àí ùëí ‚àíùúÜ                                                                                                              (2)
61   Therefore, Wells defined in 1955 [6] a size called quantum as the number of emitted
62   infectious units, where the probability to get infected is 1 ‚àí ùëí ‚àí1 = 63.2%. Hence, a quantum
63   can be seen as a combination of the amount of emitted aerosols with the virus transported on
64   them and a critical dose, which may result in an infection in 63.2 % of the exposed persons.
65   Using the quantum concept as well as equation (2) has been combined by Riley [5] to
66   equation (3).
      ùëÉ = 1 ‚àí ùëí ‚àíùêº‚àôùëû‚àôùëÑùëè‚àôùë°/ùëÑ                                                                                                     (3)
67   In equation (3), the number of infectious persons (I), the quanta emission rate depending on
68   the activity (q), the pulmonary ventilation rate of exposed susceptible persons (Qb), the
69   duration of stay (t) and the volume flow of pathogen free air (Q) was used. The quotient q/Q
70   represents the quanta concentration.

71   In poorly ventilated rooms, the assumption of a stationary concentration of quanta is not
72   justified, because of the long time, which is necessary until the stationary concentration is
73   reached. The normalized time-dependent concentration process can be calculated according to
74   equation (4) and is shown in Figure 1. How rapidly the concentration of a human emitted
75   contamination in a room raises depends on the air exchange rate (ACH) and the time (t). This
76   relative concentration (crel) can be seen as an increase in the concentration compared to the
77   volume flow.

83   aerosols are evenly distributed in the room air. To avoid this assumption Noakes and Sleigh
84   [7] divided the room air into different zones, which are themselves considered to be well
85   mixed and have a uniform concentration. This should make it possible to calculate local
86   differences in concentration and thus locally differing infection risks. Furthermore, other

 91
 92   To estimate the risk of infection in a given setting by a given infectious person with the
 93   Wells-Riley-equation either the quanta emission rate or the P have to be known. In the
 94   beginning of an epidemic, both values are unknown. Dai and Zhao [9] correlated and
 95   calculated q for SARS-CoV-2 based on the basic reproduction number (R0) known from
 96   former outbreaks of MERS, tuberculosis, Influenza as well as SARS-CoV-1 and published
 97   the equation (5). If R0 is known, q can be estimated as proposed by Dai and Zhao [9]. For
 98   SARS-CoV-2 the average basic reproduction number has been estimated to be 3.28 [10], 3.32
 99   [11] and 3.77 [12].

100
101   In various studies of infection occurrences associated with SARS-CoV-2, q was determined
102   using the Wells-Riley equation. Different authors [9, 13] found a range of 22 to 61 quanta/h
103   with an assumed low activity (breathing, speaking) and values of 341 to 1190 quanta/h when
104   singing.
105
106   The virus can be transported on particles in air and the emission of aerosols can be used as an
107   indicator for the emission of virus, but a correlation between q and the aerosol emission rate
108   (E) has not been investigated so far. In measurements at the Hermann-Rietschel-Institute
109   (HRI) of Technical University of Berlin [14, 15] the particle emission rates during breathing,
110   speaking, coughing as well as singing was measured. During breathing through the nose about

111   25 particles/s was emitted and during coughing about 13,700 particles/cough, whereas it can
112   be seen that depending on the activity a wide range of particle emission rates can be found.
113   The transmission of a pathogen via aerosols is also influenced by the stability of the virus in
114   the environment. In an experimental study van Doremalen et al [16] measured the decrease of
115   infectious virus in air and on different surfaces and compared SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-
116   2. Under the given conditions, the half-life of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV-1 was
117   about 1.1 h.
118   The longer aerosols stay in the room air the proportion of inactivated virus is increasing. The
119   age of air is depending on the airflow as well as the position of the source of pollutants. At
120   each point in the room, a local age of air can be calculated. The age of air (œÑn) can be used as a
121   measure to evaluate the air quality. For an ideal mixing ventilation, the mean age of air is
122   equal to the nominal time constant, which can be calculated using equation (6) as the quotient
123   of the room volume (V) and the air volume flow (Q).

124   Besides the number of emitted pathogen-laden aerosols, the number of inhaled pathogens is
125   playing an important role as well with regard to the assessment of the risk of infection. The
126   pulmonary ventilation rate may differ with different activities. Gupta et al. [17] performed a
127   study with 25 healthy adults and found a sine wave for mere breathing, but a more constant
128   volume flow during talking.
129   In measurements with athletes as well as sedentary persons a maximum volume flow for the
130   athletes of 200 l/min (12 m¬≥/h) was found by C√≥rdova and Latasa [18].
131   To measure the airflow without movement restrictions, a helmet was used by Jiang et al. [19]
132   in 32 subjects (16 males, 16 females) during speaking with different volumes as well as
133   during singing.

134   A comparison between a machine-learning based model and measurements of respiratory rate
135   was performed by Dumond et al. [20].
136   As a conclusion, the following average values can be used for adults:
137        ÔÇ∑    low activity (breathing while lying): 0.45 m3/h [19]
138        ÔÇ∑    low activity (breathing while sitting, standing or talking): 0.54 m3/h [19, 20]
139        ÔÇ∑    singing: 0.65 m3/h [21]
140        ÔÇ∑    mid activity (physical work): 0.9 m3/h [20]
141        ÔÇ∑    sports: 1.2 m3/h [18, 20]
142   For children, the lung volume is smaller. Therefore, the respiratory rate for children aged 14
143   can be assumed to be 0.45 m3/h for low activity (breathing while sitting, standing, talking)
144   [22].

146   Methods
147   Extension of the Wells-Riley equation for calculating the Predicted Infection Risk via
148   Aerosols (PIRA)
149   The Wells-Riley equation can be summarized as equation (7). To calculate the predicted
150   infection risk via aerosols (PIRA) in the far field of a room the concentration of quanta (c(t))
151   and the respiratory rate (Qb) has to be known. The integration of c(t) can be understood as the
152   amount of particles inhaled per m3/h. With Qb the number of inhaled quanta can therefore be
153   calculated.
       ùëÉùêºùëÖùê¥ = 1 ‚àí ùëí (‚àí ‚à´[ùëê(ùë°)]‚àôùëÑùëè)                                                                                              (7)
154   Equation (5) can be used for the definition of the quantum emission. This leads to a quanta
155   emission rate of q = 40 1/h at an assumed mean R0 = 3.35. The mathematical approximation
156   presented by Dai und Zhao [9] can be optimized by equation (8), see Figure 2. For Figure 2

157   the quanta emission rate has been correlated with R0 of tuberculosis [23, 24], Influenza [23,
158   25], MERS [26, 27] and SARS-CoV [23, 28].
159   Equation (8) results in q = 139 1/h for an assumed mean R0 = 3.35. Because of the high
160   variance of the q as well as R0 given in the currently available literature the difference
161   between the q calculated regarding equation (5) and equation (8) seems reasonable.

173   The effect of e.g. mouth-nose protection can be considered by using their filtration efficiency
174   (FMNS) like in equation (10) which however will not be further considered in the following.

176   It is known that the infectivity of an infected person depends on the disease progression over
177   time [30]. This is shown qualitatively in Figure 3. With a simplified mathematical approach,
178   this can be integrated into the quanta source rate. An equation could be implemented to take
179   this into account.

183   Under experimental conditions, the half-life of virus was measured as 1.1 h [16]. Thus, the
184   number of emitted infectious quanta at time t (qa(t)) is calculated according to equation (11).

185   The concentration of quanta during the increase cI(t) can be calculated according to equation
186   (12) with the number of infectious persons (n).

187   An additional case is considered that if the time t is longer than the age of the air œÑn, most of
188   the virus-laden aerosols have left the room with the exhaust, before the inactivation can take

192   For calculating the risk of infection the unsteady concentrations cI and cœÑ has to be used, to

199        For the calculation of PIRA the following assumptions must be considered:
200        ÔÇ∑    the aerosols are ideally mixed in the room
201        ÔÇ∑    the near field (up to approx. 1.5 m distance from the emitting person) can contain a
202             much higher virus-laden aerosol concentration
203        ÔÇ∑    the air, which is introduced into the room, is free of virus-laden aerosols (e.g. outside
204             air)
205        ÔÇ∑    no deposition of small particles is considered, because the settling time is longer than
206             the stability of the virus and the deposition rate would therefore be substantially
207             smaller than the inactivation
208        ÔÇ∑    the concentration of aerosols at the beginning is 0

210   The PIRA calculation model was validated by using parameters of several known outbreaks
211   during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Twelve different scenarios either scientifically published
212   or registered by the local health authorities were selected (A-L). The boundary conditions for
213   the calculations of these situations can be found in Table 1.

216   The infection events used for the validation of the model are shown in Table 1 with the
217   necessary parameters for the calculation. In the following, the comparison between the
218   documented Attack Rate (AR) and the PIRA is drawn.
219   The q used here was calculated according to equation (9) with the assumption that the cases
220   emitted particles as measured in [14, 15]. Due to the high spread of the particle emission E
221   and the unknown proportions of breathing, speaking, singing and shouting as well as the
222   respiratory volume flows, simplified a-priori assumptions were made. To take into account
223   the effects of the uncertainties regarding q, Qb and especially with window ventilation on Q,
224   these values were further varied - q by +/- 20%, Qb by +/- 20% and Q by +/- 50%,
225   individually and in combination, which then lead to a minimum PIRA and maximum PIRA.
226   Figure 4 presents PIRA and the minima and maxima calculated with the different variants.
227   The red dots show the documented AR.

236   From the PIRA model, it can be calculated how much volume flow per hour of exposure time
237   is required to not exceed a certain PIRA. The results are shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that
238   for a PIRA of 10% a volume flow of clean air of 750 m¬≥/h and hour of exposure has to be
239   supplied to the room (see Table 3), whereas for two hours 1500 m¬≥/h will be necessary for the

241   As a regression of the calculated results presented in Figure 5 equation (19) was derived.
242   Using equation (19) the required volume flow per hour of exposure time can be calculated.
243   This information refers to the steady state if the product of ACH and t is higher than 5.0, see
244   Figure 1. If the product is smaller, correspondingly lower volume flows lead to the respective

259   only one probably infected person in a room with two persons. For a volume flow of
260   60 m¬≥/(h¬∑Per) the number decreases to two probably infected persons in a room with 20, 40 or
261   100 persons, but of course stayed at one probably person for just two persons in a room.

265   Discussion
266   For the first time with a q based on R0 the PIRA was calculated for different known SARS-
267   CoV-2 outbreaks. In addition, the necessary air volume flows to reduce the risk of infection
268   were calculated.
269   In Table 4 the q-values are compared according to the stationary equation (3) and the PIRA
270   model under the boundary conditions of Table 1. Large differences between the same
271   activities were observed in the calculation of steady-state.
272   First of all, in comparison, with fixed q according to equation (9) very good agreement can be
273   achieved with the documented AR in the retrospectively considered cases A, B, C, H, I, J, K.

276
277   In outbreak D, the documentation does not clearly show how large the actual AR was for the
278   area under consideration. Due to the fact, that only the person who showed symptoms was
279   isolated, it is possible that in the meantime, additional persons, who were already infected by
280   the index case may have infected others (e.g. presymptomatically) leading to the high AR.
281   In outbreak E, there is only little documentation of the infection process, and further contact
282   between some of the persons has occurred in a restaurant afterwards. Furthermore, it has not
283   been determined whether the infection can be attributed to only one person. The high AR after
284   a short time of exposure allows the conclusion that either two index persons were present or
285   that the exposure time was prolonged by the meeting in a restaurant.
286   In outbreak F, the group was not together for the entire time and some of the subjects
287   continued rehearsing in another room. For this reason, the exposure time for the whole group
288   was lower and therefore this may account for the lower AR than calculated by PIRA is given.
289   In outbreak L an air exchange rate of 21 1/h was assumed. A relatively small change in the
290   assumed volume flow has a significant influence on the result of PIRA (where the total
291   exposure time was used). Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that droplet transmission may
292   also have happened.
293   Secondly, many assumptions were made, therefore it is not clear if the formula is already
294   optimal, perhaps further optimization during the course of the pandemic is possible if further
295   knowledge is available.

296   Third, the calculation model does not consider the sedimentation behavior of particles. It is
297   known that at higher air velocities and especially at high turbulence the sedimentation
298   behavior increases. In typical indoor air flows this decrease is about 10 % per hour. Compared
299   to the uncertainty of the overall emission rate, this effect is not significant.
300   Fourth, the calculation model assumes a homogeneous distribution of the particles in the room
301   air. Practically however the ventilation effectiveness is locally very different. The differences
302   can be slightly greater than 100%.
303   Finally, it must be noted that the aerosol concentration is significantly higher in the near field
304   of the emitting person and the results of PIRA are not valid within the generally accepted
305   1.5 m distance rules.
306
307   Conclusion
308   It was shown in this investigation that it was possible to calculate the risk of an infection via
309   aerosols for situations where the long-distance transmission is more important. By using the
310   model presented here, a good agreement to previous infection outbreaks in different settings
311   and different attack rates was achieved. Previous retrospectively determined quanta emission
312   rates usually assumed a stationary state. However, if the concentration process is important
313   for the total amount of inhaled virus-laden aerosols (usually at ACH x t < 5), then a stationary
314   observation leads to an incorrect boundary condition. The time-dependent viability of the
315   virus also plays a significant role. Here, the influence of the viability is higher at low air
316   change rates compared with high ones, because the virus stays in the room air for a longer
317   time period and the proportion of inactivated pathogens increase. However, the effect of time-
318   dependent viability is not that important that a low air change rate has an overall positive
319   effect.
320   To reduce the risk of infection via aerosols the necessary volume flow of virus-free air
321   depending on the exposure time can be seen in Figure 5. This figure may be helpful to

322   implement measures, like increasing the virus-free air supply rate. Furthermore, the number of
323   exposed persons has to be kept in mind. An infection risk of 60% may result in one infected
324   person in a two-person office, but in 60 infected persons in a room with 100 persons.
325   Predicting the infection risk via aerosols and knowing the important parameters can help in the
326   selection of appropriate preventive actions.
