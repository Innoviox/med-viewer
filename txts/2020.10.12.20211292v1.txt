   Abstract
   Enamel-only proximal caries, if detected, can be reversed by non-invasive treatments. Dental
   bitewing radiograph analysis is central to diagnosis and treatment planning and, when used to
   detect enamel-only proximal caries, it is an important tool in minimum intervention and preventive
   dentistry. However, the subtle patterns of enamel-only proximal caries visible in bitewing
   radiographs are difficult to detect and often missed by dental practitioners. This study measures the
   ability of dentists to detect enamel-only proximal caries in bitewing radiographs with and without
   the use of AssistDent® Artificial Intelligence (AI) software.
   23 dentists were randomly divided into a control arm, in which no Artificial Intelligence assistance
   was provided, and an experimental arm in which Artificial Intelligence assistance provided on-screen
   prompts for potential locations of enamel-only proximal caries. All participants analysed a set of 24
   bitewings, gathered from one dental hospital and 11 general dental practices, which had previously
   been analysed independently by a panel of 5 dento-maxillofacial radiologists and 1 professor of
   restorative dentistry who, between them, identified a total of 65 enamel-only carious lesions and
   241 healthy proximal surfaces.
   Results demonstrate that dentists using the assistive software found 75.8% of the enamel-only
   proximal caries compared to a 44.3% detection rate in the control group. This represents an absolute
   increase of 31.5% (relative increase in sensitivity of 71%). Participants in the experimental group
   incorrectly identified 14.6% of the healthy surfaces as having enamel-only proximal caries compared
   to 3.7% in the control group, an absolute increase of 10.9% (relative decrease in specificity of 11%).
   T-test analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference (p<0.01) between the two arms in
   sensitivity  (true reports

   We conclude that AssistDent® Artificial Intelligence software significantly improves dentists’ ability
   to detect enamel-only proximal caries, with only a slight increase in false positives, and could be
   considered as a tool to support minimum intervention and preventive dentistry in general practice.
   Introduction
   The early detection and treatment of enamel-only proximal caries can preserve tooth structure and
   prevent the subsequent cycle of treatment and re-treatment that is involved with more invasive
   treatment. Recent guidelines from the NHS encourage preventive care in dental practices, especially
   for young children. Patients differ widely on their willingness to pay for preventive therapies1 but
   nearly all parents value a healthy dentition for their children and are willing to invest resources to
   maintain this.2 However, it is well documented that preventive care in adults is offered less
   frequently than it should be and therefore if prevention is to be adopted more widely in adults,
   caries detection must be time efficient and accurate. Only then can the ideal, personalised caries
   assessment of adult patients and their preventive care be developed.
   Radiographic examinations can increase the number of carious lesions that are detected and that
   would not be detectable by clinical examination alone. Nevertheless, systematic reviews have
   consistently shown that detection of proximal caries on bitewing radiography has a low sensitivity.3
   A number of studies have reported poor diagnostic sensitivity for radiographic detection of
   demineralisation by dentists. In a classic study by Mejàre et al.4, premolar and adjacent teeth
   surfaces were examined radiographically and visually. The premolar teeth were then extracted for
   orthodontic reasons. They found that the sensitivity of detection of enamel-only proximal caries
   was 36.7%. Other studies have found similarly low sensitivity values.5,6
   The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods allows assessment of routine tasks to be
   conducted more quickly and efficiently. AssistDent® is an AI software product, developed by
   Manchester Imaging Limited, and uses machine learning algorithms to search for evidence of
   enamel-only proximal caries on bitewing radiographs.7 It is an aid to the dentist, assisting their
   clinical decision-making by provided on-screen prompts for potential locations of enamel-only
   proximal caries. The final judgement about whether enamel-only proximal caries is present, or not,
   is a decision for the clinician. The null hypothesis of this research was that there is no difference in
   the performance of dentists in diagnosing the presence of enamel-only proximal caries on bitewing
   radiographs with and without the use of AssistDent®.
   Methods
   A pilot study8 was conducted with dental students to assist in developing the methodology and
   provide initial data for a sample size calculation. Final study protocol, participant information sheet
   and consent forms for the study were approved by the Manchester University Research Ethics
   Committee (Ref: 2020-9892-15955).
   Participants were recruited from two sources: 1) dentists practising as general dental practitioners
   who in addition provide tutorage for dental students within the University of Manchester Dental
   School; 2) practising dentists undertaking postgraduate training within the University of Manchester
   Foundation NHS trust. All signed informed consent forms.
   The dentists were randomly divided into control and experimental arms by pairing the participants
   within the recruitment sources according to the order in which they were enrolled. The first of each
   pair of participants were randomly assigned to either the control or experimental arm with the
                                                                                                                               2

   second assigned to the other group. This method ensured random assignment while maintaining
   even arm sizes equally balanced between the recruitment sources as the study progressed.
   Both arms examined the same images using the same graphical user interface. In the control group
   (n=11), the caries prompting function of AssistDent® was disabled in order to measure the ability of
   the group to detect enamel-only proximal caries without the use of AI software. In the experimental
   group (n=12), the caries prompting function of AssistDent® was enabled in order to assist the
   participants.
   So that the study would have applicability to general practice, a total of 1,446 bitewing radiographs
   were collected from a range of different sites (1 teaching hospital site and 9 general dental
   practitioner (GDP) sites). Separate ethical approval had been received from the Integrated Research
   Application System (IRAS project ID: 248306, REC reference: 18/NI/0111). A validation set of 103
   images were selected by random stratified sampling partitioned over the image acquisition sites and
   excluded from all machine learning model training and evaluation. A further subset of 24 images
   from the validation set were selected for the study, again stratified over the acquisition sites but
   with the criterion that there was at least one enamel-only proximal caries in each image. Images
   from one of the GDP sites were excluded due to their poor quality. Another GDP site lacked images
   with one enamel-only proximal caries, therefore two study images from this site had no enamel-
   only proximal caries. The images were presented to each participant in the same order, grouped
   according to the acquisition site.
   Gold Standard annotation of all classes of proximal caries was obtained from a panel of 5 dento-
   maxillofacial radiologists and 1 Professor of Restorative Dentistry, each of whom annotated the
   location and grade of caries on a set of images. These individual expert annotations were
   consolidated resulting in a gold standard set of 1,972 examples of enamel-only proximal caries for
   algorithm training and evaluation.
   The caries annotations entered by each participant were collected remotely via a web application
   and analysed to determine whether they were true positives (correct identifications of enamel-only
   proximal caries) or false positives (annotations not corresponding to the location of the gold
   standard enamel-only proximal caries). Annotations corresponding to dentine proximal caries were
   recorded but excluded from this analysis. The True Positive Rate or Sensitivity of diagnosis is a
   measure of how well a participant detected the enamel-only proximal caries and was calculated as
   the sum of true positives divided by the sum of the gold standard caries. True Negative Rate or
   Specificity is a measure of how well the participant identified healthy surfaces and did not mark
   them as carious. The probability of a false detection is quoted in terms of a False Positive Rate
   calculated as the sum of false positive detections divided by the sum of healthy surfaces which is
   equal to 1-Specificity.
   Results
   Table 1 presents a per-participant breakdown of the evaluation scores and performance measures
   together with the aggregate scores and measures for each arm. The data demonstrates that 23
   dentists were recruited, 11 in the control arm and 12 in the experimental arm. These were balanced
   within the arms between the two recruitment sources of general dental practitioners and practising
   dentists undertaking postgraduate training. All participants analysed all 24 images. The aggregate
   measures presented at the bottom of the table are calculated as the sum of the quantitative
   measures across all participants within each arm, together with the aggregate performance
   measures.

   Figure 1 illustrates the True Positive and False Positive Rates of each participant on a scatter plot.
   The plot illustrates the close grouping of both true positive and false positive rates for the control
   arm. True positive rate is also tightly grouped for the experimental arm whereas there is a greater
   range in false positive rates which are generally worse than those for the control arm.
   Figure 2 presents the mean true positive and true negative rates over all participants and the 95%
   confidence intervals, for each arm together with the t-test analysis. The improved mean true
   positive rate of the experimental arm participants (75.8% with AssistDent®) compared to the control
   arm (44.3% without AssistDent®) is clearly visible. This is accompanied by a decrease in true negative
   rate from 96.3% to 85.4%. The table in Figure 2 presents the statistical analysis for the performance
   measures within each arm together with the result of a student t-test. The t-tests demonstrate that
   the improved true positive rate and reduced true negative rate of the experimental compared to the
   control arm were significant with p-values below alpha of 0.01.
   Table 2 presents the results of an odds-ratio comparison of true positive and true negative rates for
   each arm. The ratio between the experimental and control groups with a value greater than one
   indicates that use of AssistDent® increased the ability to detect enamel-only proximal caries by 71%.
   Similarly, the ratio of less than 1 for true negative rate indicates that the experimental arm
   participants were 11% less likely to correctly identify healthy proximal surfaces as non-carious.

   Discussion
   Small areas of proximal surface enamel demineralization are difficult to detect visually on
   radiographs.9 In a review of diagnostic studies reported by Keenan and Keenan,10 they found lower
   sensitivities for the detection of proximal lesions in clinical than in vitro studies. The mean sensitivity
   in the clinical studies was 0.24 and for the in vitro studies was 0.43.
   Other studies that have measured sensitivity and specificity of caries detection using radiographs
   have found a large variation. This may be due to variation in the range of caries depth or the use of
   in vitro studies. In our in vivo study, we mainly used a sample of radiographs from a range of dental
   practices that were taken as part of the routine examination of patients. The low sensitivity and high
   specificity of our control group in detecting caries on bitewing radiographs are comparable with the
   above studies, and with that reported in a systematic review.11
   Low sensitivity in the detection of enamel-only caries is problematic in the context of minimally-
   invasive dentistry. A significant increase in sensitivity is required over the values reported in these
   studies, even at the expense of an increased number of false positive detections. Enamel lesions are
   treated in a conservative manner with dietary and interdental cleaning advice, fluoride treatments
   and potentially, resin infiltration. This, in conjunction with cooperation from the patient will prevent
   operative intervention and the entry of the tooth into a restorative cycle of increasingly larger
   restorations and eventual extraction. The relatively small decrease in specificity observed from the
   use of AssistDent® accompanies a much larger increase in sensitivity.
   There has been a growing interest in general dental publications and online fora in the use of AI in
   dentistry. A recent review by Schwedicke et al 12 has described the basics of AI and explored its
   potential use in diagnostics, treatment planning and conduct in dentistry. Computer image analysis
   is a particular application of AI in dentistry (and medicine more generally). An earlier, scoping
   review 13 refers particularly to the application in image diagnostics. There is a relatively small number
   of studies related to caries detection. For example, Lee et al.14 investigated the performance of a
   convolutional neural network on classification of caries in images of individual teeth isolated from
   periapical images. The study did not focus specifically on enamel-only caries. Srivastra et al.15 also
   trained a convolutional neural network for fully automatic detection of caries in bitewing images.
   To our knowledge, AssistDent® is the only commercially available AI system for use in the clinical
   diagnosis of enamel-only proximal caries, acting as a prompting system to support dentists’
   diagnostic decisions. Schwendicke et al 13 recommend that “…the dental community should
   appraise [the AI systems] against the rules of evidence-based practice.” This study is an example of
   such an appraisal.
   It is important that dentists receive appropriate training with any new diagnostic system. Qudeimat
   et al.16 investigated the effect of ICDAS training and found a significant increase in overtreatment
   recommendations. The reproducibility of any diagnostic system depends on the experience of the
   clinician and this is especially so where the diagnosis is a visual score rather than AI-based.17
   How should our profession address the issue of poor sensitivity in detection of early enamel caries?
   Audit, reflection with peer review and evaluation of past performance are essential parts of dental
   practice. An audit of caries diagnosis will rely on identifying opportunities for improvement,
   comparison with an accepted standard of care and implementing change. The increased sensitivity
   arising from AI-supported detection may provide a useful standard for audit in caries detection.
   Testing will also reveal clinicians with unacceptable variation in bitewing analysis competency
   assessments, with direction towards further training. More efficient caries detection may help in
                                                                                                                               8

   identifying patients with higher caries risk, while the associated display of detected caries can
   provide a basis for encouraging a detailed discussion with the patient of their oral health and the
   factors affecting it. The intuitive graphical screen display of AssistDent® may be more readily
   understood by patients in comparison to other algorithm-based tools such as the Cariogram. The
   latter uses a pie-diagram of important factors to illustrate the probability that future caries may be
   prevented.19 However, once the high caries risk individuals are identified, it is important to further
   investigate all the factors predisposing to caries such as a high sugar intake and infrequent
   brushing.19
   Caries assessment by dentists using AssistDent® is compatible with the ICCMS caries management
   system of the ICDAS Foundation and could be used in conjunction with it. AssistDent® provides
   feedback on the proximal enamel surfaces using radiographs whereas ICCMS is a mainly visual
   assessment of the non-proximal surfaces for caries. Both systems aim to maintain tooth structure
   and encourage preventive care by developing a caries assessment for each patient.
   Conclusion
   The small increase in false positive diagnoses that arises from the AI software AssistDent® may result
   in an increase of unnecessary preventative treatment and associated use of limited personal and
   public resources.
   However, the significantly greater increase in sensitivity in detecting enamel-only proximal caries
   should enable increased application of minimally invasive procedures. More accurate targeting of
   preventive treatments would thereby avoid the requirement for later restoration, potentially
   resulting in an overall saving of resources and an improvement in the dentition of patients.
