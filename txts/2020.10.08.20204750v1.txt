                                                               Abstract
                We study the spatio-temporal spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Santiago de Chile using anonymized
            mobile phone data from 1.4 million users, 22% of the whole population in the area, characterizing
            the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the epidemic dynamics. We integrate these
            data into a mechanistic epidemic model calibrated on surveillance data. As of August 1st 2020, we es-
            timate a detection rate of 102 cases per 1,000 infections (90% CI: [95 - 112 per 1,000]). We show that
            the introduction of a full lockdown on May 15th , 2020, while causing a modest additional decrease
            in mobility and contacts with respect to previous NPIs, was decisive in bringing the epidemic under
            control, highlighting the importance of a timely governmental response to COVID-19 outbreaks. We
            find that the impact of NPIs on individuals’ mobility correlates with the Human Development Index
            of comunas in the city. Indeed, more developed and wealthier areas became more isolated after
            government interventions and experienced a significantly lower burden of the pandemic. The hetero-
            geneity of COVID-19 impact raises important issues in the implementation of NPIs and highlights
            the challenges that communities affected by systemic health and social inequalities face adapting
            their behaviors during an epidemic.
   1       Introduction
   As of September 1st , 2020, Chile has reported more than 400, 000 cases and 590 SARS-CoV-2 deaths per
   million, becoming one of the worst COVID-19 epidemic globally [1]. Officially, the first SARS-CoV-2 case
   in Chile was detected on March 3rd , 2020 [2]. Although other cases were rapidly confirmed all over the
   country, the urban area of the capital city, Santiago Metropolitan Region, quickly became the epicenter
   of the national epidemic. Indeed, as of September 1st , 2020, about 70% of the total cases in the nation
   have been reported in the comunas (i.e. municipalities) of Santiago, making it one of the largest urban
   COVID-19 outbreak in the world. The first set of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were put in
   place in mid-March, when schools were closed, public gatherings were banned, and passengers traveling
   from high-risk countries were mandated to self-isolate for 14 days. However, the adopted measures were
   not able to contain the contagion: after a sharp increase in cases, a full lockdown was instituted to the
   whole area of Santiago on May 15th [3].
        In this work, we model the spatial and temporal spread of COVID-19 in 37 comunas of the urban
   area of Santiago. We aim to provide a data-driven characterization of the unfolding of the COVID-19
   epidemic and an estimation of the impact of NPIs on its spreading. To this end, we study the reduction
   of mobility and contacts inferred from mobile devices as input for a spatially structured epidemic model.
   In fact, mobile devices data can be used to evaluate, in near real-time, the effects of interventions and
   self-initiated behavioral changes on the mobility of people and to inform large scale epidemic models
   [4–8]. Here, we use anonymised data provided by a major mobile phone operator in South America
   (Telefónica Movistar), with a market share of 24.61% as of March 2020.

       To characterize the changes of mobility and physical contacts during the outbreak, we used anonymised
   data from 1.4 million mobile devices (about 22% of the total population in the comunas under consid-
   eration). We find consistent downward trends coinciding with the NPIs issued by local and national
   authorities. We estimate that the first set of NPIs issued on 16/03 led to a reduction of about 48% in
   the number of travels between comunas. An additional 17% reduction is observed with the introduction
   of the full lockdown on 15/05. Furthermore, we find that changes in mobility patterns strongly correlate
   with the economic and development indicators of the comunas.
       We develop a stochastic mechanistic epidemic model integrating the real-time mobility, physical
   contacts, and census data. The model suggests that the full lockdown, while causing a modest additional
   decrease in mobility and physical contacts with respect to the NPIs already in place, was decisive in
   bringing the epidemic under control. This relatively small additional decrease in mobility and contacts
   was enough to push the effective reproductive number below the critical value of 1, a clear example of
   the threshold effects characterizing epidemic dynamics on structured mobility networks [9]. We estimate
   that the full lockdown prevented an additional 34.7% (95% CI: [27.2%, 44.1%]) increase in the total
   number of deaths. Additionally, we estimate the critical impact of the timing of the full lockdown
   through counterfactual scenarios: an additional week of delay would have corresponded to an 18.1%
   (95% CI: [6.0%, 34.0%]) more intense incidence peak according to our estimates. The model captures
   the heterogeneous burden of COVID-19 across comunas, observed in the epidemiological data reported
   by the national surveillance. This highlights how communities exhibiting systemic social disparities are
   affected in a differential way by government-mandated NPIs due to challenges faced in reducing their
   mobility and contacts, raising the issue of health disparities in the management of emerging infectious
   diseases such as COVID-19.
   2      Results
   We evaluate the effects of NPIs policies, government-mandated mobility limitations by integrating mobile
   phone data and an epidemic model. We identify three phases of the epidemic management in Santiago:
   i) before 16/03 (business as usual, baseline) ii) between 16/03 and 15/05 (first set of NPIs interventions),
   and iii) after 15/05 (full lockdown). For convenience, we will refer to the period 16/03-15/05 as the partial
   lockdown and to the period after 15/05 as the full lockdown. It is important to notice how the timeline of
   interventions is fairly complex. It includes night curfews, dynamic quarantine, and lockdowns restricted
   to a few comunas across the region studied here and in other parts of Chile [2]. However, as we see below,
   the data suggest that those measures did not have a significant impact on people’s behaviors, thus for
   simplicity we consider the two main sets of NPIs only. We characterize the three phases outlined above
   in terms of a) mobility among comunas, and b) contacts reduction between individuals. Commuting
   describes the (varying) rates at which people travel among different comunas, while contacts reduction
   parameters estimate to what extent physical contacts drop in each comuna (more details in the Materials
   and Methods section).
   2.1     Effects of NPIs and Social Inequalities
   In Fig. 1A we provide an overview of mobility in Santiago during the period of study. As a proxy for
   general mobility, we consider the number of devices visiting a comuna that is different from their home
   one (see Material and Methods section). We observe a sharp drop following the first set of interventions on
   16/03. Afterwards, mobility remains fairly constant until the introduction of the full lockdown on 15/05,
   when we observe an additional ∼ 15% decrease. As we will show below, this intervention represented an
   important tipping point of the epidemic in Santiago.
       More in detail, we represent changes in commuting among comunas in Fig. 1B. The partial lockdown
   causes an average drop of about 48%, while, with the introduction of the full lockdown, commuting drops
   by 65% with respect to the baseline. For each comuna we also consider the mean percentage decrease
   in commuting after 16/03 and compare it with the Human Development Index (HDI), a coefficient that
   measures key aspects of human development, such as life expectancy, education, and per capita income
   [10]. In Fig. 1C, we observe that a greater decrease in mobility is generally associated with a higher
   HDI (Pearson correlation coefficient ρ = −0.80, p < 0.001). The same trend is observed in the absolute
   change of mobility (see the Supplementary Information) suggesting that wealthier and more developed
   comunas became more isolated after the interventions. This result is in line with previous studies that
   showed how changes in mobility patterns following government-issued interventions, and the extent to
   which people can afford social distancing, vary across different socio-demographic groups [11].

   16/03 versus HDI of different comunas. D) Scatter plot of contacts reduction parameters during partial
   (rjpartial ) and full (rjf ull ) lockdown. Dots size is proportional to the distance from the diagonal (bigger
   dots indicate comunas where contacts decreased more after the full lockdown).
        In Fig. 1D, we represent contacts reduction parameters. Across the board, contacts drop by 36%
   with the first set of NPIs policies and by an additional 11% with the lockdown. Since all points are below
   the diagonal, we conclude that, with the introduction of the full lockdown, contacts decrease further in
   all comunas. Also, the decrease is consistent with the existing reductions after the partial lockdown. In-
   deed rjpartial and rjf ull show a high significant correlation (Kendall rank correlation coefficient τ = 0.79,
   p < 0.001).

   2.2      The Spread of COVID-19 in Santiago
   We use the mobility data to develop and to inform a stochastic mechanistic metapopulation epidemic
   model (see Materials and Methods for details) and simulate the spread of COVID-19 in the comunas of
   Santiago. The model is calibrated on official surveillance data and takes as initial seeding the realistic
   projections of active cases on March 1st , 2020 in the Metropolitan area of Santiago from Ref. [7].
       We use an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach [12, 13] (see details in the Materials
   and Methods section) to find the posterior distribution of the reproductive number in Santiago (median
   R0 =2.66, 95% CI: [2.58, 2.72]), which is in line with previous findings that identify the value of R0 of
   SARS-CoV-2 to be in the range between 2 and 3 in different countries [14–16]. In Fig. 2A we report
   the number of weekly deaths projected by the model together with official figures (used for calibration).
   The two time series show a good agreement with a high correlation (ρ = 0.99, p < 0.001) and a median
   absolute percentage error of 12%. Interestingly, the agreement between data and model starts to deviate
   in the last two data points (end of July early August). We can speculate that, at least in part, this might
   be due to a lockdown fatigue. In fact, while the official restrictions were relaxed later (mid of August),
   a decrease in compliance, linked to the reduction of cases/deaths, could have taken place earlier. The
   period is outside our current data coverage. Hence, we leave testing such hypothesis to future work.
       As of August 1st , 2020, the median projected fraction of infected individuals in the area under study
   is 38.7% (95% CI: [35.1%, 41.6%]). This estimate is about tenfold the official reported figures. We are
   not aware of publicly available seroprevalence studies that we can use as a comparison and validation.
   For this reason, we can only consider qualitative evidence hinting that the Chilean outbreak has affected
   a significant fraction of the population. For example, the share of positive COVID-19 tests peaked at
   59.10% on June 18th , and in the Santiago Metropolitan Region the occupation of ICU beds reached
   almost saturation level (95%) in May. Also, a recent epidemiological study aimed at characterizing
   the first wave in Chile showed significant under-reporting of symptomatic cases (around 50%) based on
   estimates of the Case Fatality Rate [2]. Finally, previous seroprevalence studies conducted, for example,
   in the United States [17] and Spain [18], showed that the actual number of COVID-19 infections is several
   times (factors vary from 4 to 20) those reported by the official surveillance. As a sensitivity check, we
   repeated the calibration considering the upper limit of the 95% credible interval for the infection fatality
   rate from Ref. [19]. This leads to a projected median prevalence of 28.3% (95% CI: [23.5%, 32.3%]) but
   to a sensibly worse fit of the data (ρ = 0.82, median percentage error of 49%).
       Projected cases present a good significant correlation with official numbers as can be observed in
   Fig. 2B (ρ = 0.84, p < 0.001). Besides, we compare the dates when 200 infections have been reached
   in different comunas according to our model and official surveillance, finding a significant correlation
   (Kendall rank correlation coefficient τ = 0.61, p < 0.001). Similar results are found considering in-
   stead the dates when 50, 100, and 500 cases have been reached (see the Supplementary Information).
   Interestingly, the same dates estimated through modeling are much earlier, hinting that many of the
   infections in the initial phase of the spreading went unreported. In Fig. 2C we show the attack rates
   versus the HDI of different comunas. We find a strong correlation between attack rates computed on
   officially reported cases and HDI (ρ = −0.74, p < 0.001), providing evidence that wealthier comunas
   experienced significantly smaller outbreaks. In addition, the very same picture emerges from our mod-
   elling results. Indeed, simulated attack rates present a high significant correlation with HDI (ρ = −0.69,
   p < 0.001). Finally, in Fig. 2D we show the number of deaths per 1, 000 versus the HDI of different
   comunas. We find a significant correlation between HDI and both simulated (ρ = −0.50, p < 0.002)
   and officially reported (ρ = −0.40, p < 0.02) deaths, hinting that wealthier comunas experienced also
   a smaller burden in terms of casualties. We note that the correlations obtained in this case are lower
   than those found previously for the attack rates. This may be due to the interplay between diverse age
   distributions and age-dependent mortality rates. Indeed comunas with higher HDI have a higher mean
   age and the infection fatality rate for COVID-19 is significantly higher in older age brackets.
   2.3      Counterfactual Scenarios
   To assess the impact of heterogeneous responses to the spreading we run a hypothetical scenario in which
   commuting and contacts decrease uniformly across comunas, starting on 16/03. More in detail, we apply
   to all comunas the average reduction in commuting and contacts observed for the 4th quartile of HDI
   (i.e. 25% comunas with higher HDI). See the Supplementary Information for more details. According
   to our simulations, this leads to a significant decrease of cases and deaths: -83.8% (95% CI: [-77.6%,
   -88.6%]) fewer cases and -70.5% (95% CI: [-55.0%, -80.9%]) fewer deaths as of May 15th , the date when
   the full lockdown was enforced. Interestingly, the uniform reduction we are imposing implies a relatively
                                                                   4

   modest additional decrease to commuting and contacts with respect to the ones estimated through mobile
   phone data. In this hypothetical scenario, with the partial lockdown commuting rates drop by 55% and
   contacts by 49% (versus respectively the 48% and the 36% estimated in our main analysis). Although
   such homogeneous reduction across comunas is a theoretical exercise that does not consider complex
   socio-economic constraints, that go from the collective need to keep key supply chains active to the
   individual imperative to feed their own family, it crystallizes the dramatic effects of inequality on disease
   spreading on the one side, and it shows the positive benefits of equal, early, and strong responses on the

   other.
       We also use the model to investigate counterfactual scenarios aimed at estimating the impact of NPIs
   on the spread of COVID-19 in Santiago. As a first counterfactual scenario, we simulated the epidemic
   in the absence of a full lockdown. From Fig. 3A we observe that this leads on average to a 21.6% (95%
   CI: [7.5%, 41.3%]) more intense incidence peak and 34.7% (95% CI: [27.2%, 44.1%]) more deaths. To
   estimate the impact of the timing of the full lockdown, we run simulations where we anticipate or delay
   it up to four weeks. According to results in Fig. 3B, an earlier lockdown implies a less intense incidence
   peak (from around -20% to -35%). It is interesting to note, however, that a delay of 1-2 weeks has a
   very similar effect of no intervention at all in terms of incidence peak intensity. More specifically, one
   week delay causes a 18.1% (95% CI: [6.0%, 34.0%]) while two weeks delay cause a 21.6% (95% CI: [7.4%,
   41.1%]) more intense incidence peak. The timing of the full lockdown also has a significant effect on the
   number of deaths. According to our estimates in Fig. 3B, just one week of delay implies a 7.7% (95%
   CI: [1.3%, 13.7%]) increase in mortality.
   2.4     Effective Reproduction Number
   In Fig. 3C we show the evolution of the effective reproduction number Rt estimated using the method
   from Ref. [20] on the simulated and the official reported incidence. In the simulated Rt time series we
   observe the two discontinuities after the implementation of government-issued NPIs. However, we note
   that the partial lockdown had the sole effect of slowing down the epidemic. Indeed, after March 16th
   the estimated Rt is still greater than 1. After the full lockdown, instead, Rt was pushed below 1 making
   the containment possible. This is visible both in the simulated and the reported time series. This result
   underlines the importance of the full lockdown that, despite causing a relatively small effect on mobility,
   had a decisive role in bringing the outbreak under control. It is worth stressing this result. The full
   lockdown constituted a key tipping point for the evolution of the epidemic pushing the reproductive
   number below its critical threshold. A similar finding has been recently reported for the evolution
   of the pandemic in Germany [21]. Indeed, also in that context, only the subsequent compounding of
   interventions was able to bring the reproductive number below one thus curbing the spreading the virus.
   3      Discussion
   The analysis presented here shows that the effects of NPIs issued by the government strongly correlate
   with a measure of human development, such as the HDI. In particular, comunas with higher HDI were
   able to reduce more significantly their mobility. This, in turn, is reflected in both data and modeling
   estimates by a lower burden of COVID-19 (cases, deaths) in the comunas characterized by a higher
   HDI. The combination of these results raises policy-making concerns. Indeed, while lockdowns are
   unquestionably effective in mitigating the epidemic activity, they may as well augment social and health
   inequalities, penalizing more vulnerable communities. Other studies have found that mobility restrictions
   unequally affected different regions of France [8], Italy [22], United States [11], Colombia, Mexico, and
   Indonesia [23] with a higher income being associated to a larger capacity to afford social distancing.
   Furthermore, observations in the United States [11, 24–26], Singapore [27] and the UK [28, 29] show that
   socio-economic inequalities are linked to worst health outcomes during the current pandemic.
       Our data-driven analysis also shows that the timeliness of NPIs is just one variable influencing the
   outcome of the mitigation effort. The case of Santiago is emblematic. NPIs were introduced early
   respect to other countries. Only two days after the first 50 confirmed cases. For comparison, Denmark
   introduced measures after five, Austria after nine, Italy and Germany after fifteen days of reaching that
   threshold [30]. These measures were followed by a considerable reduction in mobility and contacts, but
   cases soared anyway in the metropolitan area. According to our analysis, the first set of NPIs significantly
   slowed down transmissions but not enough to stop the epidemic. It was only after the introduction of
   the second additional lockdown that the Santiago outbreak was brought under control. This indicates
   that earlier implementation of more stringent NPIs may be beneficial in quickly mitigating the outbreak
   without extending for a long time policies that potentially might unequally affect communities.
       The present work comes with limitations. First, we focused only on the epidemic evolution within
   the Santiago Metropolitan Area and we overlooked both national and international importations after
   March 1st , 2020. While it is reasonable to assume that after this date the epidemic was largely sustained
   by the internal spreading (especially considering the various restrictions on international and national
   mobility), we acknowledge this as a possible limitation. Second, compared to other approaches [31–33],
                                                                   6

   we considered a relatively simple disease dynamics. Lastly, we acknowledge that our mobile phone users’
   sample was not selected to be representative of the whole population, but we know that Telefónica
   Movistar data can well represent the different socio-demographic groups of Santiago [34].
       Overall, our study characterizes the unfolding of SARS-CoV-2 in one of the largest metropolitan
   areas in South America; a region that so far has received far less attention than others. It quantifies the
   unequal effects across communities of behavioral changes introduced by governmental measures as well
   as individual (re)actions and provides evidence that even small delays in the implementation of NPIs
   can have a significant impact on the unfolding of the epidemic.

   4      Materials and Methods
   4.1      Measuring Mobility and Contacts
   In this work, we use phone data in the form of eXtended Detail Records (XDR). This stream records
   every interaction (e.g. packet request) between devices and antennas. An entry in our dataset can be
   formalized as a tuple hd, t, ai indicating a packet request to antenna a made by device d at time t. We
   approximate the position of d with that of the antenna, which has a fixed latitude and longitude. We also
   assign a home antenna to each device by finding the most active antenna during night hours. Finally,
   we assign antennas to correspondent comunas according to their position. The dataset includes data for
   the period 2020/02/26 − 2020/06/01 for 1.4 million devices which correspond to the 22% of the total
   population in the area considered. To preserve the privacy of device owners, we analyze and display only
   anonymous and aggregated results. Furthermore, no other information about the users (i.e. gender, age
   etc..) was used nor available.
       As specified in the previous sections, we characterize the three phases of the outbreak in terms of
   commuting and contacts reduction. Commuting is measured considering the fraction of devices traveling
   between comunas. Formally, for each day t we build a commuting rate matrix Σ(t) ∈ RN ×N whose
   element σij (t) is the fraction of devices living in comuna i that visited j on day t. We average these
   daily rates during the three phases to obtain three distinct matrices describing commuting i) before any
   restrictions, ii) during the partial lockdown, and iii) during the full lockdown.
       It is important to notice that the data does not provide direct information about physical contacts be-
   tween users. Having the privacy of the users in mind, and considering the various non-trivial assumptions
   one would need to make, we do not attempt to estimate/infer such contacts. Instead, we focus on a metric
   that allows us to capture the variation before and after the various interventions. As we describe be-
   low, the epidemic model considers a homogeneous mixing approximation within each subpopulation (i.e.
   comuna) hence the only important variable is an estimate of contacts reduction rather than the actual
   contacts. To this end, contacts reduction is estimated by looking at the variation in the number of users
   co-located in the same antenna. Each antenna a in comuna j has a resident population Naj . On day t, the
   total number of visitors from the same comuna is vaj (t). Assuming                 homogeneous   mixing, the maximum
   number of contacts in antenna a is caj (t) = Naj + vaj (t) × Naj + vaj (t) − 1 /2 ∼ (Naj + vaj (t))2 /2.
   Then, we assume the reduction of contact during the partial and full lockdown to be equal to:
                                             avg       [caj (t)]                               avg [caj (t)]
                                        16/03<t<15/05                                       t>15/05
                         rapartial  =                                             rafjull =                                  (1)
                            j
                                             avg [caj (t)]                                     avg [caj (t)]
                                           t<16/03                                          t<16/03
       In other words, the reduction of contacts during the partial and full lockdown is considered as the
   variation of the maximum number of contacts before and after each intervention. Finally, we aggregate
   at the level of comunas taking the median of these quantities over all antennas located in the same
   comuna.
   4.2      Modeling the spread of COVID-19 in Santiago
   The model used in this work to simulate the spread of COVID-19 is largely inspired by the Global
   Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEAM) [35, 36]. In this section, we present the conceptual framework
   but a full mathematical description is provided in the Supplementary Information.
       The comunas of Santiago are represented as single subpopulations in a metapopulation network.
   Inside each one, we divide individuals into K = 16 five-year age brackets respecting the demographic
   of different comunas [37] and we use the country-specific contact matrix from Ref. [38] to define the
   rates at which different age groups mix with each other. Individuals are also divided into compartments
   according to their health status. We consider a SLIR (Susceptible, Latent, Infectious, Removed) com-
   partmentalization setup. A similar approach has been used in several modeling studies in the context of
   COVID-19 [7, 39, 40]. Interacting with Infectious, Susceptibles move to the Latent stage in which they
   are not infectious yet. Only after the incubation period, Latent become Infectious. Lastly, Infectious
   transit to the Removed compartment at a rate inversely proportional to the infectious period.
       Individuals can get the infection interacting with infected in their home and in other connected
   metapopulations. To model this aspect, we consider the commuting network previously introduced to
                                                                     8

   describe the coupling (i.e. the strength of connection) between comunas. Technically, we define a “force
   of infection” λkj that expresses the infection rate for individuals in age group k residing in comuna j:
                                                             λkjj       X λkji σji /τ
                                                   λkj =             +                                                       (2)
                                                         1 + σj /τ        i
                                                                            1 + σj /τ
   Where τ set the time scale of commuting (here τ −1 = 1/3 day) and σj = i σji is the total commuting
                                                                                              P
   rate of population j. In particular, the first term in Eq. 2 represents the contribute from active infec-
   tions in comuna j, and the summation from cases in other connected comunas i (see Supplementary
   Information for full details).
       Government interventions are implemented by changing the commuting network on 16/03 (partial
   lockdown commuting) and again on 15/05 (full lockdown commuting) to reflect the corresponding vari-
   ations in mobility. Similarly, on these dates, we multiply the age contact matrix of each comuna by
   rjpartial and rjf ull , respectively. We do not explicitly account for school closure since its effect is already
   included into the changes inferred from mobile devices data.
       The model is fully stochastic and transitions among compartments are simulated through chain
   binomial processes. In the main text we present results for an incubation period of 4 days and an
   infectious period of 2.5 days, which imply a generation time TG = 6.5 days, in line with current estimates
   [41, 42]. We simulate deaths considering the estimates of the Infection Fatality Rate from Ref. [19] and
   a delay ∆ after the transition to the Removed compartment.
       Initial seeding is done using the projections of active cases on March 1st , 2020 in the Metropolitan area
   of Santiago from Ref. [7] and assigning infections to different comunas proportionally to the population
   distribution. The calibration is performed on weekly deaths using an Approximate Bayesian Computation
   (ABC) Rejection method [12, 13]. At each step of the ABC algorithm, a set of parameters θ is sampled
   from a prior distribution and an instance of the model is generated using these parameters. Then, an
   output quantity E 0 of the model is compared to the corresponding real quantity E using a distance
   measure s(E 0 , E). If this distance is greater (smaller) than a predefined tolerance , then the sampled
   set of parameters is discarded (retained). After a sufficient number of iterations, the distribution of
   accepted sets will approximate the posterior distribution of parameters P (θ, E) given the evidence E
   from the data. In this work, we set a flat uniform prior on the parameters (R0 ∈ [2, 4] in steps of 0.02
   and ∆ ∈ [14, 21] days in steps of 1 day) and we perform calibration using the median absolute percentage
   error as a distance metric with a tolerance of 20% on weekly deaths. We run 140, 000 iterations which
   correspond to about 200 stochastic realizations for each possible parameters set. We use the official data
   issued by the Department of Statistics of the Chilean Minister of Health [43]. We consider both COVID-
   19 ”confirmed” and ”suspected” deaths to perform the calibration, in the Supplementary Information
   we support this decision showing that considering only confirmed COVID-19 deaths we still obtain a
   significant anomaly in mortality. Model projections are produced sampling parameter sets directly from
   the posterior distribution and generating an ensemble of trajectories. In this work we generate model
   estimates sampling 5, 000 sets on which we compute median and confidence intervals.

   A       Supplementary Information
   A.1      Sensitivity Analysis
   In this section we provide a sensitivity analysis on the data used for model calibration, on model param-
   eters, on the correlation between mobility changes and sociodemographics, and finally on the number of
   days needed to reach N infections according to our estimates and official surveillance in different comunas.
   Deaths Data for Calibration. We calibrate the model using COVID-19 deaths data issued by the
   Department of Statistics of the Chilean Minister of Health (DEIS) [43]. The dataset includes both
   ”confirmed” (i.e. supported by a clinical test, ICD code: U07.1) and ”suspected” deaths (i.e. supported
   only by symptoms, ICD code: U07.2). In Fig. 4A we compare 2020 all-cause deaths with historical
   median and 95% confidence intervals. We observe that, excluding only COVID-19 confirmed from 2020
   deaths we still obtain a significant anomaly. Excluding also suspected, instead, we obtain a trend that is
   within confidence intervals. For this reason, we decide to calibrate the model considering both COVID-19
   confirmed and suspected deaths.
       Here, we perform also calibration considering only confirmed COVID-19 deaths. In Fig. 4B we ob-
   serve that the estimates for R0 obtained in this case do not change significantly (median R0 of 2.58, 95%
   CI: [2.50, 2.64]). Moreover, this approach leads to a worse fit of the data (median absolute percentage
   error of 28% with respect to the 12% obtained considering also suspected deaths).
   Figure 4: Impact of COVID-19 on mortality rate in Santiago. A) We plot 2020 all-cause weekly
   deaths in the comunas of Santiago and the historical median with 95% confidence interval computed on
   2010-2019 data. We report also 2020 deaths time series excluding only COVID-19 confirmed (ICD code:
   U07.1) and also suspected (ICD code: U07.2) deaths. B) R0 estimates considering only confirmed and
   also suspected COVID-19 deaths.
   Incubation and Infectious Period. In the main text we considered an incubation period (TIC ) of 4
   days and an infectious period (TIF ) of 2.5 days. Here, we run simulations where we vary these param-
   eters and we observe the impact on our findings. In particular, we consider estimated R0 , prevalence
   and increase in deaths without the full lockdown for longer incubation (TIC ∈ [5, 6] days) and infectious
   periods (TIF ∈ [3, 3.5] days). In Fig. 5 we represent results of the sensitivity analysis. From Fig. 5A we
   observe that the median R0 for the different parameters explored remains in the range [2, 3]. Also, from
   Fig. 5B we note that the median projected prevalence as of August 1, 2020 in Santiago varies of at most
   5.9%. Finally, the results of the counterfactual analysis in which we do not introduce the full lockdown
   are very robust across different parameters explored. Indeed, the median projected increase in deaths as
   of August 1, 2020 varies of at most 3.0%.
   Mobility and Sociodemographics. In the main text, we showed that the change in commuting
   correlates with the Human Development Index (HDI) of different comunas. Here, we show that this
   pattern holds for other economic and development indicators too. In particular, we consider separately
   the components of the HDI, namely the Life Expectancy Index (LEI), the Education Index (EI), and the
                                                                   14

   eters explored in the sensitivity analysis. B) Model projections of prevalence in Santiago as of August
   1, 2020 for different parameters. C) Increase in deaths (in percentage) as of August 1, 2020 without the
   full lockdown for different parameters.
   Income Index (II) [10]. In Fig. 6 we see that the correlation between these indicators and the average
   commuting drop after 16/03 of the 37 comunas considered is still high, significant, and consistent with
   the results presented in the main text for the HDI.
   Figure 6: Correlation between mobility and sociodemographics. We represent the scatter plot
   and the correlations between average percentage drop in commuting after 16/03 and the Life Expectancy
   Index (LEI), the Education Index (EI), and the Income Index (II).
       Also, in the main text we showed the significant correlation between HDI and the average percentage
   decrease in commuting after March 16th , 2020. Here, we show that this finding hold also for absolute
   commuting decreases. This sensitivity check is needed since a higher percentage decrease does not im-
   ply necessarily a lower mobility after the introduction of NPIs (for example, the mobility baseline of
   wealthier comunas can be generally higher). We define the outflow as the average number of outgoing
   travels per device observed for a comuna during a given period. In Fig. 7 we represent (left) the outflow
   before March 16th , 2020 versus the HDI of different comunas. We observe no significant correlation
   (ρ = 0.01, p = 0.94). On the right, instead we represent the scatter plot of the absolute reduction in
                                                                   15

   outflow before/after March 16th , 2020 versus the HDI of comunas. In this case we find a strong, positive,
   and significant correlation (ρ = 0.55, p < 0.0001), hinting that wealthier comunas reduced more their
   mobility also in absolute terms.
   Figure 7: HDI and absolute mobility changes. On the left, scatter plot of outflow (normalized)
   before March 16th , 2020 versus HDI of different comunas. On the right, scatter plot of the absolute
   reduction in outflow after March 16th , 2020, versus HDI of different comunas. Points size is scaled
   according to population.
   Projected cases. In the main text, we assessed the performance of the model comparing via the Kendall
   rank correlation coefficient the number of days (since 2020/01/01) needed to reach 200 infections in
   different comunas according to our projections and official surveillance. We found a good, significant
   correlation and we remarked that dates estimated through modeling were generally earlier to those
   officially reported. In Fig. 8 is shown that this pattern holds also for different numbers of infections. In
   particular, we consider the amount of days needed to reach 50, 100, 200, and 500 infections.
   B       Homogeneous NPIs Effect - Counterfactual Scenario
   In the main text we present a hypothetical scenario in which we assign to all comunas the average
   decrease in commuting rates and contacts observed after the partial lockdown for the 4th quartile of HDI
   (i.e. 25% comunas with higher HDI). In Fig. 9A we represent the percentage change in total COVID-19
   deaths and cases as of 2020/05/15, date of the 2nd lockdown. We observe that the effect on the spreading
   is significant: -83.8% (95% CI: [-77.6%, -88.6%]) fewer cases and -70.5% (95% CI: [-55.0%, -80.9%]) fewer
   deaths. In Fig. 9B we represent the percentage change in COVID-19 cases as of May 15th in different
   comunas. We observe that, in general, the uniform reduction in mobility and contacts brings benefits
   also to comunas with higher HDI. This hints that a more equal distribution of behavioral responses to
   the NPIs in place would be advantageous not only for the most vulnerable but to the community as a
   whole.
   C       Metapopulation Model with Age Structure
   The model presented here is largely based on Ref. [36]. We consider N populations and K age groups.
                                                                          j
   We introduce the matrix C j ∈ RK×K whose element Ckk                     0 indicates the contacts rate between age group
   k and k in population j. Similarly, we introduce the matrix Σ ∈ RN ×N , whose element σji indicates the
            0
   commuting rate from population j to i. We consider a SLIR compartmentalization setup with traveling
   Infectious, analogous to the case described in the main text (Tab. 1). In the following, we will use
                      k
   the notation Xji      to indicate individual in age bracket k and compartment X living in population j and
   traveling to i. In these settings, we define the force of infection λkj as the probability that a susceptible
   individual in age group k and in population j transit to the Latent compartment in the unit of time.
   This force of infection has two contributions, from the contacts occurred in the home population (λkjj )
   and in other connected populations (λkji ). These can be written down as:
                                                        "                                     #

       For Xjj  (t) and Xji      (t) we can write the following rate equations:

   From Eq. 5 we derive i Xji               (t) = Xjk − Xjj    k

   When t → ∞, we obtain the equilibrium value:

   We take Eq. 7 and we impose the equilibrium condition σji Xjj                        − τ Xji  = 0. Then, substituting the
                                                                                    k
   result just derived, we obtain the equilibrium value also for Xji :

   Therefore, substituting the equilibrium values in Eq. 3 and 4 we obtain:

   Then, the total force of infection λkj can be written as the the sum of these two contributions weighted,

       Finally, we still have to give an expression to Nj∗ , the effective number of individuals in population
   j introduced in Eq. 3. This effective population must consider both the individual from j present in j
   and those traveling to j from connected populations i. Using the equilibrium values derived in Eq. 10
   and Eq. 11:

       Mobility restrictions are implemented changing the commuting matrix Σ at the start of the partial
   and the full lockdown. Contacts reduction, instead, is implemented multiplying the contacts matrix C j
   of each population (comunas) by the respective parameter. For example, the general element of the
   contacts matrix C j during the partial lockdown for comuna j is rjpartial Ckk                j
                                                                                                   0.
