               Abstract:
               Objectives: The coronavirus strain first reported in December 2019 (COVID-19) has
               spread rapidly worldwide, posing a seriously risk to human health. This meta-analysis
               aims to shed much-needed light on the relationship between COVID-19 and AKI, and
               provide a stronger evidence base to support both further research and clinical
               application.
               Methods: Two authors independently performed a literature search using PubMed,
               Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Then the incidence of AKI,
               incidence of RRT required, the mortality rate with AKI and the risk of death with AKI
               during a COVID-19 infection were statistically analyzed using Open Meta-Analyst
               software, from which conclusions are derived.
               Results: The incidence of AKI in hospitalized patients with the COVID-19 infection
               remains low, only about 3.8%; the in-hospital mortality rate with AKI in COVID-19
               infected patients reaches up to 86.8%; the odds of death with AKI in COVID-19
               infected patients is about 24.2 times higher than those without AKI.
               Conclusions: The occurrence of AKI during a COVID-19 infection should be
               considered a strong red flag with regards to the patient’s risk of death. Additional
               studies are still required to support the conclusions derived herein and to explore the
               AKI mechanism during a COVID-19 infection.

               1. Introduction
               Starting in December 2019, a specific strain of the coronavirus disease was reported
               (named COVID-19). It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
               coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exhibiting an unbelievable level of infectious
               distribution and resulting in high mortality rates worldwide [1]. According to the
               WHO, SARS-CoV-2 infections outside of China continues to increase rapidly; by
               April 20 2020, there have been 2,314,621 laboratory-confirmed cases and 157,847
               confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 in over 150 different countries [2]. There are still
               no specific treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 at present, and as COVID-19 is a
               novel virus, developing our understanding of the virus is essential in establishing
               effective treatments.
                      The SARS-CoV-2 is identified as a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus
               belonging to the β-coronavirus cluster, mainly causing community-acquired
               pneumonia in humans [1]. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms during
               infection [3]. Epidemiological data pertaining to COVID-19 thus far remains limited,
               with early studies focused on describing the clinical characteristics and severe cases.
               Recently, a growing body of evidence suggests that there is a common presence of
               acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 patients, including in patients who ultimately
               died [4-6]. Meanwhile, other studies [1,7] have cited AKI as only a rare incident
               during COVID-19 infections. More robust evidence is urgently needed to resolve
               clinical confusion and dispute. In addition, the effects of the COVID-19 infection on
               renal function still remain unclear and requires urgent exploration. This meta-analysis
               aims to investigate the authentic incidence rates of AKI during COVID-19 infections.
               By pooling the available data from relevant and valid publications, it aims to confirm
               whether COVID-19-related AKI has an impact on mortality or not.

               2. Materials and Methods
               2.1. Search Strategy
                      The protocol for this meta-analysis was registered with the International
               Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO ID. CRD42020181188). A
               systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, Embase,
               and Cochrane Library from March 01 to May 04, 2020 (inclusive) to summarize the
               data of AKI on COVID-19 infected patients. The systematic literature search was not
               executed on any preprint databases to ensure the reliability of the final statistical
               results. Two authors (ZX.M. and L.C.) independently carried out systematic literature
               searches employing the terms “acute kidney” OR “acute renal” AND “coronavirus
               2019” OR “novel coronavirus” OR “COVID 19” OR “2019 nCoV” OR “SARS 2”
               OR “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” OR “nCoV disease” OR
               “coronavirus disease 2019”. Each study was then evaluated for inclusion in or
               exclusion from this analysis. No language restrictions were applied. Publication date
               restrictions were applied from January 2020 up until May 04, 2020 (inclusive). A
               manual search for references cited in the articles found was also performed. The
               meta-analysis was conducted and handled according to the guidelines of the Preferred
               Reporting          Items      for   Systematic        Reviews      and     Meta-Analyses      (PRISMA).
               (http://www.prismastatement.org/).
               2.2. Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria
                      For the meta-analysis presented herein and for our AKI definition, eligible studies
               reporting the AKI or AKI-related indicators of patients infected with COVID-19 were
               considered. Studies which met the Population, Interventions, Comparison and
               Outcomes (PICO) criteria were included in the meta-analysis.

                      All the studies selected fulfilled the following criteria, namely that original cohort
               studies provided: the necessary clinical characteristic data during COVID-19
               infections; incidences of AKI requiring/not requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT)
               among COVID-19 infected patients; specific AKI-related indicators (hematuria,
               proteinuria, or serum creatinine) of COVID-19 infected patients are reported. All
               potentially eligible studies are considered for enrollment regardless of our AKI or
               RRT definition. All COVID-19 infected patients enrolled in this study were identified
               and confirmed as infected via nucleic acid detection by a laboratory.
                      Cases with a history of chronic kidney diseases pre-COVID-19 infections where
               it is impossible ascertain post-infection AKI in the original report were excluded; case
               or case series reports containing less than 10 patients were excluded; duplicate articles
               were excluded; reports from the National Health Commission were excluded in order
               to avoid repeated data.
               2.3. Data Extraction and Study Quality
                      A data collecting spreadsheet (Excel: Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) was
               created to analyze the following data from each included study: the first author, data
               collection period, region/hospital, number of patients, number of AKI/RRT patients,
               AKI-related indicators, AKI-related deaths. No attempts were made for specific or
               missing data from the authors. Due to the fact that some reports come from the same
               hospitals, and in order to prevent overlapping data, the duration and hospital were
               especially specified.
                      All included studies were assessed regarding their quality using the
               Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) containing three aspects
               (selection, comparability and outcomes) and eight items [8]. Scores range from 0 to 9,

               where studies with a score             ≧  6 were considered as meeting adequate methodological
               quality.
               2.4. AKI and RRT Definitions
                      RIFLE (the Risk of renal failure, Injury to the kidney, Failure of kidney function,
               Loss of kidney function and End stage kidney disease), AKIN (the Acute Kidney
               Injury Network), and KDIGO (the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) were
               the three major criteria to define AKI [9.10]. In this meta-analysis, AKI incidents were
               accepted regardless whether the original studies had been defined according to one of
               the guidance frameworks cited above; RRTs were accepted as the original studies
               have recorded the RRT used regardless of modality.
               2.5. Statistical Analysis
                      Open Meta-Analyst software (for Windows 10 version; Brown University,
               Providence, USA) was utilized for the statistical analysis. In this analysis, random
               effects models and the DerSimonian-Laird method were applied to analyze the pooled
               incidence of AKI, the incidence of RRT required, the mortality rate with AKI (ratio
               variables), and the risk of death with AKI (dichotomous variables) during COVID-19
               infection; the pooled odds ratio (ORs) was used to analyze the risk of death with AKI;
               all the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were evaluated; an I2 test was used
               to assess heterogeneity due to probability variance among observational studies; these
               results are graphically presented using forest plots. Statistically significant
               heterogeneity among studies was defined as χ2P value < 0.05 or I2 test > 50%; a P value
               of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

                      The flowchart of the systematic review with selection process and reasons for
               exclusion are demonstrated in detail in Figure 1. A total of 61 records were identified
               from 4 databases (PubMed, n= 27; Web of Science, n= 7; Embase, n= 27; Cochrane
               Library, n= 0). After duplicates were excluded (32 records), 29 articles were screened
               through titles and abstracts manually, in order to establish eligibility. Then, in-vitro
               studies, animal studies, case reports, review articles, letters, comments, and erratums
               were excluded. The 18 remaining articles were full-text reviewed for eligibility. The
               cited references of the remaining articles were also screened through titles. The
               studies containing < 10 patients or insufficient clinical data and were subsequently
               excluded. Finally, 12 cohort studies involving 5,448 patients who fulfilled the
               pre-specified criteria were included in the meta-analysis (see Table 1). Four studies
               (33.3%) with a score            ≧  6 were considered to be of high quality according to the NOS
               criteria (Table 2) (as follow-up outcomes data were not available).
               3.2 Characteristics of Included Studies
                      The data collection period of enrolled studies is between December 16, 2019 and
               April 04, 2020. Seven studies (58.3%) reported the outcomes with clearly-defined
               AKI according to KDIGO. Eight studies (66.7%) reported RRT being required during
               COVID-19 infection and almost all of these used continuous renal replacement
               therapy (CRRT). Five studies (41.7%) clearly reported the outcomes with numbers of
               AKI-related deaths, while one study gave the hazard ratios (HR) between AKI and
               in-hospital deaths.

                      Overall, 600 patients developed AKI during the COVID-19 infection, the pooled
               estimated incidence of AKI during COVID-19 infection being 3.8% (95% CI: 1.7% -
               8.1%, P < 0.001, see Fig. 2), and a significant heterogeneity (I2 = 95.58%, χ2P < 0.001)
               was observed. Subgroup analysis was performed according to different AKI-defined
               criterion. The pooled estimated AKI incidences in the KDIGO subgroup analysis and
               none-defined (N/A) subgroup analysis are 4.6% (95% CI: 1.8% - 12.2%, I2 = 96.14%,
               χ2P < 0.001, P < 0.001) and 2.2% (95% CI: 0.4% - 13.9%, I2 = 91.08%, χ2P < 0.001,
               P < 0.001) respectively (see Fig. 2). There still remains significant heterogeneity
               following our subgroup analysis (data obtained by NS Chen [12] and XB Yang [13],
               duplicates from D Wang [14,19] were not calculated on two occasions).
               3.4 Incidence of RRT Required during COVID-19 Infection
                      The following meta-analysis showed that 100 patients required RRT during the
               COVID-19 infection, the pooled estimated incidence of RRT required being 2.2%
               (95% CI: 1.0% - 4.6%, P < 0.001, see Figure 3), and a significant heterogeneity (I2 =
               81.28%, χ2P < 0.001) is also observed among the eligible studies (data obtained by T
               Chen [3]and YC Cheng [6] were not calculated on two occasions).
               3.5 The Mortality Rate with AKI and the Risk of Death with AKI during COVID-19
               Infection
                      The last series meta-analysis reveals that 421 patients died with AKI during their
               COVID-19 infection, the pooled estimated mortality rate with AKI being 86.8% (95%
               CI: 72.1% - 104.4%, P = 0.133, see Fig. 4a), with a significant heterogeneity also
               being observed among the eligible studies (I2 = 96.01%, χ2P < 0.001). The odds of
               death with AKI in COVID-19 infected patients is estimated to be 24.2 times higher
               than patients without AKI (OR, 24.2; 95% CI: 7.32 - 80.26, P < 0.001, I2 = 65.64%,
               χ2P = 0.02, see Fig. 4b), indicated that AKI was a strong risk factor for death.

               Subgroup analysis was performed due to different patients enrolled original studies.
               We could see that there was no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, χ2P = 0.45, see Fig. 4b)
               observed in the three studies which conducted by enrolling all death and discharged
               patients, as well as being consistent with the overall results (OR, 18.6; 95% CI: 14.8 -
               23.41, P < 0.001, see Fig. 4b). These results also pointed that further studies should
               carried out with clearly identifying variables patients.
               4. Discussion
                      This population-based meta-analysis provides much-needed evidence that the
               incidence of AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections is low, at only
               about 3.8%. However, the appearance AKI during COVID-19 incidences infection
               should be recognized by clinical practitioners as a strong warning sign: the in-hospital
               mortality rate with AKI in COVID-19-infected patients is much greater, reaching as
               high as 86.8%; the odds of death with AKI in COVID-19-infected patients is
               extremely high, about 24.2 times higher than those without AKI.
                      The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2
               (ACE2), and would be activated and cleaved by cellular transmembrane serine
               proteases (TMPRSSs), leading to a release of fusion peptides, thus fusing with the
               host cells membrane [20]. Accordingly, the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSSs are
               key factors in determining the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. One study,
               which is heavily based on analysis of normal kidney cells, indicates that ACE2 and
               TMPRSS genes exhibited high co-expression in podocytes and proximal straight
               tubule cells, which play critical roles in urine filtration, reabsorption and excretion
               [21]. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),

               about 80% of COVID-19 infection cases are mild in symptoms and outcomes, while
               14% of patients experience severe infection, and 6% patients deteriorate to become
               critically ill [22]. As SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly first established via an induced
               respiratory tract infection, the duration and accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the
               circulatory system is likely to be a key mechanism by which to attack extrapulmonary
               organs, including the kidneys. Once extrapulmonary organs dysfunction manifests,
               such as in the kidneys, it can be inferred that a large number of viruses have replicated
               in the patient, with the effect that multiple organs are or will be attacked
               simultaneously. Moreover, a pathologic dysregulated host response with a
               hyper-inflammatory cytokine storm [23] combines to precipitate critical illness in
               patients, increasing the probability of death. Thus, the difference of infection duration,
               the various stages of the infection, and the inconsistent host conditions may together
               cause different AKI incidences and mortality rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. A
               time-dependent, anti-viral approach to treatment arguably needs to be focused upon,
               however, this is beyond the scope of this present meta-analysis. Nonetheless, renal
               function and the urine output of COVID-19 patients should be monitored early and
               frequently as a matter of course.
                      Recently, some studies have proposed a mechanism named “organ crosstalk”,
               implying that the impaired function of one organ is communicated to the dysfunction
               of other organs and is subsequently mediated among each other via complex
               mechanisms in critical illness [24,25]. AKI is one of typical examples involving
               multiple organ interactions [24,25]. AKI incidents associated with acute respiratory

               distress syndrome (ARDS) with variations of lung-kidney interactions have been
               identified [25]. It may act as an initiated incident or an aggravated factor via multiple
               mechanisms, including blood gas disturbances, renal congestion due to pulmonary
               hypertension,          and       hormone       dysregulation       [25].     In     addition, mechanical
               ventilation-induced haemodynamics alternation and lung injury may amplify the
               conditions and exacerbate pre-existing or recently developed end-organ injury.25 As
               previously mentioned, no vaccine or specific anti-viral drugs for COVID-19 has yet
               been shown to be effective. At present, supportive treatments to ease the symptoms
               and to prevent multi-organ dysfunction in severe COVID-19-infected patients have
               been prescribed, which means executing interventions with the inevitable sacrifice of
               renal function (such as chloroquine phosphate). AKI might be considered as an
               inevitable clinical syndrome in these patients similar to like other critically ill patients,
               as over 50% of those would develop Stage 1 AKI at some point during their ICU
               course [26].
                      The present study provides a much-needed evidential basis for AKI incidence
               among COVID-19 patients, but has several limitations. First, there remains a limited
               amount of original studies (< 10) by which to evaluate the risk of death with AKI
               during COVID-19 infection. Nonetheless, considering the potential of this research in
               advancing our understanding of COVID-19 and in supplying medical practitioners
               with evidence-based recommendations, and in light of the current global pandemic
               emergency, the authors took the decision to present these findings forthwith. Second,
               there is a statistically significant heterogeneity in the meta-analysis for AKI incidence.
               11

               Potential origins for significant heterogeneity may come from different COVID-19
               infection stages. As performed via subgroup analysis according to AKI definitions, the
               results still reveal a significant heterogeneity. Future heterogeneity exploration must
               rely on the acquisition of more original clinical data. Finally, since the clinical data
               collection is based upon publications with limited availability, extra investigations
               could not be made but should be considered (infection duration, drugs used,
               geography, ethnicity, and age group in particular). Nevertheless, AKI incidence with
               COVID-19 infections must demand greater attention. Further studies are still urgently
               needed to support the conclusion herein and explore the AKI mechanism within a
               COVID-19 infection context.
                      Although the chance of AKI during COVID-19 is rare, it is a dangerous incident
               for these patients compare to those without AKI. Unfortunately, demographics of
               these patients in this meta-analysis are not possible to include. For example, we can
               not get the overall data of AKI in asymptomatic patients, who have neither fever nor
               respiratory tract symptoms, usually with good prognosis, yet the pathophysiological
               process of renal function changing even minor alternations of them should be worth
               for exploring.
                      Since mentioned the treatment of COVID-19 patients, there is also nearly no
               effective drugs directly targeting COVID-19 at present, which is similar to AKI.
               Prevalent prescription focused on antiviral activity including both the western
               medicine (lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, arbidol, and chloroquine) and traditional
               Chinese antiviral medicine, that are equally missing effective and safe evidence from
               multi-center, randomized controlled and double-blind studies. Usually, it would take
               quite a long time from in vitro experiments to actual clinical application for any
               12

               medicine. However, the nephrotoxicity of the drugs above-mentioned are already
               proved for many years. In addition, for critical illness patients infected by COVID-19,
               strengthened pharmaceutical care or antiviral treatment might be inevitable thereby
               often conducted. As there are lack of real effective drug to prevent or cure kidney
               damage during the early stage of this complex lung-kidney interactions process, renal
               function/urine output frequently monitored should be carried out, together to apply
               drugs with low nephrotoxicity where possible, accordingly to reduce potential or
               actual drug problems once virus detection verified, based on the conclusions of this
               meta-analysis.
                      The reason of establishment this meta-analysis is not only to generalize the
               dangerous of AKI during COVID-19, but also to provide suggestions for making
               treatment decisions. The antiviral effect of COVID-19 medicine should not be the
               only judging criteria. According to the complex mechanisms of AKI during
               COVID-19 and its relationship to the risk of death, further exploring of new
               COVID-19 targeting drugs could not only limited to the antiviral effect, the
               anti-inflammatory (anti-IL-6, anti-TNF-α, and so forth.) ability should also be one of
               consideration for the new drugs development. The second treatment solution may be
               powerful antiviral drugs combined with anti-inflammatory drugs especially for critical
               patients, due to the possibility of those medicine playing important roles in
               neutralizing the impact of cytokine storm, reducing the incidence rate of AKI, finally
               decreasing and the mortality rate of critical patients.
                      In conclusion, the occurrence of AKI during a COVID-19 infection should be
               paid greater attention, and should be considered a strong red flag with regards to the
               patient’ s risk of death. Additional studies are still required to support the conclusions
               derived herein and to explore the AKI mechanism during a COVID-19 infection. The
               following fields should be emphasized for the reduction of mortality related AKI
               during COVID-19: (1) Strengthen epidemiological research, especially the prevention
               13

               and control of critical cases with AKI; the renal function of asymptomatic and mild
               cases should be frequently monitored, carried out blood purification treatment if
               necessary; (2) Conduct in-depth research on mechanisms of renal injury during
               COVID-19 attack (various signal pathways/virus proteins) for designing of blocking
               drugs; (3) Explore the combined application of antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs
               in the design of clinical trials for COVID-19, further study is needed on the standard
               application, the evaluation for the curative effect, and the integration of them together.
               Finally to ameliorate the effectiveness of treatment, as well as to achieve the goal of
               reducing mortality patients infected with COVID-19.
