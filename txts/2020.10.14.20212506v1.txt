  ABSTRACT

  Background

  Exposure to fine particulate matter and black carbon is related to cognitive impairment and

  poor lung function, but less is known about the routes taken by different types of air pollutants

  to affect cognition.

  Objectives

  We tested two possible routes of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC) in

  impairing cognition, and evaluated their importance: a direct route over the olfactory nerve or

  the blood stream, and an indirect route over the lung.

  Methods

  We used longitudinal observational data for 31232 people aged 18+ from 2006 to 2015 from

  the Dutch Lifelines cohort study. By linking current and past home addresses to air pollution

  exposure data from ELAPSE, long-term average exposure (≥ ten years) to PM2.5 and BC was

  calculated. Lung function was assessed by spirometry and Global Initiative (GLI) z-scores of

  forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were calculated.

  Cognitive performance was measured by cognitive processing time (CPT) assessed by the

  Cogstate Brief Battery. Linear structural equation modeling was performed to test the

  direct/indirect associations.

  Results

  Higher exposure to PM2.5 but not BC was directly related to higher CPT and thus slower

  cognitive processing speed [18.33 (×10-3) SD above the mean (95% CI: 6.84, 29.81)]. The

  direct association of PM2.5 constituted more than 97% of the total effect. Mediation by lung

  function was low for PM2.5 with a mediated proportion of 1.78% (FEV1) and 2.62% (FVC),

  but higher for BC (28.49% and 46.22% respectively).

  Discussion

  Our results emphasize the importance of the lung acting as a mediator in the relationship

  between both exposure to PM2.5 and BC, and cognitive performance. However, higher

  exposure to PM2.5 was mainly directly associated with worse cognitive performance, which

  emphasizes the health-relevance of fine particles due to their ability to reach vital organs

  directly.

  INTRODUCTION

  Air pollution contributes substantially to the global burden of disease; it is responsible for 4.2

  million deaths, about 8000 deaths per year in Europe (Lelieveld et al. 2019), and for 103.1

  million lost years of healthy life globally in 2015 (Cohen et al. 2015).

            There is also recent evidence that exposure to air pollution is associated with lower

  cognitive performance (Zhang et al. 2018) and a higher incidence of dementia (Carey et al.

  2018). A cohort study from Germany investigated the relationship between air pollution and

  cognitive functioning as well as local brain atrophy measured by magnetic resonance imaging

  (Nußbaum et al. 2020). In this study, higher exposure to PM2.5 and PM2.5 absorbance was related

  to lower cognitive functioning, and higher PM2.5 was additionally associated with local brain

  atrophy. A double-cross over experiment suggested that short-term exposure to PM2.5 had

  adverse effects on cognitive functioning measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination

  (MMSE) (Shehab and Pope 2019). A prospective cohort study among older Chinese adults,

  which also measured cognitive performance by using the MMSE, found that each 10-μg/m3

  increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 5.1% increase in the risk of poor cognitive functioning

  (Wang et al. 2020). In the US, a doubling in BC level was related to 1.57 times higher odds of

  low MMSE scores (Colcino et al. 2017). A study, which explored the relationship between

  exposure to different constituent of PM2.5 and cognitive functioning among older Puerto Rican

  in the US, found that long-term exposure to BC, nickel, sulfur, silicon, and PM2.5 in general

  were related to slower mental speed or decreased recognition (Wurth et al. 2018).

            Although, we know more about the negative effects of particulate matter on cognitive

  performance, the exact routes by which air pollutants may unfold their neurotoxic effects have

  barely been tested empirically, and there are substantial gaps in the knowledge of the

  underlying causal mechanisms (Griffiths and Mudway 2018). Commonly, two hypotheses are

  discussed (Block and Calderón-Garcidueñas 2009).


                                                                 4

            First, air pollutants may damage the brain directly by entering through the olfactory

  nerve or the lung, with subsequent entry into the blood stream providing access to the brain

  (Figure 1, path 1). It is mainly very fine particles which are assumed to follow this route

  (Block and Calderón-Garcidueñas 2009; González-Maciel et al. 2017).

  Second, air pollutants may enter the lung by inhalation, thus impairing lung function or

  causing pulmonary inflammation (Figure 1, path 2). After inhalation, especially fine particles

  can penetrate the deepest parts of the lung, e.g. the alveoli, due to their small size (Sturm

  2020; Xing et al. 2020). Impaired lung function may cause lower (abnormal) blood oxygen

  levels (hypoxemia) leading to systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, cerebral arterial

  stiffness and small-vessel damage (Lutsey et al. 2018). Air pollutants also cause inflammatory

  responses of immune cells residing in the lung, e.g. pulmonary macrophages, thereby adding

  to or causing a substantial systemic presence of inflammatory mediators (Guarnieri and

  Balmes 2014).

            In accordance with this second hypothesis, previous research showed that ambient air

  pollution is a major health risk contributing substantially to respiratory mortality (Lelieveld et

  al. 2019), and air pollution is related to lower pulmonary function (Adam et al. 2015), higher

  COPD prevalence (Bloemsma et al. 2016), higher asthma prevalence (Zheng et al. 2015),

  higher lung cancer mortality (Dimakopoulou et al. 2014), and a higher burden of COPD

  (Cohen et al. 2015). But, the negative effect of small particulate matter on lung function,

  however, is still contested. A meta-analysis of five cohorts in the European Study of Cohorts

  for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) observed that higher levels of NO2, but not of PM10 and

  PM2.5, were associated with lower levels of forced expiratory flow in one second (FEV1) and

  forced expiratory flow (FVC) among adults (Adam et al. 2015). On the contrary, the

  Framingham Heart Study found that also relatively low levels of PM2.5 were related to lower

  FEV1 and FVC, and an accelerated decline in lung function (Rice et al. 2015). For Black

  Carbon (BC), there is evidence from a women’s cohort from Boston, Massachusetts, that
                                                                 5

  higher levels of BC were associated with decreased lung function in terms of FEV1 and FVC

  (Suglia et al. 2008).

            Although the hypothesized direct and indirect pathways taken by inhaled air

  pollutants, there are hardly any cohort studies which explored the interrelations between air

  pollution, lung function and cognition. To our knowledge, only one cohort study exists that

  explored the mediating role of FEV1 and FVC in cognitive impairment caused by long-term

  exposure to NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 (Hüls et al. 2018). However, this study observed just a

  small, female cohort in Germany and did not find any significant mediation by lung function.

  But it showed that there was a total effect/ a general relationship in the way that higher

  exposure to fine particulate matter was related to poor cognitive performance.

            Due to the existing lack of research in exploring the interrelation between air

  pollution, lung function and cognition, this new cohort study has thus two objectives. First, it

  empirically tests the hypothesized routes taken by fine particulate matter in general (PM2.5)

  and Black Carbon (BC), which is, next to the ultrafine particles (UFP), a major component of

  PM2.5., to impair people’s cognitive performance. Second, it evaluates the importance of the

  found routes in impairing cognition.

  METHODS

  Study Population and Design

  We explored data from the Netherlands, a low pollution setting, and used longitudinal

  observational data for people aged 18+ from 2006 to 2015 from the Dutch Lifelines cohort

  study. Lifelines is a multi-generational prospective cohort study on multifactor risks for

  diseases, which recruited about 10% of the population in the three provinces of the Northern

  Netherlands, from whom 110,908 adults had a baseline and a follow-up assessment

  (Scholtens et al. 2015). Current and past residential addresses of each participant were

  obtained from municipal administration data. The Lifelines Cohort Study is conducted

  according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and is approved by the medical

  ethical committee of the University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands.

            In our study design, we tackled the issue of correct causal time order between the

  cause (exposure to fine particulate matter), mediator (lung function) and outcome (cognitive

  performance) of interest. For this purpose, we distinguished between three time periods. The

  first time period is the time up to baseline for which the air pollution exposure data over a

  minimum of ten years through the 31st of December of the year before baseline were

  calculated for each participant. The second time period is the baseline (2006-2012), at which

  the participants were recruited for the Lifelines cohort study and the lung function was

  measured. And the third time period is the follow-up (2014-2015), at which the participants’

  cognitive performance was assessed.

            All participants aged 18+ with data available on residential addresses over a minimum

  of ten years through the 31st of December of the year before baseline, with valid air pollution

  exposure data, a valid lung function measurement at baseline (2006-2012), and a valid

  measurement of cognitive performance at follow-up (2014-2015) were included

  (Supplementary Figure S1). Our final sample size was 31232 people (see Supplementary

                                                                 7

  incomplete data).

  Outcome Assessment: Cognitive Performance Measured by Cognitive Processing Time

  (CPT)

  To measure the participants’ cognitive performance in our follow-up period (2014-2015), we

  used the Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB), which is an age-specific validated standardized

  computerized tool to measure four domains of cognitive performance: psychomotor speed,

  visual attention, visual learning, and working memory (Lim et al. 2013). Other studies have

  used CBB to detect (mild) cognitive impairment (Maruff et al. 2009).

            The CBB in Lifelines comprises four card tasks in the space of 11 minutes, reflecting

  the four cognitive domains: detection (2 min), identification (2 min), visual learning and

  memory (5 min), and working memory (2 min). Each task displays a textual instruction screen

  with a description of the task requirements. Each consists of several exercises (e.g. related to

  speed or accuracy) to be solved by selecting the “Yes” or “No” buttons on the screen (Lim et

  al. 2013).

            Clinical practice has shown that the cognitive processing speed, defined as the ability

  to process information rapidly, is closely associated with the ability to solve (complex)

  cognitive tasks (Lichtenberger et al. 2013) and is thus one of the most important domains of

  cognitive performance (Salthouse and Ferrer-Caja 2003). Accordingly, we obtained a speed

  composite score using the speed measures from detection, identification and working memory

  task as primary outcomes in consultation with the Cogstate research team.

            Each speed measure reflects the mean time for correct responses in each domain and

  was log (10)-transformed for better normality. For each of the three speed measures, we

  calculated z-standardized scores for the age groups: 18-34, 35-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-90,

  90-99. A composite score measuring the overall cognitive processing time (CPT) was then

                                                                 8

  computed by averaging the z-standardized speed scores of the three tasks. The final composite

  score was then z-standardized again. Positive scores mean that people had higher CPT (slower

  speed) and thus worse cognitive performance, and negative scores that they had lower CPT

  (faster speed) and thus better cognitive performance when compared to the mean. To control

  our cognitive speed outcome (CPT) for the accuracy of responses given, we accounted for

  age-standardized proportion of correct trials and the total number of trials per participant in

  the three CBB domains we used.

  Exposure Assessment: Fine Particulate Matter and Black Carbon

  We used exposure data on two ambient air pollutants available in the Lifelines dataset:

  particulate matter (PM) of particulates with diameters of 2.5 µm and smaller (PM2.5) and the

  black carbon (BC) proportion in the PM2.5. The exposures were estimated by Lifelines using

  air pollution models developed in the project “Effects of Low-Level Air Pollution: A Study in

  Europe” (ELAPSE) (see de Hoogh et al. 2018 for a detailed description). In brief, satellite-

  derived and chemical transport model estimates were used to develop fine spatial scale land

  use regression (LUR) models for Western Europe for 2010. PM2.5 concentrations were derived

  from the European Air Quality Database (AirBase v8) and BC annual means from the

  monitoring campaign conducted in the “European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects”

  (ESCAPE) (Eeftens et al. 2012). The developed LUR models in ELAPSE for all included

  sites explained 62% of the variance PM2.5, whereas for BC 54% was explained.

            To assess an individual’s long-term exposure to PM2.5 and BC up to our baseline

  period, we linked the current and past home addresses of the individuals to the average annual

  concentrations for PM2.5 and BC for that address for 2010 coming from the LUR developed in

  ELAPSE. For this purpose, we/lifelines used the Municipal Personal Record Database

  (Zijlema et al. 2016) that contains the home addresses and thus the geolocations of all

  individuals who live or have lived in the Netherlands so that residential mobility and length of

                                                                 9

  exposure can be traced. For each air pollutant and individual, we calculated time-weighted

  average (𝑇𝑊𝐴) concentrations by weighting the average exposure concentrations (𝑐𝑖 ) of a

  residential location in 2010 with the duration of residence at a specific location (exposure

  time of the data) (𝑡𝑖 ) (Cohen et al. 1996).

  Mediator Assessment: Lung Function

  Lung function at baseline (2006-2012) was assessed by Lifelines through spirometry,

  performed by trained medical staff according to American Thoracic Society guidelines using

  a Welch Allyn Version 1.6.0.489 PC-based SpiroPerfect with CardioPerfect workstation

  software. We used two volume measures, the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)

  and the forced vital capacity (FVC), as outcome variables. To come up with interpretable

  scores, we used age-, sex-and height-specific reference values for FEV1 and FVC as provided

  by the Global Lung Initiative (GLI) (Quanjer et al. 2012). Subsequently, the predicted

  proportion of the empirical lung function scores compared to the predicted reference scores

  were calculated for all both lung function measures. Scores beyond 100% mean that people

  had better lung parameters compared to the reference values, whereas scores lower than 100%

  mean that they had worse.

  Assessment of Potential Confounders

  We controlled for age, sex, socio-demographic and lifestyle confounders, and respiratory and

  cognition-related diseases at baseline (2006-2012). Education level was defined as the highest

  education level completed (none, primary, lower secondary vocational, secondary vocational,

  senior general secondary, higher vocational, university, other). Income was measured by an

  individual’s net income per month (less than 1500 Euro, between 1500 and 2500 Euro, higher

  than 2500 Euro, unknown/ unexpressed). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the

  individual’s measured weight divided by measured height square and categorized in one of


                                                                10

  three groups: less than 25, between 25 and less than 30, and equal to or higher than 30.

  Hypertension was operationalized by a systolic pressure higher than 139 mmHg or a diastolic

  pressure higher than 89 mmHg. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured by

  medical staff. Prevalence of respiratory diseases, namely asthma and COPD, as well as

  cognition-related diseases, namely multiple sclerosis, depression, diabetes (type I or II), and

  stroke, was derived by a question whether a doctor has ever diagnosed that specific disease in

  participants before (yes/ no). Pack-years of cigarettes smoked (1 pack-year = 20 cigarettes per

  day/ 1 year) were calculated from the baseline questionnaire collecting data on a person’s

  smoking history. Additionally, we controlled for the province of residence at baseline

  (Drenthe, Groningen, Friesland, other) and the total time period to which the long-term

  exposure to air pollution applied.

  Statistical Analyses

  We used mediation analysis to explore whether the association between air pollution (X) and

  CPT (Y) followed a direct route to the brain or was mediated by lung function (M). We

  performed linear structural equation models (SEM) without feedback loops and with robust

  standard errors by Huber/ White (Breusch-Pagan-Test, p < 0.001). Exposure and confounders

  were treated as exogenous variables, and lung function as well as CPT were seen as

  endogenous variables. We introduced an outcome equation (equation 1) and a mediator

  equation (equation 2), whereby 𝐶𝑛 denote the specific confounding variables, and 𝜃0 to 𝜃𝑛 ,

  and 𝛽0 to 𝛽𝑛 are the unobserved parameters (see also Supplementary Figure S2 for the

  model approach):

                                                                11

            We estimated the two equations simultaneously and performed subsequently a

  decomposition of the total effect (the following usage of the words total, indirect or total

  effect does not imply causality; terms represent standard technical terms) 𝑇𝐸 = 𝛽1 + 𝜃1 + 𝜃2

  into a direct effect 𝐷𝐸 = 𝜃1 and the two separate indirect paths (𝛽1, 𝜃2 ). The both indirect

  path coefficients can be combined into one indirect effect 𝐼𝐸 = 𝛽1 × 𝜃2 (Gunzler et al. 2013).

  To test the significance of the indirect effect (𝐼𝐸) we used the delta method/ Sobel Test (Sobel

                                                                                  (𝜃1 )

                                                                                1 +𝜃1 +𝜃2 )

  effect and indirect effect compared to the total effect. The significance threshold was .05 and

  all tests were 2-sided. The calculations were performed using Stata MP 13.1.

            We performed three kinds of sensitivity analyses. First, we checked the robustness of

  our SEM approach to ensure that our results were valid. We applied causal mediation analysis

  using a potential outcome approach with bootstrapping (1,000 iterations) for inference

  evaluation. Causal mediation analysis was performed by using the “mediation” package in

  Stata, which is based on the “mediation” package for causal mediation analysis in R (Tingley

  et al. 2014).

            Second, we estimated SEMs for study participants aged 45 because the air pollution

  effects on cognitive performance are assumed especially evident for those ages when

  cognitive decline has generally started (Singh-Manoux et al. 2012).

            Third, we used the average air pollution concentrations from ELAPSE at the baseline

  residential address only to check whether our sample selection confined to participants with

  historical addresses of at least ten years available biased the results.

  RESULTS

  Characteristics of the Study Participants

  Of the 31232 participants 16103 (51.56%) had faster Cognitive Processing Time (CPT) and

  15129 (48.44%) slower CPT than the mean at follow-up (2014-2015) (Table 1). The average

  daily exposure to PM2.5 was 14.95 [min = 9.58, max = 20.12] µg/m³, and 1.25 [min = 0.65,

  max = 2.34] µg/m³ to BC (Figure 2). The average time for which migration history and the

  linked air pollution data from ELAPSE at historical home address was available was 8567.56

  days (23.46 years). For lung function, the average FEV1 was 3.55 liters (96.62% predicted)

  and FVC 4.60 liters (100.69% predicted) (Table 1).

            There were 14895 (47.69%) people who had zero pack-years of cigarettes smoked,

  suggesting that they were never-smokers, and the smokers had an average of 10.93 pack-

  years. The body mass index of 112254 (39.24%) participants indicated they were overweight

  (BMI ≥ 25), and 3952 (12.65%) were obese (BMI ≥ 30). 7.43% of the participants had

  prevalent asthma at baseline diagnosed by a doctor, 4.30% COPD, 6.58% diabetes, 10.11%

  depression, and 0.45% had ever a stroke before. Age at baseline ranged from 18 to 85 and the

  average age was 43.95 years.

  Associations between Air Pollution Exposure and Cognitive Processing Time (CPT)

  First, we estimated the total effect showing the overall associations between long-term air

  pollution exposure up to baseline and CPT at follow-up (2014-2015). We found that higher

  exposure to PM2.5 was significantly related to slower CPT and so worse cognitive

  performance [18.33×10-3 SD above the mean (95% CI: 6.84, 29.81)] (Figure 3,

  Supplementary Table S1). We additionally estimated adjusted CPT predictions for the

  values of PM2.5 from the minimum integer value (9) to the maximum (20) value under our

  model assumptions (Supplementary Figure S3). This showed that up to an average exposure

  level of 15µg/m³ [0,87×10-3 SD above the mean (95% CI: -9.78, 29.81)] no effect of PM2.5, on
                                                                13

  CPT was seen. From an average value of 16µ/m³ [18.67×10-3 SD above the mean (95% CI:

  2.82, 24.92)] onwards, however, PM2.5 had an adverse effect on cognition and was associated

  to slower (values > 0) z-standardized CPT. For BC, however, no significant associations

  existed.

  Mediation Analysis and Decomposition of the Total Effect into the Direct and Indirect

  Effect

  Second, we conducted a decomposition of the total effects into a direct and an indirect effect.

  The direct effect represents the direct route of air pollutants through the olfactory nerve or the

  lung, with subsequent entry into the blood stream, providing access to the brain. The direct

  effects for PM2.5 on CPT were seen even when we controlled for both lung function measures

  at baseline (2006-2012), so the indirect routes, namely for FEV1 [18.00×10-3 SD above the

  mean (95% CI: 6.51, 29.49)] and FVC [17.85×10-3 SD above the mean (95% CI: 6.35,

  29.34)]. No significant direct effects were found for BC (Figure 4).

            The indirect effect represents the indirect route of air pollutants, which first impair the

  lung, which in turn leads to worse cognitive performance. For PM2.5, we observed mediation

  by both lung function measures, namely for FEV1 [0.33×10-3 SD above the mean (95% CI:

  0.04-0.22)] and FVC [0.44×10-3 SD above the mean (95% CI: 0.06-0.90)] (Figure 4 and see

  Supplementary Table S1 for the estimation parameters of 𝛽1, 𝜃1 and). We also found

  indirect effects for BC, namely for both lung function measures (FEV1: [1.74×10-3 SD above

  the mean (95% CI: 0.29, 3.20); FVC: [2.83 (95% CI: 0.51, 5.15)].

            Our first sensitivity analysis using g-formula supported our results and showed that

  our model approach came to nearly the same estimations (Supplementary Table S2). The

  second sensitivity analysis including participants aged 45 and older only (see Supplementary

  Table S4 for descriptive statistics) showed also same results than the all-participant model in

  line with our hypothesis (Table 2). However, we did not find an indirect effect of PM2.5 by

                                                                14

  FEV1 due to a lack of significance. In the third sensitivity analysis, we used the average

  concentrations of PM2.5 and BC at residential address of participants at baseline only (see

  Supplementary Table S4 for descriptive statistics), and we found same results as in our

  model with time-weighted average concentrations over at least ten years before baseline

  (Table 2). This showed that our sample selection procedure and the inclusion of participants

  with at least ten years of residential address history available did not bias the results.

            By calculating the importance of direct and indirect effects, we found that about 98%

  (FEV1) or 97% (FVC) of the total effect of PM2.5 was directly associated with cognitive

  performance. The highest indirect effect proportions were seen for BC (FVC, 46.22%) and the

  lowest indirect effect proportion was seen for PM2.5 by FEV1 (1.78%) (Figure 5).

  The influence of Confounders on the Associations between Air Pollution and Cognitive

  Performance

  Turning to the covariates included in our study, we found that age was not correlated with

  cognitive function [-0.05×10-3 SD below mean (95% CI: -1.17, 1.07)] indicating successful

  age-standardization of our outcome of interest, CPT. As expected, higher educated people had

  better cognitive performance [-503.26×10-3 SD below mean (95% CI: -733.03, -273.50)] than

  participants without any educational level. We further found that prevalent diabetes was

  related to poor cognition [-99.12×10-3 SD below mean (95% CI: -54.12, -144.12)]. The other

  morbidities showed no significant effect. Furthermore, women fared worse than men [-

  68.78×10-3 SD below mean (95% CI: -91.34, -46.22)].

            We found, as expected, that participants with prevalent COPD [FEV1: -6.87%

  predicted (95% CI: -7.71, -6.04); FVC: -3.36% predicted (95% CI: -4.06, -2.66)] and asthma

  [FEV1: -4.54% predicted (95% CI: -5.11, -3.97); FVC: -1.13% predicted (95% CI: -1.64, -

  0.63)] had worse lung function. But also diseases, which were not directly related to

  respiratory health, were associated with worse lung function, namely stroke [FEV1: -4.43%

                                                                15

  [FEV1: -0.70% predicted (95% CI: -1.28, -0.13); FVC: -1.21% predicted (95% CI: -1.76, -

  predicted (95% CI: -1.57, -0.80)].

            We additionally found that lower income, a higher number of packyears and obesity,

  but not a lower educational level, were associated with lower FEV1 and FVC. We observed

  that higher age was related to both higher FEV1 and FVC indicating that the age-

  standardization by the GLI reference values was not fully successful and an additional

  inclusion of age in our models was important to avoid confounding by age. For sex, however,

  we found no association with lung function confirming that the sex-standardization was

  successful.

  DISCUSSION

  Summary of the Findings

  To the best of our knowledge, our cohort study is one of the first to demonstrate the

  importance of the direct and the indirect route over the lung taken by inhaled fine particulate

  matter in general and Black Carbon in particular in cognitive impairments for both genders.

            In the low pollution setting of the Netherlands, higher exposure to PM2.5 was

  associated with slower cognitive processing time at follow-up (2014-2015) among

  participants aged 18+, and associations were also evident in a sensitivity model including

  participants aged 45 and older. Further analyses showed that an average PM2.5 exposure level

  of 16 to 20 µg/m³ was significantly related to worse age-standardized cognitive performance,

  whereas people experiencing only 9 to 14 µg/m³ on average had better cognitive performance.

  By decomposing the total effects into a direct and an indirect effect respectively, we showed

  that PM2.5 was directly related to slower cognitive processing time and, thus to worse

  cognitive performance. This direct effect constituted more than 97% of the total effect of

  PM2.5 on cognitive performance when we included mediation by lung function at baseline

  (2006-2012) in our model. In addition to the direct effect, there was also small significant

  indirect effects for both lung function measures FEV1 and FVC contributing just about 2 to

  3% to the total effect.

            For BC, the associations were solely mediated via lung function. We found significant

  indirect effects, which contributed about 28% (FEV1) to 46% (FVC) to the total effects. Both

  mediations however, were too small to translate significance to the total effect since there

  were insignificant direct effects which contribute (partially) to the total effect as well.

            As most important covariates/ confounders, we identified educational level and

  diabetes prevalence for cognitive performance, and prevalence of COPD, asthma, stroke,

  diabetes, and hypertension as well as income and packyears for lung function.

                                                                17

            The main aim of this study was to test the two hypothesized routes taken by fine

  particulate matter in general (PM2.5) and Black Carbon (BC) as one of the main components

  of the fine particulate matter. Our results indicate that the direct route may be more important

  for PM2.5 and the indirect route for BC.

  Interpretation and Comparison of the Findings

  Turning to the interpretation of our findings, our results suggest that BC may not be able to

  cross the direct route to reach the brain among participants aged 18 and older. Previous

  research has, in contrary to our results, found that higher exposure to BC was related to worse

  cognitive functioning (Colcino et al. 2017; Wurth et al. 2018). These studies, however,

  included people aged 60 and older only. An explanation could be that older people (≥ 65 years

  old), who are more vulnerable and fragile, are more prone to the negative effects of air

  pollution (Shumake et al. 2013; Simoni et al. 2015) than younger people.

            We found that PM2.5, however, may affect cognition directly. It is known that fine

  particles, e.g. PM2.5 and especially ultrafine particles (diameter < 0.01µm), a component of

  PM2.5 as well, are potentially able to penetrate the central nervous system, resulting in

  subsequent neuroinflammation (Maher et al. 2016). We further know that microglia may be

  activated by the direct route, but also upon occurrence of systemic neuroinflammation

  (Widmann and Heneka 2014). In vivo and in vitro studies also provide insights into the

  neurotoxic effect of PM exposure; i.e., higher levels of PM are linked to significantly higher

  levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin, as well as tumor necrosis factor and

  glial responses indicating the presence of inflammation (Kilian and Kitazawa 2018). In turn,

  neuroinflammation is an important risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, e.g.

  Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (Glass et al. 2010; Heneka et al. 2015; Sarlus and

  Heneka 2017). Another possibility is that the pollutants inhaled reach the brain via the lung,

  which provides the initial entry to the body, and then pass from the alveoli into the

                                                                18

  bloodstream, using circulation to reach the central nervous system (CNS) (Lee and Shah

  2018). We further know that exposure to PM2.5 is associated with DNA methylation, which

  may in turn affect lung function or/ and brain health negatively (Shi et al. 2019).

            Additionally, we found evidence for the relevance of the indirect route over the lung in

  cognitive impairments by fine particulate matter. That is, PM2.5 to a small extent and BC to a

  greater extent affect cognitive performance by first impairing the lung function and

  subsequently leading to cognitive impairment. For BC, this seemed to be the main route in our

  study to unfold adverse cognition effects, since we found that the effect of BC on cognitive

  performance was solely mediated by FEV1 and FVC with a mediated proportion of 28 to 46%

  and we found no evidence that BC is able follow the direct route. Previous studies have also

  found that higher exposure to BC and PM2.5 are associated with lower FEV1 and FVC (Guo et

  al. 2018; Lepeule et al. 2014), and inflammatory processes in the lung, oxidative stress and

  activation of microglia cells resulting in subsequent neuroinflammation have been suggested

  as causal pathways (Guarnieri and Balmes 2014). However, the fact that the found mediated

  proportion is only 28 to 46% for BC suggests that there are potential additional routes missed

  in our study, e.g. cardiovascular health/ diseases, which could be relevant in impairing

  cognition by BC. We know accordingly from previous research that higher exposure to BC

  was related to adverse cardiovascular outcomes (Gan et al. 2011). In turn, another study has

  found that better cardiovascular health was related to better cognitive health (Kulshreshtha et

  al. 2019).

            Our study was conducted in the low-pollution setting of adults aged 18+ in the

  Netherlands. For PM2.5 (14.95 µg/m³), the exposure level was clearly lower compared to the

  relatively restrictive EU-wide limit values (25 µg/m³ for PM2.5) (Guerreiro et al. 2018), and

  also lower compared to previous epidemiological cohort studies (ECRHS, 16 µg/m³; EGEA,

  15 µg/m³; E3N, 15 µg/m³; SALIA, 18 µg/m³; SAPALDIA, 17 µg/m³) (Jacquemin et al. 2015).

  This was also true for BC, which was 1.25 µg/m-1 in our study, but 1.5 µg/m-1 or higher in
                                                                19

  other cohorts (ECRHS, 2.0 µg/m-1; EGEA, 2.1 µg/m-1; E3N, 1.8 µg/m-1; SALIA, 1.5 µg/m-1;

  SAPALDIA, 1.9 µg/m-1) (Jacquemin et al. 2015). Higher exposure levels in other spatial units

  or countries may result in even stronger associations between air pollution and cognition than

  what is demonstrated in this study’s population, under the assumption of a non-linear, e.g

  exponential, dose-response relationship. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous

  study which evaluated the dose-response relation between fine particulate matter and

  cognitive performance among adults, so that more research is needed here.

  Strengths and Limitations

  Our study has several strengths. First, we did not only explore the overall relationship (total

  effect) between fine particulate matter and cognitive performance as done by previous

  research (Power et al. 2011; Wurth et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018), but additionally performed

  a decomposition of the total effects in order to disentangle the potential routes taken by the air

  pollutants, which are closely related to causal mechanisms/ pathways. For this purpose, we

  applied a causal mediation approach by using SEM. To the best of our knowledge, the only

  previous cohort study that explored the mediating role of lung function was not able to find

  any significant indirect effects (Hüls et al. 2018), potentially because they observed only a

  small female cohort in Germany. The adverse total effect of PM2.5 they observed, however,

  supports our results.

            Second, we calculated time-weighted average concentrations over a minimum of ten

  years up to baseline to measure the long-term exposure to air pollutants. Using one-year

  concentrations only, as done in previous studies (Colcino et al. 2017; Nußbaum et al. 2020;

  Wang et al. 2020; Wurth et al. 2018), may confound the results by unobserved positive health

  selection into living environments with low exposure levels (Oakes 2014), even when our

  third sensitivity model showed that this is not true in our study.



                                                                20

            Third, we used a standardized and multidimensional (composite) outcome variable,

  cognitive processing time (CPT), which was computed in close contact with the Cogstate

  research team, to measure the participants’ cognitive performance. The speed measures

  coming from the CBB may be summarized into a composite, also used to determine the

  overall cognitive performance and not only to detect clinical abnormalities. Previous studies

  mostly used the MMSE as an outcome to measure mild cognitive impairment, e.g. when

  MMSE scores were ≤ 25 (Colcino et al. 2017; Shehab and Pope 2019; Wang et al. 2020).

  This, however, has a relative lack of sensitivity when detecting subtle cognitive impairments

  (Proust-Lima et al. 2007) and detailed differences in cognitive performance within a specific

  population.

            Fourth, a series of sensitivity analyses confirmed our results. (1) A replication analyses

  using g-formula and bootstrapping method for testing the causal routes (Supplementary

  Table S2), yielded similar results to our SEM approach. (2) This was also true for the analysis

  of individuals aged 45 and older only, which gives even more plausibility to our results,

  because previous research suggested that cognitive decline starts from the mid-40s (Singh-

  Manoux et al. 2012). (3) Using one-year air pollution concentrations at baseline only, did not

  change our results underlining that our sample selection procedure of including individuals

  with a residential history of ten years only did not bias our findings.

            Despite the important strengths of our study, there are some limitations. First, ambient

  air pollution concentrations at the residential address, especially those estimated by land use

  regression models, do not reflect the overall air pollution people are indeed exposed to in their

  living environments. People are also exposed to (potentially different) air pollution levels,

  which are relevant for brain health, during daily road travel or when they are indoor (Saenz et

  al. 2018). Second, we used the air pollution exposure data from the ELAPSE project, which

  seems to have better quality than previous data (de Hoogh 2018). But, the data were only

  available for the year 2010 and these data from 2010 were linked to the participants address
                                                                21

  history, so that the calculated average long-term exposure concentrations at home used in this

  study just act as a proxy for the real air pollution dose participants experienced in their

  surroundings. We feel however, that our way to handle the data should deliver at least better

  results than using annual concentration from one year at baseline only. Third, we analyzed

  only the levels of health and not the changes in health over time, which suggests generally

  more causal explanatory power. We, however, minimized the effect of this limitation by

  ensuring correct causal time order between cause, mediator and outcome. Furthermore, we

  included only those participants for whom exposure data was available for at least ten years,

  and verified our results by performing causal mediation analyses with a potential outcome

  approach (see our first sensitivity analysis). Fourth, we were not able to account for genetic

  factors, e.g. the apolipoprotein-ε4 allele (APOE-ε4), which are known to be the most

  prevalent genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (Miyata and Smith 1996), and whose

  variants modify the association between air pollution and cognitive impairment resulting in a

  stronger air pollution effect for APOE risk variant carriers (Schikowski et al. 2015). Fifth, our

  models assumed a linear dose/-response relationship between air pollution exposure and

  cognitive performance. In doing so, we followed previous studies in the field, which explored

  e.g. the dose-response relationship between PM2.5 and daily deaths (Schwartz et al. 2002),

  PM2.5 and daily respiratory deaths (Ren et al. 2017), prenatal exposure to PM2.5 and

  development of brain white matter and cognition in later childhood (Bradley et al. 2015),

  which all identified a linear relationship. However, there is also evidence for the existence of

  non-linear relations between PM2.5 and mortality due to respiratory disease (COPD, lung

  cancer, lower respiratory infection), especially for lower concentrations below 25 µg/m³

  (Cohen et al. 2017).

  Conclusion

  Our study provides new insights in the association between ambient exposure to fine

  particulate matter and brain health by disentangling underlying direct and indirect pathways

  over lung function. Our results emphasize the importance of the lung acting as a mediator in

  this relationship. Especially BC seems to impair the lung or activate inflammatory responses

  of immune cells residing in the lung, causing subsequent cognitive impairments. Thus, brain

  health seems to depend on, among others, a good lung function, and lung function in turn may

  benefit from low air pollution exposure. Fine particles as PM2.5 seem to mainly follow the

  direct route, which calls for a special attention to fine particles due to their ability to reach

  vital organs directly. Future research is needed that explores, beside of the indirect lung

  function route found in our study, further pathways taken by inhaled air pollutions to

  subsequently affect cognition.

Table shows the decompositions of the Total Effects of the associations between long-term time-weighted air pollution (in µg/m³) up to baseline and
Cognitive Processing Time (CPT) measured by the Cogstate Brief Battery. The direct (Direct Effect) and the indirect (Indirect Effect) routes over
the lung function measures FEV1 and FVC (potential mediators) at baseline (2006-2012) were modelled simultaneously by performing g-formula
method using bootstrapped standard errors (1,000 iterations). Illustrated were the point estimators and confidence intervals coming from single
models for each air pollutant, controlled for sex, age, province of residence, educational level, income, pack-years of cigarettes smoked,
hypertension, asthma, COPD, diabetes, depression, stroke, multiple sclerosis, BMI, the age- and z-standardized CBB accuracy, and the total number

Figure 1. Routes Taken by Inhaled Fine Particles to Cause Subsequent Cognitive Impairments (source: authors’ drawing)




Mainly smaller air pollutants (fine particles) may damage the brain directly by entering through the olfactory nerve or the lung, with subsequent
entry into the blood stream providing access to the brain (path 1). Air pollutants may also enter the lung by inhalation, thus impairing lung function

                                                                          39

or causing pulmonary inflammation (path 2). Impaired lung function may cause lower (abnormal) blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia) leading to
systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, cerebral arterial stiffness and small-vessel damage. Air pollutants also cause inflammatory responses of
immune cells residing in the lung, e.g. pulmonary macrophages, thereby adding to or causing a substantial systemic presence of inflammatory
mediators.

particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon proportion (BC). Lung function data b) are shown by spirometry measure, namely the forced expiratory
volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the forced volume capacity (FVC). c) shows the data of the cognitive processing time (CPT). Higher values indicate
slower CPT and worse cognitive performance, and lower values faster CPT and better cognitive performance.
