               Abstract
               Aim: To further explore the association between Transmembrane 6 superfamily
               member 2 (TM6SF2) rs58542926 T/C gene polymorphism and hepatic fibrosis.
               Materials and Methods: In this study the MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and
               CENTRAL databases were queried from inception to March 21, 2020. According to
               inclusion and exclusion criteria               ， case-control    studies assessing the relationship
               between TM6SF2 rs58542926 T/C gene polymorphism and significant liver fibrosis
               were selected. NOS scale was used to evaluate the included literature. Stata 12.0
               software was used for data analysis.
               Results: In this meta-analysis              ，a total of 7 articles, including 2286 patients were

               included. Statistical analysis showed that the TM6SF2 gene polymorphism was
               associated with significant liver fibrosis in the allele contrast, recessive dominant
               models (T vs. C, OR=1.292, 95%CI 1.035-1.611, P=0.023; TT vs. CT+CC, OR=2.829,
               95%CI 1.101-7.267, P=0.031). No significant publication bias was found after
               Egger’s test.
               Conclusion: The present findings suggest that the TT genotype and T gene of
               TM6SF2 rs58542926 T/C gene polymorphism are associated with susceptibility to
               significant hepatic fibrosis.

                 Introduction
                     Liver fibrosis is abnormal hyperplasia of the liver connective tissue caused by
               various pathogenic factors. Untreated liver fibrosis eventually leads to cirrhosis and is
                                                                                                                        [1,2]
               associated with an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)                                 .
               The most common causes of liver fibrosis are viral hepatitis C or B, alcohol abuse,
                                                                                                 [3]
               schistosomiasis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)                         . Yet, it still remains
               unclear whether the genetic factors aggravate the formation and development of liver
               fibrosis.
                     TM6SF2 is a gene located on chromosome 19, which encodes a segment of
                                                                     [4]
               protein consisting of 351 amino acids                     . Yet, considering that the current data are
               contradictory, its function remains unknown.                        Yang-Lin et al confirmed that

               TM6SF2 is associated with histologically defined nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
               (NAFLD) and discovered that TM6SF2 serves as a powerful modifier of hepatic
               fibrogenesis and influences hepatic fibrosis progression in patients with non-alcoholic
               fatty liver disease [5]. More recently, Zheng-Tao et al [6] conducted a meta-analysis and
               found that TM6SF2 rs58542926 T/C gene polymorphism was associated with the
               genetic susceptibility to hepatitis C virus (HCV) related hepatic fibrosis. However,
               Wong et al suggest that the TM6SF2 variant probably does not cause severe liver

               injury from NAFLD                  . In order to further clarify the relationship between TM6SF2
               rs58542926 gene polymorphism and significant liver fibrosis, we conducted this
               meta-analysis.
               Materials and Methods
               The current meta-analysis complied with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic

               TM6SF2 rs58542926 T/C gene polymorphism with significant liver fibrosis published
               from inception to March 2020. The following key search terms and their potential

               6 superfamily member 2 OR TM6SF2”. The last literature search of the above
               databases was completed on March 21, 2020.
               Study selection
               The relevant articles were initially selected by reading the title and abstract. Two
               authors reviewed the full texts to select qualified articles based on set eligibility
               criteria. Any disputes during the selection process were discussed and resolved by a
               third investigator.
               Inclusion and exclusion criteria
                      Inclusion criteria were the following: (1) the study cohorts included TM6SF2
               rs58542926 T/C gene polymorphism in patients with significant liver fibrosis or
               cirrhosis and control individuals; (2) the included literature had clear criteria for
               staging of liver fibrosis or the diagnosis of cirrhosis; (3) case-control study and the
               control group included normal or non-significant liver fibrosis population; (4) if
               duplicate research reports of the same author or the same population were retrieved,
               then the complete data were selected for combined analysis to avoid duplicate
               statistics. (5) observation index: TM6SF2 rs58542926 T/C gene polymorphism
               frequency distribution; (6) the full text could be retrieved in different ways.
                      Exclusion criteria were: (1) the unclear source of enrolled cases in the article or
               lack of control group; (2) no clear criteria for the staging of liver fibrosis or the
               diagnosis of described cirrhosis; (3) unscientific or inappropriate data collection and

               analysis methods; (4) lack of detailed genotyping data; (5) no-case-control study; (6)
               animal research experiments; (7) literature that does not conform to the
               Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).
               Assessment of evidence Quality
               The Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality and risk of bias in
               case-control studies. This scale judges three general areas: a selection of study groups,
               comparability of groups, and the factor of exposure. We assessed the quality of
               evidence from the relevant studies for each outcome.
               Data extraction
               Two experienced authors independently extracted the necessary data and information
               from eligible publications according to a predetermined data extraction form. The
               information extracted from all the selected studies included: first author's surname,
               publication year, a country in which the study was conducted, age, body mass index
               (BMI), grading criteria for liver fibrosis or diagnostic criteria for cirrhosis, the
               numbers of cases and controls with the C/C, C/T, and T/T genotypes. Whether
               genotype distribution was consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)
               was also recorded.
               Risk of bias
               Egger's test was employed to assess publication bias. A P<0.05 was considered to be
               statistically significant.

               Statistical analysis
               According to the requirements of Meta-analysis, a unified spreadsheet was designed
               to extract, sort, and transform the data, and the sorted data were rechecked with the
               original literature. Stata 12.0 software was used for data analysis. The association of
               the T/C polymorphism in the TM6SF2 gene with significant liver fibrosis was
               evaluated by calculating pooled odds ratios (ORs) alongside 95% confidence intervals
               (CIs) in the allelic, dominant, recessive, and super-dominant models. The HWE for
               each study was measured by the χ2 test, and P>0.05 was regarded as consistent with
               the HWE. The random or fixed-effects model was used to pool ORs based on
               heterogeneity assumption. Heterogeneity across studies was determined by the Q- and
               I2 tests. The fixed-effects model was used in the case of nonsignificant heterogeneity
               (P>0.05, I2<50%); otherwise, the random-effects model was utilized. In order to
               explore the effect of a single study on overall results, a sensitivity analysis was
               performed by removing one study sequentially to evaluate its effect on the overall
               results under all genetic models.
               Results
               Search results
               There were 225 relevant studies compliant with the strategy, of which 68 were
               excluded as duplicates. After further review of the title and abstract, 65 reports were
               excluded as irrelevant to this meta-analysis. The second round of the evaluation was
               based on a careful full-text review of the 92 retained papers. Then, 85 reports were

               Characteristics of the included studies
               Table 1 describes the basic features of all seven included studies. A total of 719
               patients with significant liver fibrosis (case group) and 1567 patients without
               significant liver fibrosis (control group) were included. Genotyping data for all studies
               are summarized in Table 2. The vast majority of reports used TaqMan assays for
               genotyping. The assessed individuals were mostly Europeans and Asians.

               Meta-analysis results
               Seven studies included in the current meta-analysis described the association of
               TM6SF2 rs58542926 T/C gene polymorphism with significant liver fibrosis. The
               allelic (T vs. C), dominant (CT+TT vs. CC), recessive (TT vs. CT+CC), and
               super-dominant (CC+TT vs. TC) models were assessed. The fixed-effects model was
               employed for pooled ORs since nonsignificant heterogeneities were detected in allelic,
               dominant, and recessive models. In the super-dominant model, heterogeneity was
               significant, treatment: (1) conducted sensitivity analysis found that the results of this
               study were robust, (2) subgroup analysis was performed according to age and sample
               size. The results showed that age and sample size were not the source of heterogeneity
               (Table S1). Therefore, the random effect model was employed for pooled ORs. The
               sources of heterogeneities were considered as follows: (1) the source of each study
               population was not completely the same, and there were few data on population in
               some areas, this subgroup analysis was not performed, considering that different
               populations may be the source of heterogeneity; (2) the BMI and grading criteria of
               hepatic fibrosis or diagnostic criteria of cirrhosis distribution of each study population
               were not the same, which may also be the source of heterogeneity. This meta-analysis
               found that the TT genotype and T gene of TM6SF2 E167K gene polymorphism were
               associated with susceptibility to significant hepatic fibrosis.

               The CT+TT genotype as the exposure factor and the CC genotype as the
               non-exposure factor were analyzed. A total of 132 and 587 cases had the TT+CT and
               CC genotypes in the case group, respectively. Meanwhile, 228 and 1339 cases had the
               TT+CT and CC genotypes in the control group, respectively. The results showed that
               the pooled risk of significant liver fibrosis was not significantly different in the
               TT+CT genotype compared with the CC genotype (CT+TT vs. CC, OR=1.257;

               The T allele was used as the exposure factor and the C allele as the non-exposure
               factor. There were 142 cases with the T allele and 1296 with the C allele in the case
               group, and 235 T allele and 2899 C allele cases in the control group. We found that

               genotype among cases. Meanwhile, 7 and 1560 cases had the TT and CC+CT

                     The results of subgroup analysis according to sample size in the super-dominant
               model (CC+TT vs. TC) suggested no interaction between sample size >200 groups
               and sample size ≤200 group (OR=1.163, 95% CI0.569-2.379, p=0.678). The sample
               size was not the source of heterogeneity (Figure S2).
                     Subgroup analyses, according to age in the super-dominant model (CC+TT vs.
               TC), were also conducted. The 95% CI of the two subgroups (Mean age (yr) >50 vs.
               Mean age (yr) ≤50) overlapped, the p-value of the subgroups was greater than 0.05
               (OR=1.309, 95% CI 0.430-3.983, p=0.636). So, it was considered that there was no
               interaction between the subgroups, i.e., age was not the source of heterogeneity
               (Figure S3).
               Sensitivity analysis
               Sensitivity analysis was performed by sequentially omitting one study so as to
               examine its effect on the overall results under all genetic models. In the four genetic
               models of TM6SF2 rs58542926 T/C, OR values obtained after eliminating any one of
               the studies were close to pre-exclusion ORs, indicating the robustness of the current
               analysis (Figures S4-7).
               Publication bias
               Egger's funnel plots showed no publication bias in the four genetic models, including
               the dominant (CT+TT vs. CC, P=0.267), allelic (T vs. C, P=0.497), recessive (TT vs.
               CT+CC, P=0.582) and super-dominant (CC+TT vs. TC, P=0.540) models (Figures

                      Discussion
                     According to the subcellular localization analysis, TM6SF2 is mainly expressed
                                                                                         [4]
               in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi body intermediate                          and is polymorphic. The
               polymorphism of TM6SF2 rs58542926 refers to the substitution of thymine T for
               normal cytosine C in the nucleotide no. 499 of this gene, resulting in the substitution
               of glutamic acid (Glu) at no. 167 by lysine (Lys). This amino acid substitution of
               TM6SF2 rs58542926 (glutamate negatively charged and lysine positively charged)
               produces an unstable protein that reduces the secretion of very-low-density
               lipoprotein-mediated neutral fats (triglycerides and cholesterol esters) from
               hepatocytes, resulting in lipid droplet accumulation and increased levels of
               triglyceride in liver cells, which, in turn, cause severe fibrosis or cirrhosis [16, 17].
                     Although studies on the relationship between TM6SF2 rs58542926 T/C gene
               polymorphism and the risk of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis have attracted the attention
               of many researchers, different studies have reported contradictory results. Since single
               studies tend to have a small sample size, this might affect the stability and reliability
               of reported research results. A meta-analysis is a valid, scientific, and objective way to
               evaluate and combine results from different studies.
                     In this study, through the formulation of search strategies, data screening, and
               data extraction, seven documents that met the requirements were finally included in
               the meta-analysis. The data of TM6SF2 rs58542926 T/C gene polymorphism and

               significant liver fibrosis at different locations and at different times were combined
               and analyzed. We then evaluated whether TM6SF2 rs58542926 T/C gene
               polymorphism was associated with significant liver fibrosis and what was the strength
               of the correlation. The TM6SF2 E167K gene was analyzed for a dominant gene
               model, an allele model, a recessive gene model, and a super dominant gene model.
               The results suggested that the TT genotype and T gene of TM6SF2 rs58542926 T/C
               gene polymorphism were associated with susceptibility to significant hepatic fibrosis.
               This is consistent with the results of a meta-analysis conducted by Zheng-Tao et al [6]
               who found that TM6SF2 rs58542926 T/C gene polymorphism was associated with the
               genetic susceptibility to HCV related hepatic fibrosis, and the T allele at 499 was
               positively correlated with the susceptibility to hepatic fibrosis, suggesting that this
               allele may be a risk factor for hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
               However, Zheng-Tao and his team only studied the relationship between this gene
               polymorphism and hepatitis c-related liver fibrosis, but did not explain the association
               between other causes of liver fibrosis and this gene polymorphism. Besides, they only
               investigated the recessive gene model. In this meta-analysis, we further explored the
               relationship between TM6SF2 rs58542926 T/C gene polymorphism and significant
               liver fibrosis, including HCV and other reasons causing significant liver fibrosis. In
               addition, more gene models were analyzed (recessive gene, a dominant gene, gene,
               super dominant genetic model); thus, making the results more representative. The
               inconsistent results may be explained by a variety of reasons. A meta-analysis can
               search for evidence as possible to analyze this difference and solve the controversial

               issue. But, a meta-analysis must not subjectively exclude research, and try to control
               and analyze various biases in order to improve the authenticity and reliability of
               meta-analysis results. This study was conducted in accordance with the requirements
               of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale to evaluate the quality of the literature, excluding
               uncontrolled, unclear diagnostic criteria, and duplicate reports. Publication bias is one
               of the critical factors influencing the results of a meta-analysis. The Egger linear
               regression results of this study suggested that there was no obvious publication bias in
               the literature included in this meta-analysis.
                     The study has some limitations. Firstly, single-factor research was involved, and
               the interaction of TM6SF2 E167K gene polymorphism with environmental factors
               and multi-gene linkage were not included; the interaction of environmental factors
               and multi-gene linkage can affect the susceptibility to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.
               Secondly, due to the limited number of articles included, this meta-analysis failed to
               cause of disease and BMI for group discussion. Thirdly, the classification criteria for
               liver fibrosis included in this study differed. In addition, there may be slight
               differences in the definition of significant liver fibrosis. The result of subgroup
               analysis, according to fibrosis criteria, was not reliable because of few papers
               included in this meta (Table S1). Finally, the included literature mainly analyzed the
               relationship between TM6SF2 E167K gene polymorphism in the European population
               and significant liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. There are relatively few related studies
               from other countries and races. Therefore, this meta-analysis cannot be generalizable
               to all regions or ethnicities. The analysis also makes it impossible to compare the

               Conclusion
                     This meta-analysis suggests that the TT genotype and T gene of TM6SF2
               rs58542926 T/C gene polymorphism are associated with susceptibility to significant
               hepatic fibrosis.
