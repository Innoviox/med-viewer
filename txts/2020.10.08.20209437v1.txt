 9     Abstract
10     The COVID-19 pandemic has been a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, with
11     evidence suggesting that activities involving heavier breathing, such as singing and exercise, can
12     result in increased risk for disease transmission. The USA Curling Club Nationals is a week-long
13     curling tournament to determine the men’s and women’s club-level champions. The 2020
14     tournament took place March 7-14 at the Potomac Curling Club in Laurel, MD, and featured
15     teams from across the United States. Preventative measures, such as increased cleaning and
16     disinfection of surfaces, single use and disposable food containers, and canceling traditional
17     event banquets were implemented. Despite these measures, players, coaches, officials,
18     volunteers, and spectators contracted the virus as a result of participation in the event. We
19     surveyed participants to assess total positivity, potential days of transmission, and the burden of
20     symptoms experienced among the participants. We found that 55.6% of all participants reported
21     experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, with nearly all experiencing more than one
22     symptom. Although most participants’ symptoms resolved quickly, 9.6% of all participants
23     experienced symptoms for at least one month and 12.6% of all participants reported taking at
24     least 30 days before they felt they had returned to normal. As a result of this study, we believe
25     curling tournaments have the potential to be high-risk events for the transmission of COVID-19.
26     Further infection prevention measures that were not yet publicly implemented at the time of this
27     tournament may be an effective method of lowering transmission risk, although further research
28     is required.
                                                                          2

29     Introduction
30     The Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in the deaths of
31     greater than 200,000 United States citizens and over 1 million deaths worldwide (1). Transmitted
32     through the inhalation of droplets containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerging evidence
33     suggests that the virus may spread through both large droplets that fall to the ground quickly and
34     small droplets that stay suspended in the air longer that may travel greater distances (2). Multiple
35     epidemiological reports have been published by the US Centers for Disease Control and
36     Prevention (CDC) establishing that certain types of activities result in increased spread of
37     COVID-19. Perhaps the most well-known study is that of a 61 person choir where 32 members
38     were confirmed and 20 were likely infected (3), likely due to the indoor nature of the event and
39     the increased number of droplets released due to singing. Gym environments where heavier
40     breathing results in the release of more droplets have also been shown to act as areas of high risk
41     (4). Recently, mask use has been shown to be one important factor to preventing the spread of
42     infection (5) along with other preventative measures.
43     The USA Curling Club Nationals is a weeklong curling tournament to determine the men’s and
44     women’s club-level champions. The event is organized and sanctioned by the USA Curling
45     Association (USCA). Men’s and women’s teams from each of the 10 regional curling
46     associations compete in a round robin tournament followed by playoffs to decide the champions.
47     The 2020 Club Nationals were held at the Potomac Curling Club in Laurel, Maryland, from
48     March 7-14, with teams from the states of Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey,
49     Minnesota, Michigan, Washington, North Dakota, and Wisconsin. In an effort to reduce the
50     chance of contracting COVID-19 during the tournament, many changes in practice were made
51     that were thought to be effective at that time in the pandemic. These changes included cleaning
                                                                          3

52     of surfaces and rock handles between uses, encouraging use of hand sanitizer, and limiting use of
53     cups and snacks to single-use disposable options. Major event changes included canceling the
54     opening ceremony, offering a limited closing banquet, and discouraging the traditional pre- and
55     post-game handshakes. Although self-limited in gathering size by nature, an official order
56     limiting gatherings larger than 250 people was not put into effect by the state of Maryland until
57     March 12, 2020 (6). On March 18, 2020, the USCA informed participants, volunteers, and
58     spectators that an individual who participated in the tournament had tested positive for COVID-
59     19 (7). On March 27, 2020, the USCA announced that additional participants had tested positive
60     for COVID-19 (8). However, no formal investigation has yet been performed to evaluate the
61     total level of transmission that occurred.
62     In this study, we surveyed the players, coaches, officials, volunteers, and spectators who attended
63     the event to assess total positivity, potential days of transmission, and the burden of symptoms
64     experienced among the participants. Following an 85% response rate, we found that 55.6% of all
65     participants reported experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, with nearly all
66     experiencing more than one symptom. Although most participants’ symptoms resolved quickly,
67     9.6% of all participants experienced symptoms for at least one month and 12.6% of all
68     participants reported taking at least 30 days before they felt they had returned to normal. In
69     summary, curling tournaments are at risk for developing into COVID-19 spreader events.
70     Modifications to curling facilities and gameplay (such as increased ventilation, reduced
71     occupancy, and requiring masks), as suggested by current USCA and public health guidelines,
72     are likely required to help prevent transmission in comparison to cleaning protocols alone.

75     This study was submitted to and approved by the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB)
76     Institutional Review Board (IRB) as Exempt under protocol number HP-00092884. Study data
77     were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the University
78     of Maryland, Baltimore (9,10). REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-
79     based software platform designed to support data capture for research studies, providing 1) an
80     intuitive interface for validated data capture; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and
81     export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common
82     statistical packages; and 4) procedures for data integration and interoperability with external
83     sources. REDCap software was utilized to build the data collection survey, distribute the survey,
84     securely collect responses, and generate a database. Participants were given the opportunity to
85     submit their responses for a period of two weeks (September 1-13, 2020) before data collection
86     was closed. All data was dissociated from the participant’s unique link such that all responses
87     were anonymous.
88     Participants were eligible for the survey if they met the following criteria: 1) 18 years of age or
89     older but not older than 88 years of age and 2) were a player, coach, official, volunteer, or
90     spectator. The study size was determined to be 187 individuals, which is the total combined
91     number of participants. The following variables were assessed through the survey: a) participant
92     type (player/alternate/coach; official/ice crew/volunteer; spectator); b) days the participant
93     attended the event; c) gender; d) age group (18-34; 35-54; 55-88 years old); e) whether the
94     participant experienced COVID-19 related symptoms; f) which specific symptoms were
95     experienced; g) was the participant hospitalized; h) length of COVID-19 related symptoms; i)
96     length of time until participant was able to resume normal activities; j) whether the participant
97     received a viral test for COVID-19 and its result; k) whether the participant received an antibody
                                                                          5

 98     test for COVID-19 and its result; and l) did a close contact become symptomatic or test positive
 99     for COVID-19 following the individual’s participation in the tournament. Items f-i were only
100     assessed if the participant answered “yes” to item e.
101     Statistical methods were descriptive and were completed in R version 4.0.2. Number and
102     percents were described for categorical variables, and mean +/- standard deviation (SD) were
103     described for continuous variables. Violin plots were generated using the ggplot2 package (11)
104     and bar plots and heatmaps were created in the base package of R version 4.0.2 (12). For
105     participants who entered 300 days to indicate they had not yet returned to normal activities, we
106     reassigned that number to 175 days for continuous and graphical representations, as that is the
107     approximate number of days between the event and when the survey was administered.
108
109     Results
110     159 (85.0%) participants responded to the survey (Table 1). Volunteers/officials who responded
111     to the survey were older (34.7% 55-88 years of age) and more likely to be male (59.7%)
112     compared to players/coaches (24.4% and 50%, respectively).
113     104 (104/187 = 55.6%) of the participants who were known to have attended the event reported
114     experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (Table 1). There was a marked disparity in
115     percentage of players/coaches who reported having symptoms compared to volunteers/officials
116     who reported having symptoms: 68 (68/88 = 77.3%) of players/coaches who attended the event
117     reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms compared to 29 (29/88 = 33.0%) of
118     volunteers/officials. The most frequent symptoms reported by participants who experienced
119     COVID-19 symptoms were fatigue (n=84, 80.8%), muscle/body aches (n=73, 70.2%),
                                                                           6

120     fever/chills (n=65, 62.5%), new loss of taste or smell (n=63, 60.6%), cough (n=60, 57.7%),
121     headache (n=60, 57.7%), shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (n=39, 37.5%), and
122     congestion or runny nose (n=35, 33.7%). Some participants reported other symptoms (n=9,
123     8.7%) in an open-ended, optional question including rash/skin conditions (n=4, 3.8%), heart
124     abnormalities (n=2, 1.9%), loss of appetite (n=2, 1.9%), paranoia (n=1, 1.0%), hoarse voice
125     (n=1, 1.0%), lower back pain (n=1, 1.0%), and COVID fingers/toes (n=1, 1.0%). Most
126     participants who were symptomatic reported multiple symptoms (Figure 1). Amongst
127     participants who reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, 97.1%, 86.5%, 75.0%, 59.6%,
128     and 45.2% experienced greater than or equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 symptoms, respectively.
129     Overall, 4 out of 187 (2.1%) participants known to have attended the event were hospitalized
130     (Table 1). 18 (9.6%), 4 (2.1%), 3 (1.6%), and 3 (1.6%) participants who were known to attend
131     the event experienced symptoms for greater than or equal to 30, 60, 90, and 150 days,
132     respectively (Figure 2A). In addition, 23 (12.3%), 13 (7.0%), 6 (3.2%), and 4 (2.1%) participants
133     who were known to attend the event were able to return to normal activities at or later than 30,
134     60, 90, and 150 days, respectively (Figure 2B). 35 (18.7%) participants reported being concerned
135     that a close contact who did not attend the event became ill after the event (Table 1).
136     Testing was generally not available for all participants in mid-March after the event concluded.
137     Overall, 115 participants (61.5%) were not viral tested by a nasopharyngeal swab, the only type
138     of viral test that was available at the time (Table 1). 50 (26.7%) participants were not viral tested
139     because they did not experience symptoms, 11 (5.9%) were not viral tested because their
140     healthcare provider suspected another illness, and 54 (28.9%) were not tested but were
141     considered a presumptive case by their healthcare provider. 37 (19.8%) of all participants known
142     to have attended the event had positive viral test results while 7 (3.7%) of all participants had
                                                                           7

143     negative viral test results (Table 1). Many more participants were able to be tested for antibodies
144     in the months following the event. 66 (35.3%) of all participants known to attend the event tested
145     positive for COVID-19 antibodies while 7 (3.7%) of all participants tested negative or
146     inconclusive for COVID-19 antibodies (Table 1). Table 2 describes the number of respondents
147     by symptoms, viral test result, and antibody test result. For example, amongst participants who
148     reported having COVID-19 symptoms, 22 were not tested by either testing method, 7 were not
149     viral tested but had negative/inconclusive antibody test results, and 36 were viral positive (Table
150     2). Amongst respondents, 76 (76/159 = 40.6%) participants were positive by viral, antibody, or
151     both tests; 2 (1.1%) participants were negative by both; 14 (7.5%) participants were not viral
152     tested but were negative by an antibody test; and 67 (35.8%) participants were not tested by
153     either method, 45 (67.2%) of whom did not experience any symptoms.
154     Figure 3 depicts heat maps describing the days that symptomatic (Figure 3A) and asymptomatic
155     (Figure 3B) volunteers attended. Each row designates a specific volunteer, where a blue
156     rectangle above a date denotes that the volunteer attended that day. For example, symptomatic
157     volunteer 1 (bottom of Figure 3A) attended the event every day from Sunday, March 8 through
158     Sunday, March 15. Symptomatic volunteers tended to attend later in the week and for more days
159     (Figure 3A), while asymptomatic volunteers tended to attend earlier in the week and for fewer
160     days (Figure 3B). In particular, symptomatic volunteers attended an average of 4.4 days and
161     86.2% attended Thursday or later, while asymptomatic volunteers attended an average of 2.5
162     days and only 32.6% attended Thursday or later. Plots were also created for the players/coaches
163     (data not shown). However, because these individuals all attended nearly every day, no pattern
164     relating to development of symptoms and days attended was evident.

166     Discussion
167     According to the CDC, gatherings are a significant risk for COVID-19 transmission (13). The
168     2020 USA Curling Club Nationals tournament involved a total of 187 known players, coaches,
169     officials, volunteers, and spectators across a nine-day period. During the tournament, not all of
170     these individuals were present at once, with approximately 40 players and officials on the ice at
171     once and approximately 40 players, coaches and volunteers in the warm room during a normal
172     game session. These repeated gatherings over the course of the tournament proved to be
173     sufficient for transmission, as we observed that a large number of participants (n= 104, 55.6%) at
174     the event experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Not surprisingly, there was a large
175     disparity between the percentage of players/coaches (n= 68, 77.3%) who experienced symptoms
176     and volunteers/officials (n=29, 33.0%) who experienced symptoms. It is likely that the length of
177     time at the event played a big factor here as most players/coaches attended every day of
178     practice/competition (8.23 days attended, on average) while volunteers/officials spent less time
179     at the event (3.24 days attended, on average). Indeed, even amongst volunteers, volunteers
180     reporting symptoms tended to attend more frequently and later in the week than volunteers
181     reporting no symptoms (Figure 3).
182     In order to estimate when the virus may have been widely circulating, we assessed symptomatic
183     volunteers whose last day was early in the week (Figure 3A). In particular, we looked at four
184     symptomatic volunteers (26 through 29). Symptomatic volunteer 29 only attended on Sunday,
185     March 8, reported having fever/chills and a headache and was not tested using either method
186     because their healthcare provider suspected another illness. Symptomatic volunteers 27 & 28
187     only attended on Tuesday, March 10. One had cough, shortness breath/difficulty breathing,
188     fatigue, muscle/body aches, and was not tested via either method but was considered a
                                                                           9

189     presumptive case by their healthcare provider. The other volunteer had muscle/body aches,
190     headache, sore throat, and was tested for both with a negative/inconclusive result for both.
191     Symptomatic volunteer 26 attended three days, with their last day on Wednesday, March 11.
192     This individual reported fever/chills, body aches, loss of taste/smell, cough, shortness
193     breath/difficulty breathing, fatigue, headache, sore throat, and was not tested via either method
194     but was considered a presumptive case by their healthcare provider. In comparison, symptomatic
195     volunteers 22 through 25 last attended on Thursday, March 12. All four had multiple symptoms
196     consistent with COVID-19. One tested positive for both viral and antibody tests, while the other
197     three were not viral tested but were considered presumptive cases, two of whom later tested
198     positive for antibodies. It therefore appears that COVID-19 was widely circulating by Thursday,
199     March 12, but may have been circulating less widely earlier than that date.
200     This survey had a high rate of response; 159 out of 187 participants (85%) known to have
201     attended the event responded to the survey. It is noted that there is likely to be selection bias in
202     respondents in that participants who had symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were more likely
203     to respond to the survey than participants who did not have symptoms. However, to address this
204     possibility, we reported percentages of participants with COVID-19 symptoms, hospitalization
205     rates, and test rates using the denominator of known participants (187) instead of the number of
206     participants who responded (159) to be more conservative in our estimates. Our estimates
207     therefore reflect a “best case” scenario in that we assume that non-respondents did not have
208     positive test results or symptoms consistent with COVID-19. It is possible that several of the
209     remaining 28 participants that did not respond to the survey experienced symptoms of COVID-
210     19 and/or tested positive by a viral or antibody test. However, we do not believe that these
211     additional responses would dramatically alter the results we observed.

212     A particular limitation of this study was the lack of testing—particularly viral testing, which is
213     considered to be the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19—available after the conclusion of
214     the event. Due to this limitation, we have mainly focused our descriptions on the burden of
215     symptoms in participants. In addition, many participants (n=35, 18.7%) reported being
216     concerned that one or more close contacts who did not attend the event became symptomatic or
217     tested positive after the event. Although this question was meant to assess potential secondary
218     cases, another limitation of this study is the authors’ lack of resources and expertise to complete
219     contact tracing after the event. Indeed, it would be a large task as many participants flew home
220     after being exposed at the event. Finally, this study did not assess whether symptomatic
221     volunteers were stationed in the ice shed or the warm room in relation to their volunteer
222     assignment. This question could have helped to determine which environment represents a larger
223     transmission risk. However, this likely would have been difficult to assess, as some volunteers
224     often spent time in the ice shed and warm room as a part of their duties. We believe that both
225     environments were potential transmission areas as evidenced by the 77.3% of players and
226     coaches who developed COVID-19 symptoms and spent significant time on the ice and in the
227     warm room.
228     In conclusion, we observed that curling tournaments can pose a significant risk for transmission
229     of COVID-19, especially to players and volunteers who have repeated exposure to infected
230     individuals. Importantly, the spread of infection was observed even with stringent cleaning
231     protocols and modifications to gameplay and tournament traditions in place. The USCA has
232     since released guidelines detailing modifications to facility operations (such as closing locker
233     rooms), gameplay (using a single sweeper), limiting or removing post-game socializing, and
                                                                          11

235     these guidelines are sufficient to prevent spread of COVID-19 within a curling facility.
