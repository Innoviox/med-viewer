    Abstract:
    Background: A growing burden of mental health problems has become a global concern amid the
    coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Sleep disorders are major mental health problems
    associated with increased psychosocial stressors; however, no research synthesis is available on
    the epidemiology of it. In this systematic scoping review, we aimed to assess the current evidence
    on the epidemiological burden, associated factors, and interventions from the existing literature.
    Method: Seven major health databases and additional sources were searched to identify, evaluate,
    and synthesize empirical studies on the prevalence and correlates of sleep disorders and available
    interventions. The Joanna Briggs Institute Methodology for Scoping Review were used, and the
    findings were reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
    Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist.
    Results: A total of 78 articles were retrieved, the prevalence of sleeping disorders ranged from
    2.3% to 76.6%. Age, sex, level of education, physical and mental health, COVID-19 related
    factors, occupation especially being health care workers (HCW) were the main associated factors.
    Only two intentions were identified to address the issue.
    Conclusion: The finding of this review indicated a high burden of sleep disorder with limited
    interventions that necessitate informing policymakers and practitioners to facilitate future research
    and implementations.

    Brief summary:
    Current Knowledge/Study Rationale: Despite the paramount importance of sleep for the
    physical and mental wellbeing of individuals, sleep hygiene is often neglected which resulted in a
    high prevalence of sleep disorders across the globe. This condition is likely to worsen amid this
    pandemic. This is the first systematic scoping review of sleep disorders during the COVID-19
    pandemic. Study Impact: The findings of our study suggest a high prevalence of sleep disorder
    and highlight a wide range of socio-demographic factors to identify population groups vulnerable
    to the adverse outcomes of sleep disorder with limited interventions. These pieces of evidence will
    guide clinicians to make informed choices for better management of patients and aid public health
    professionals to prevent sleep disorder epidemic concurring with the current pandemic.

         1. Introduction:
    Novel coronavirus disease or COVID-19, an acute respiratory illness caused by a newly discovered
                                                                         1,2
    SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019                                . Since then, it has rapidly surged to Europe,
    especially Italy and Spain, the USA, and progressed to become a global pandemic. In the last
    couple of months, it's reported to be spreading to the countries in other parts of Asia, Africa, and
    Latin America. Globally, by September 27th, 2020, a total of 32,730,945 cases of COVID-19 has
    been reported, including 991,224 deaths 3. Of note, the World Health Organization declared it a
    global pandemic on March 11th, and after the declaration, most of the countries worldwide entered
    nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the infection 4. While the clinical care practitioners
    and public health experts were focused on containing the spread of the virus, the COVID-19
    pandemic and related quarantine measures have taken a heavy toll on people's mental health4,5.
    Historically quarantine has been related to anxiety, depression, panic, irritability, somatic disorder,
    and insomnia6–8. Moreover, a high level of stress and trauma-related disorders are byproducts of
    being isolated5,9,10. Moreover, factors like an extended period of isolation, fear of infection,
    uncertainty, disappointment, fatigue, stigma, inadequate data and information regarding the
    disease, insufficient supplies, and economic damage also negatively impact individuals'
    psychological wellbeing11. Psychosocial stressors like anxiety, stress, altered lifestyle with little to
    no social support, and fear may affect the pattern of sleep among individual often leading to
    sleep disorders 12,13.
    Sleep is an essential physiological activity in keeping up with physical and mental wellbeing and
    better life quality14,15. Breach in the normal sleep cycle can lead to insufficient sleep and prolonged
    alertness, hence increasing the event of insomnia, nightmares, daytime instability, and fatigue14.
    Recent studies have shown that sleep disorders impact up to 1 in 4 adults16. They are also found to
    be associated with a wide range of adverse health outcomes, for example, increased risk of obesity,
    diabetes, hypertension, cerebrovascular diseases, malignancy, musculoskeletal diseases,
    septicemia, and metabolic syndrome14,15,17. Further evaluations have found that 50-70 million
    adults in the United States have at least one sleep disorder16, while the prevalence of sleep disorders
    among the Australians and Netherlanders are 20-35% 18and 27.3% 17respectively. Potential risk
    factors of sleep disorders include severe stressful circumstances, depression, anxiety, trauma, low
    socioeconomic condition, urban living, increased use of technology, and social media14,16,17.
                                                                                                                                       4

    A substantial amount of evidence suggests a high prevalence of various forms of sleep disorders
    in the global community. This situation is likely to worsen in the current circumstances with
    numerous psychological stressors. Many studies have reported a growing burden of a wide range
    of mental disorders, including sleep disorders19. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a
    scarcity of concrete evidence on the magnitude of sleep disorders among individuals affected by
    this pandemic. As there is a growing concern on mental health problems during COVID-19
    research synthesis may play a critical role in understanding the burden of those problems
    addressing the same6,19. This scoping review aims to address this knowledge gap through
    systematically evaluating the current evidence on the epidemiological burden of sleep disorders,
    associated factors, and interventions addressing the problems. The specific questions for this
    scoping review are listed below:
         •    What is the epidemiological burden of sleep disorders among different populations during
              COVID-19?
         •    What are the factors associated with sleep disorders during COVID-19?
         •    What are the available interventions for addressing sleep disorders amid COVID-19?
         2. Methods and materials
    This scoping review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for
    scoping reviews20. Moreover, the findings of this review are reported using the Preferred Reporting
    Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR)
    checklist21. The protocol of this scoping review has been registered with The Open Science
    Framework22.

    The keywords were searched within the titles, abstracts, and subject headings fields. Moreover, as
    COVID-19 literature started to get published since late 2019, we limited our search within 2019
    and 2020. Moreover, we searched the reference lists and citing articles in Google Scholar to
    identify additional articles that could have met our criteria.
    2.2 Inclusion criteria
    2.2.1 Participants
    In this scoping review, we included participants irrespective of their sociodemographic conditions.
    This makes our review inclusive for all types of participants who fulfill remaining criteria of this
    review.

    This review focused on sleep disorders, which can be defined by the International Classification
                                                                                                         23,24
    of Diseases or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders                                       . Moreover, sleep
    abnormalities expressed as insomnia, excessive sleepiness, poor sleep quality, and abnormal
    events that occur during sleep will also be considered as sleep disorders in this review 25. Studies
    reporting the prevalence, incidence, frequency, score, level or any forms of quantitative assessment
    of sleep-related conditions were included in this review.
    2.2.3 Context
    This review especially emphasized on COVID-19 as the context. Therefore, studies conducted
    among populations affected by COVID-19 (doctors or patients) or population at risk (general
    population who could have had infected with COVID-19) were be considered in this review.
    Moreover, studies without mentioning relevance to COVID-19 were excluded from this review.
    2.2.3 Types of sources
    This review included original studies, cross-sectional or longitudinal in nature, published as peer-
    reviewed journal articles. Studies published in English language were included in this review.
    Therefore, unpublished works, non-original articles (for example, letters with no original research
    reports, editorials, reviews, commentaries etc.), non-peer reviewed articles, and studies in
    languages other than English were excluded from this review.
    2.2.4 Study selection
    After searching the databases, all the citations were imported to Rayyan QCRI, a cloud-based
    software for systematic reviews26. Two authors (ST and MR) independently evaluated those
    citations using the inclusion criteria of this review as stated earlier. At the end of independent
    screening, potential conflicts were reviewed and resolved based on discussion with a third author
    (MMH). Finally, the full texts of the included citations were assessed and articles meeting all the
    criteria were considered for data extraction. A flow chart of the study selection process is depicted
    in Figure 1.

    2.3 Data extraction
    A data extraction form was prepared as shown in Table 2. Two authors (ST and MR) independently
    extracted data using this checklist. At the end of this phase, data for each article were reviewed by
    a third author to check consistency and potential conflicts were re-assessed by three reviewers and
    a consensus was made based on discussions. The finalized dataset was reviewed independently by
    two more co-authors (PP and AS) before final synthesis.
    2.4 Data presentation
    Data extracted from the included articles were narratively synthesized and presented using tables
    and a commentary on key findings on the study characteristics, samples, and epidemiological
    findings as the quantitative burden and associated factors of sleep disorders during COVID-19 and
    interventions addressing the same. As per the JBI methodology, scoping reviews do not aim to
    evaluate the quality of the studies. Therefore, no quality evaluation was done in this review.

         3. Result:
    We found 291 citations from searching the databases and 87 citations from additional sources,
    totaling 387 citations. After removing 177 duplicates, titles and abstracts of 210 articles were
    evaluated and 94 articles met the pre-set inclusion criteria. From the remaining articles 16 articles
    were removed after evaluating the full text. Finally, 78 articles met all criteria and were included
    in this scoping review.
    3.1 Characteristics of the included studies:
    3.1.1 Study design:
              Most of the studies 82% (n = 64) were of cross-sectional design. For example, Zhang et
    al., 2020 conducted cross-sectional survey among the hospital workers in China. A few included
    studies (n = 6) were of cohort studies. For example, the study by Nalleballe et al., 202027 reported
    the findings from their cohort of patients of COVID-19. Remaining were case-control (n = 4) and
    pre-post study (n = 3) design.
    3.1.2 Setting:
              Almost half of the studies (n = 36, 46%) were based on community setting. For example,
    the study by Gao et al.,28 recruited 699 American adult participants to find out the effects of the
    pandemic related lockdown on their mental health. However, other half of the studies (n = 37,
    47%) recruited participants from hospitals or clinics. The study by Amerio et al.,29 included
    general practitioners working in Genoa, Italy evaluate the mental health effects of the Covid-19
    pandemic on the healthcare workers.
    3.1.3 Geographical scope:
              One third of the studies, (n = 25, 32%) were conducted in urban areas. For example, 76.5%
    of the participants recruited in the study by Voitsidis et al.,30 were urban citizens. Similarly, the
    study by Xiao, Zhang, Kong, Li, & Yang et al.,31 reported 89.4% participants were recruited from
    urban area. In 13.75% (n = 11) of the studies participants lived equally in urban and rural areas.
    For example, Renzo et al., 32 reported that the percentage of participants living in rural and urban
    areas were comparable. However, in a few studies (n = 18, 23%) participants also came from
    small towns or rural areas.
                                                                                                                                     11

    3.1.4 Country:
              47.5% (n = 38) of the studies were conducted in China. The study by Fu et al.,33 was based
    on Chinese population where they recruited participants from Wuhan, China. 8.75% (n = 7) of the
    studies were based on USA. Wright et al.,34 was an observational study based on the university
    students of the USA. 8.75% (n = 7) of the studies were based on Italy. For example, the study by
    Gualano et al.,35 was based on Italy.
    3.1.5 Sample:
              A large variation was noted in the sample size of the included studies. The sample size
    ranged from 26 to 40,469. Studies that provided intervention or conducted in-person assessments
    had a significantly smaller sample size. For example, Liu et al., 36 conducted a randomized control
    trial of progressive muscle relaxation for insomnia among the COVID-19 patients in a hospital
    setting and had a small sample size of 51 participants. Similarly, Korkmaz et al.,37 conducted face
    to face evaluation of several mental health conditions of health care workers employed in service
    for COVID-19 and had a sample size of 140 participant only.
              However, studies that utilized the online surveys to collect data had a relatively larger
    sample size. For example, S. J. Zhou et al.,38 collected data from 11,835 participants in China via
    online survey forms.
    3.1.6 Sampling technique:
              65% of the studies (n = 51) mentioned specific sampling techniques. Among them, 35% of
    the studies (n = 27) used the convenient sampling technique to recruit the participants. For
    example, Diomidous,et al.,39 used convenient sampling technique to include health care providers
    for their study. Some studies (n = 6) also used the random sampling technique. For example, Liu
    et al.,36 randomly selected 51 patients from the list of patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted
    to the Hainan General Hospital for participating in their study. A few studies used clustered
    sampling technique. For example, Abdulah and colleagues’                                  40
                                                                                                   used the clustered sampling
    technique. They obtained a list of local physicians who work in different medical settings. The
    participants from one pediatric, one emergency, one special corona, and one maternity and
    gynecology hospital were invited to participate in their online survey.
                                                                                                                                     12

    3.1.7 Disorders investigated:
              All the studies assessed insomnia/sleep disorder or quality of sleep. Most of the studies (n
    = 38, 49%) also investigated the level of anxiety among participants. For example, Mazza et al.,41
    assessed prevalence of anxiety among the COVID-19 survivors in Italy. Depression/depressive
    symptoms were assessed by 88 studies. For example, Huang et al.,42 measured the burden of
    depression among Chinese public during the outbreak. Loneliness, suicidal ideation, somatic
    disorders, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) were among other less frequently assessed
    disorders.
    3.1.8 Mode of data collection:
              85% of the studies (n = 66) collected data through online surveys. For example, W.D.S. et
    al.,43 collected data using online surveys on different social media platforms. Similarly, J et al.,44
    collected data from the Chinese population using the WeChat (the most widely used mobile app).
    Only 7% of the studies utilized more than one means of data collection. For example, Renzo et
    al.,32 collected data using face to face interview, online survey and from reviewing hospital records
    of the patients. Remaining studies (n = 6, 7%) collected data solely from face to face interviews.
    For example, Türkoğlu et al.,45 collected data from in person evaluation of the children who
    participated in the study.
    3.1.9 Screening instruments and cut off value:
              Majority of the studies (n = 50, 64%) employed the PSQI for diagnosing the severity of the
    insomnia. For example, Huang & Zhao et al.,42 used the Chinese version of PSQI whereas, the
    study by Innocenti et al.,46 used the Italian version of PSQI among their participant. A little over
    half of the studies (n = 42, 53%) used the ISI scale for diagnosing insomnia. Gualano et al.,35 used
    ISI scale to diagnose insomnia among the Italian population. Few studies (n = 15,19%) also utilized
    the AIS scale for diagnosis. For example, Tselebis et al.,47 used AIS for diagnosing insomnia
    among COVID-19 survivors.
              Majority of the studies used score of ≤ 7 for PSQI, ≤ 10 for ISI, and ≤ 6 for AIS scale as
    cut of value for diagnosing the severity of insomnia.
                                                                                                                                     13

    3.2 Characteristics of study population:
    3.2.1 Education:
              Most studies did not report stratified levels of education among the participants or recruited
    people with mixed education status. In 16.25% (n = 13) of studies, the participants had at least
    bachelor’s degree. For example, according to Li et al.,48 88.37% of the participants had bachelor’s
    degree. Only 20% (n = 16) of the studies included participants with graduate degree or above.
    According to Bhargava et al.,49 all the participants included in the study were specialized doctors
    who had graduate degrees or above. Furthermore, 26.25% (n = 21) studies recruited participants
    with various level of education. For example, Dai et al.,50 reported that, 60.69% of the recruited
    participants had undergraduate degree, 31.99% had graduate degree and 7.32% had high school
    degree.
    3.2.2 Population Specifics:
              Nearly one third (n = 22, 27.5%) studies were based on healthcare workers. For example,
    the study by Korkmaz et al.,37 was conducted among nurses, physician and other health care staff
    in the hospital. One fourth of the studies (n = 20) focused on general population. For example,
    Innocenti et al.,46 invited general populations of Italy to participate in their study. Alongside,
    8.75% (n = 7) of the studies included only COVID-19 patients. Diomidous et al.,39 included
    participants (n = 204) from Greece who were confirmed cases of COVID-19. A few studies, (n =
    6, 7.5%) included only quarantined people. For example, Salehinejad et al.,51 included participants
    who were quarantined at home during COVID-19.
    3.2.3 Age:
              Mean age ranged from 7.89 years to 63.9 years. Türkoğlu et al.,45 included 46 children with
    autism spectrum disorder and the mean age of the participants in this study was 7.89 years. Pinto
    et al.,52 a study based on Portugal population, included 365 participants in their study and the mean
    age of the participants was 63.9 years.
    3.2.4 Gender (% of males):
              The total percentage of male participants in the study varied widely. It ranged from 3% to
    82%, with a median value of 37.5%. Nevertheless, in majority of the studies the percentage of

    male participants were between 40%-60%. For example, Gupta et al.,53 reported of 58% male
    participants whereas, Li et al.,54 reported of 43% male participants.
    3.3 Prevalence of sleep disorder:
              The prevalence of sleep disorders varied across the samples. Ranging from 2.3% to 76.6%
    For example, Zhang et al.,55 reported the overall prevalence of insomnia was as high as 76.6%
    among the medically isolated population. The prevalence rates varied across geographic regions
    of corresponding primary studies. For example, the prevalence of insomnia in the United States
    ranged between 20-41%. For example, 30% participants reported of some degree of insomnia in
    the study by Bhargava et al.,49 in the USA. Whereas, a significant variation was noted in the
    prevalence of insomnia in Chinese population. Although only 2.3% of the Chinese workforce
    reported of insomnia56, 58% of the frontline medical staff were suffering from insomnia44. Such
    variation was also noted in Italy, where the prevalence of insomnia ranged from 37.6% to 57%.
    For example, according to Casagrande et al.,57 57.1% participants in Italy had insomnia and poor
    sleep quality.
    3.4 Factors associated with sleep disorders during COVID-19:
    3.4.1 Sex:
              20% of the studies (n =15) reported that females had a higher risk of some degree of
    insomnia. For example, Batool-Anwar et al.,58 reported that stratification by gender revealed
    worsening insomnia only among women. However, two studies also reported that males had higher
    risk of insomnia. For example, male participants in the study by Anzar et al.,59 reported higher
    prevalence of insomnia and poor sleep quality.
    3.4.2 Age:
              Only 7 studies reported that younger population had worse sleep compared to their older
    counterpart. For example. Beck et al.,60 mentioned that, younger population reported higher sleep
    disturbance compared to older population (79% vs 72%). Nevertheless, 4 studies reported of poor
    sleep among the older population as well. For example, Wang et al.,61 reported that older
    population had 1.42 times higher risk of insomnia.
    3.4.3 Education:
                                                                                                                                     29

              Several studies found that level of education was associated with worse sleep. Zhang et
    al.,62 reported that education level of high school or below increased the risk of insomnia but                                   33
    reported that participants having higher educational level had worse sleep.
    3.4.4 Social support:
              Social support was an important factor associated with sleep. Four studies reported that
    those with lack of social support had higher prevalence of insomnia and poor quality of sleep. For
    example, Tselebi et al.,47 reported participants with lack of family support had higher level of
    insomnia. Individuals in isolation52, living alone63 suffering from loneliness64 or being single                                  44
    also reported of high degree of insomnia. This further emphasizes the impact of social support on
    sleep.
    3.4.5 Physical health:
               Individuals with preexisting chronic disease (n = 4) and perceived poor health (n = 5)
    suffered from higher prevalence of insomnia.
    3.4.6 Mental health:
              Insomnia worsened among patients with preexisting psychiatric illness (n = 4). Stress (n =
    6), anxiety(n = 8), depression (n = 4), fatigue Zhang et al., 62 and low mood Carrigan et al.,65 was
    also found to be associated with poor sleep.
    3.4.7 Lack of Physical activity:
              Three studies reported that reduced opportunities of physical activities were associated
    with poor sleep among participants.
    3.4.8 Being Health Care Worker:
              Nearly 13% (n =10) of the studies reported that, health care workers were at risk of some
    degree of insomnia. For example, Anzar et al.,59 reported that HCW had not only a higher
    prevalence of insomnia but also had reduced quality of sleep.
              Four studies reported that the health care workers at risk of contracting COVID-19 had
    poor sleep quality. For example, Carrigan et al.,65 found that, being at risk of CVID-19 at work
    lowers the quality of sleep. Zhang et al.,62also found that working in the isolation unit impaired
                                                                                                                                     30

    the sleep cycle among HCWs. Frontline medical workers suffered from higher level of insomnia
    compared to non-frontline workers. For example, Qi et al.,66 reported that Frontline worker in the
    Wuhan, China (epicenter of the outbreak in China) scored significantly higher in the PSQI scale
    compared to non-front liners in Ningbo. Shift work 28, reluctance to join the frontline 67 and higher
    burden of work 68 also played an important role in sleeping.
    3.4.9 Factors Specific to COVID-19:
              Two studies reported that patients suffering from COVID-19 reported poor quality of sleep.
    Fear of COVID-19 (n = 2) and worry about the disease (n = 5) also affected the quality of sleep.
    Uncertainty due to the pandemic (n = 5), negative attitude toward control measures such as wearing
    mask 69 and lack of availability of testing 50 were the other factors specific to COVID-19 associated
    with sleep.
    3.4.10 Factors related to work:
              Several factors related to employment also impacted sleep significantly. One study found
    that people with low income had higher risk of sleep disorder compared to their high-income
    counterparts33. Worrying about impact of this pandemic on livelihood, possible negative impact
    on their income was also associated with sleep disorders63. One study mentioned that being at
    home without any work also impaired regular sleep cycle52. On the contrary, stress for returning
    to work after the lockdown did not impair sleep56.
    3.5 Interventions for sleep disorders:
               There were only two interventions for sleep disorders. The study by Chen et al.,70 was
    conducted among COVID-2019 patients, where the intervention group performed Baduanjin
    exercise (traditional Chinese mind-body exercise routine) under professional guidance and the
    controls received usual care. Their anxiety and insomnia level was measured using GAD-7 and
    SMH Sleep questionnaire at baseline and discharge. Although there was no significant difference
    among these groups at baseline, intervention group showed 44% lower score (P<0.001) in GAD
    and 76% lower score (P=0.003) in the SMH Sleep questionnaire at discharge which indicated that
    Baduanjin exercise can be beneficial for improving anxiety and insomnia among COVID-19
    patients.
                                                                                                                                     31

              In the randomized controlled clinical trial by Liu et al.,36 patients with COVID-19 patients
    who entered the isolation ward were randomly divided into experimental and control groups where
    the experimental group used progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) technology for 30 min per day
    for 5 consecutive days and the control group received only routine care and treatment. The
    Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI) and Sleep State Self-Rating Scale (SRSS) were used
    to measure and record patient anxiety and sleep quality pre and post intervention. Both the group
    had comparable scores before intervention however, STAI and SRSS scores reduces significantly
    after intervention (P <0.001).
         4. Discussion:
    4.1 Overview of the synthesized findings
    After a thorough review of the available evidence, there were 78 studies that met the pre-set criteria
    of this scoping review. Most of the studies included were cross-sectional in design, and online
    questionnaires were the common mode of data collection. Studies were conducted both in the
    community and hospital settings. Most of the studies on sleep disorders were conducted in China
    or the USA. Insomnia, anxiety, and depression were commonly assessed disorders, and PSQI,
    ISIS, and AIS were used to evaluate insomnia and sleep quality. The findings from these existing
    literatures inform a high burden of sleep disorder during this pandemic. The prevalence of sleep
    disorder varied widely across the samples and ranged from 2.3% - 76.6%. The majority of the
    studies reported females had a higher risk of some degree of insomnia. Although older adults
    generally have a higher rate of insomnia, many studies have reported that younger generations
    were having difficulties with sleeping during the pandemic. Covariates-adjusted research was
    limited which could explain how age played a role in sleep patterns among the study samples.
    Moreover, the education level was also associated with sleep disorders, but there was ambiguity
    regarding the specific educational status. Both higher education and high school level education
    were found to impact sleep. This can be attributable to the fact the educated individuals or students
    may have academic and professional stressors that may have impacted their mental health and
    sleep conditions71–73. Furthermore, social support was found to have a critical role in sleep status
    and associated disorders. Lack of social support, family support, living alone, and isolation was
    associated with a higher risk of sleep disorders.
                                                                                                                                     32

              This review also found that comorbid physical and mental illness increased the risks of
    insomnia. Health care workers, especially those serving the frontline, were at high risk of insomnia
    during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased workload, shift work, fear of contracting the virus were
    the significant risk factors among the HCW. This might have resulted in higher psychosocial stress
    and burnout, which can be associated with sleep disorders among the frontlines74. The fear of
    contracting the virus, worry about the disease, uncertainty regarding treatment and prevention
    measures, and negative attitude toward control measures were COVID-19 specific risk factors for
    sleep disorders. Other related factors were lack of opportunity for physical activity, fear of the
    negative impact on income, and staying at home without employment. Only two interventions
    were identified, which focused either on baduanjin exercise (as one of the traditional Chinese
    mind-body exercise) or progressive muscular reaction. Both reported significant improvement on
    sleep score after the intervention 75,76
              The findings of this current review are comparable with the previous literature. Our review
    reports a considerably higher prevalence of both insomnia and insomnia symptoms higher during
    this pandemic. Several reviews have also reported higher prevalence after stressful events like
    stroke, chronic injuries77. The current review reports that females were at higher risk on insomnia
    and many studies have found that female are at high risk several mental illnesses such as anxiety
    and depression78.
              Despite the lack of accurate normative data on evolution of sleep architecture with age,
    several studies suggest that sleep patterns of the individuals change across the lifespan. In older
    adults have a significant delay in sleep latency and decrease in total REM sleep79. These findings
    suggest that older adults have more problems with sleep compared to the younger population.
    However, several studies included in this review reported that younger population had more
    trouble with sleep. This could be explained by the preexisting and emerging academic and
    processional uncertainty and the mental stressors amid this pandemic.
              Our findings are also in line with evidence suggesting that individuals with insomnia have
    a higher risk of psychiatric disorders and sleep disturbances may facilitate the onset of several
    mental health illness. Many studies have reported that there is a bidirectional relationship between
    anxiety, depression and insomnia80. In this circumstance high rate of insomnia among individuals
    with preexisting psychological was unsurprising.
                                                                                                                                     33

              Our review shed light on the high prevalence of insomnia and sleep disturbances among
    health care workers especially those in frontline. Studies from previous major outbreaks of SARS,
    MERS have also reported of elevation of psychological distress among HCW during and after the
    outbreak which interfered with their social and occupational functioning81–83. We need to learn
    from the history and intervene at the early stage to support these HCWs.
    Limitations of the review
              This scoping review has several limitations. The foremost limitation of the current
    literature is that most studies are cross-sectional or longitudinal design, most of which did not
    collect data before the onset of the pandemic to provide a comparative picture of the situation. The
    limited number of studies reporting prevalence at multiple time points made it difficult to
    determine how the insomnia status of individuals changed over time.
               To investigate temporality and establish causal relationships, risk factors should be
    captured before the inception of the disease. Owing to this, causal relationship was not established.
    Therefore, the conclusion of this scoping review is limited to demonstrating association only.
              Additionally, there is a risk of potential selection bias as we did not search all the databases
    and excluded unpublished studies, reports, and studies in languages other than English. Moreover,
    there could be a publication bias within the scientific literature as less significant findings are less
    likely to get published, thus may not contribute to the evidence base. Furthermore, we did not
    conduct a quantitative evaluation of the patient-level data, which could have eliminated within-
    study and between-study variations to provide uniform prevalence estimations across samples.
              Another notable limitation of this review was limiting the search strategy within
    bibliometric databases, whereas a major proportion of the literature can be available on preprint
    servers. As we aimed to synthesize the peer-reviewed empirical research, we did not search the
    preprint sources that might have had early stage findings rather than peer-reviewed articles. Lastly,
    as most studies were conducted in China and the USA, our findings' generalizability may be
    limited because of the wide variation of cultural norms and the healthcare system across the globe.
    Sleep disorders and co-morbid mental health problems may be highly prevalent in people living
    in low-income countries that are underrepresented in the existing studies84,85. Also, people with
    preexisting neuropsychiatric conditions or psychosocial vulnerabilities may experience a
                                                                                                                                     34

    disproportionate burden of sleep disorders, that is yet to be examined through empirical research.
    Our review may not have captured the epidemiology of sleep disorders in those marginalized
    populations.
    4.2 Implications for future research
              The evidence landscape on COVID-19 and associated mental health problems has been
    changing rapidly86,87. This scoping review examined the epidemiological aspects of sleep
    disorders. As this review includes literature up to August 12, 2020, the synthesized evidence can
    be different from those studies published after that date, or those research that are being conducted
    now. However, as the goal of a scoping review is to chart the initial evidence in a scientific topic,
    the findings if this review can serve as the basis of future research focusing on specific subtopics
    of sleep disorders amid this pandemic. Such areas can be examined using specific methods
    appropriate for respective research objectives.
              As most studies in this review were cross-sectional in nature, future studies should adopt
    longitudinal designs that may explore how the magnitude and correlators of sleep disorders evolve
    over time. Moreover, it is essential to examine the comorbid physical and mental health problems
    that are associated with sleep disorders (Hossain et al., 2020). Understanding the syndemic effects
    of multiple health problems may better inform why the prevalence and risk factors of sleep
    disorders may vary across samples88,89. Furthermore, it is essential to examine the mental health
    problems associated with sleep disorders in high risk populations such as those with
    neurodevelopmental disorders or social-economically marginalized populations. Evaluating the
    Epidemiology of sleep disorders in diverse population groups through cohort studies may provide
    valuable insights not only during this pandemic but also how different populations may experience
    unique psychosocial challenges during public health emergencies.
              One of the notable findings of this review was the use of multiple scales for assessing sleep
    disorders as well as associated mental health problems. Many scholars have adopted previous
    scales, where is several new scales were introduced during this pandemic90. It is essential to
    conduct extensive factor analysis evaluating the appropriateness of multiple skills so that future
    research can be conducted using standardized scales and measurements. such efforts may provide
    a more accurate scenario of the epidemiology of sleep disorders.
                                                                                                                                     35

              The emergence of online data collection measures may provide easy access to people who
    may use those platforms; however, people with digital divide may not participate in such
    studies91,92. it is essential to consider such limitations of the existing research efforts and design
    inclusive methodology's that may include diverse populations. In future research, measurements
    on psychosocial health outcomes including sleep disorders can be included in primary care and
    hospital health records that may offer valuable information on sleep disorders and other mental
    health problems. Nonetheless, Population based research exploring health and social aspects of
    COVID-19 may include instruments measuring the impacts of this pandemic on sleep behavior in
    different populations. Such approaches may improve the research production and the quality of
    data on Epidemiology of sleep disorders during this pandemic.
    4.3 Implications for mental health policymaking and practice
              This review examined the Epidemiology of sleep disorders, which may provide meaningful
    insights for mental health policy making and practice. The ongoing interventions and preventive
    measures adopted in different contexts should revisit the components that may influence sleep
    outcomes across populations. Institutional and local policies and programs on mental health should
    not only target mental disorders such as anxiety and depression, but also emphasize on sleep
    disorders that are highly prevalent in COVID-19 affected populations. Specific provisions should
    be made to prevent, diagnose, and treat sleep disorders. The emergence of telemedicine and online
    support systems provide unique opportunities from a public mental health perspective93. such
    services should be developed and implemented considering the burden and risk factors of sleep
    disorders during this pandemic. psychiatrists and psychologists may access over arcing risk and
    protective factors of sleep disorders and other mental health problems that can be managed using
    cost effective and evidence-based approaches. It is necessary to adopt such guidelines and services
    in psychosocial care policies and programs in different contexts. such measures can be customized
    using local mental health data considering the available mental health resources in those contexts.
    Furthermore, pandemic preparedness and mental health action plans should be informed by the
    epidemiological evidence on sleep disorders that may potentially impact the health and well being
    of health care providers, hospitalized patients, informal caregivers, and population at risk during
    COVID-19 pandemic.

              Evidence-based pharmacological and psychosocial interventions have paramount
    importance for addressing sleep disorders. However, despite the elaborate searching through the
    databases, only two interventions were identified that focused on improving insomnia during the
    pandemic. Both of these interventions took place inside hospitals among patients admitted with
    COVID-19. Whereas, our review indicates a high prevalence of insomnia among patients, HCW
    as well as the general population. This necessitates community-based interventions to improve
    sleep among the target population. Mental health practitioners may access the relevance and
    appropriateness of existing interventions that may help during this pandemic. It is essential to
    conduct implementation research examining the effectiveness and efficiency of available
    interventions and develop newer interventions that may target specific psychosocial stressors for
    sleep disorders during this pandemic.
              The findings of this review, emphasizes the need for early detection and eﬀective treatment
    all the symptoms of insomnia, including the mild ones, before they evolve to more complex and
    evokes enduring psychological responses. Current knowledge of prevalence, type and
    comorbidities of prevalence, symptom profiles and comorbidities of insomnia should be utilized
    and tailored interventions targeting the behavioral components should be further developed to
    address the issue.
              It has been evident that there is widespread of insomnia among the general population in
    this pandemic. All patients coming in contact with health care facilities should be screened, and
    those diagnosed with any form of insomnia should be referred to appropriate resources. As
    healthcare workers reported a higher burden of insomnia, specific interventions designed for
    addressing the problems at health care facilities should be available. The majority of health care
    workers are overburdened. If their optimal health and wellness are not ensured, their ability to
    work will be further compromised impose a severe predicament on the current fragile healthcare
    system.
              Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the treatment of choice for insomnia.
    A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs reported that, CBI-I is the effective mode of
    treatment for insomnia capable of producing clinically meaningful effect size with no identifiable
    adverse effects94. Several studies have also shown small to large effects on efficiency and quality
    and sleep onset latency along with reduction in severity of insomnia, wake after sleep onset and
                                                                                                                                     37

    number of awakenings95. Moreover, a full economic evaluation of CBT-I in adult populations
    revealed CBT-I was cost-effective compared to pharmacotherapy or no treatment. Thus,
    incorporation of some form of CBT-I in clinical practice will improve the overall sleep status of
    the population.
              If the delivery of in-person CBT-I is not possible due to the social distancing measures for
    preventing the spread of the virus, similar interventions can be delivered using the virtual
    platforms. CBT-I delivered though internet or computer was also found to be as effective and a
                                                              96–98
    viable alternative in the current context                       . Alongside, other avenues of telepsychiatry such as
    virtual clinics, remotely delivered psychotherapies, psychoeducation, 24/7 chat lines and digital
    monitoring should also be explored.
              For areas with poor internet connection or individuals who are not accustomed with modern
    intervention formats, self‐help books may be an effective alternative which could possibly reduce
    ensure standardization of care, quality control and optimal resource utilization99.
              Accumulating evidence show that exercise and dietary interventions are associated with
    improved quality of sleep. A large RCT conducted in China reported that low fat diet and increased
    amount of exercise resulted in improved sleep by altering the metabolic pathways. Future
    intervention research should focus on how lifestyle-based interventions can impact sleep quality
    and overall mental health in different populations at risk. It is critical to assess the risk and
    protective factors that can be used to develop mental health promotion programs that potentially
    prevent sleep disorders among the vulnerable individuals. The scope of digital interventions , peer
    support groups community-based mental health services, self-management programs, And public
    mental health resources should be evaluated for promoting mental health and preventing sleep
    disorders across populations.
         5. Conclusions:
              Amid this global pandemic burden of mental health issues are becoming a growing concern
    in addition to infection control. Sleep disorders are significant mental health problems associated
    with increased psychosocial stressors. Findings from this review suggest a high burden of sleep
    disorder across different population groups. Female gender, younger population, HCWs, COVID-
    19 related stressors were the major factors associated with sleep disorder identified in this review.
                                                                                                                                     38

    Despite the high burden, a limited number of interventions were identified to address this problem.
    Early diagnosis of sleep disorder and adequate treatment is crucial to prevent further worsening of
    the condition. Evidence-based pharmacological and psychosocial interventions have paramount
    importance for addressing sleep disorders. Future studies should explore interventions that utilize
    digital platforms and adopt innovative strategies in order to ensure increased outreach and
    sustainability.
