    Abstract
    Understanding the characteristics of the SARS-Cov-2/Covid-19 pandemic is central to
    developing control strategies. Here we show how a simple Susceptible-Infective-Recovered
    (SIR) model applied to data for eight European countries and the United Kingdom (UK) can be
    used to forecast the descending limb (post-peak) of confirmed cases and deaths as a function of
    time, and predict the duration of the pandemic once it has peaked, by estimating and fixing
    parameters using only characteristics of the ascending limb and the magnitude of the first peak.
    As with all epidemiological analyses, unanticipated behavioral changes will result in deviations
    between projection and observation. This is abundantly clear for the current pandemic.
    Nonetheless, accurate short-term projections are possible, and the methodology we present is a
    useful addition to the epidemiologist's armamentarium. Since our predictions assume that control
    measures such as lockdown, social distancing, use of masks etc. remain the same post-peak as
    before peak, deviations from our predictions are a measure of the extent to which loosening of
    control measures have impacted case-loads and deaths since the first peak and initial decline in
    daily cases and deaths. The predicted and actual case fatality ratio, or number of deaths per
    million population from the start of the pandemic to when daily deaths number less than five for
    the first time, was lowest in Norway (pred: 44 ¬± 5 deaths/million; actual: 36 deaths/million) and
    highest for the United Kingdom (pred: 578 +/- 65 deaths/million; actual 621 deaths/million). The
    inferred pandemic characteristics separated into two distinct groups: those that are largely
    invariant across countries, and those that are highly variable. Among the former is the infective
    period, ùëáùêø (ùëáùêø = 16.3 ¬± 2.7 days); the average time between contacts, TR (ùëáùëÖ = 3.8 ¬± 0.5) days

                                                                                                                                                 1

    and the average number of contacts while infective , ùëÖ (ùëÖ = 4.4 ¬± 0.5). In contrast, there is a
    highly variable time lag ùëáùê∑ between the peak in the daily number of confirmed cases and the
    peak in the daily number of deaths, ranging from a low of ùëáùê∑ = 2,4 days for Denmark and Italy
    respectively, to highs of ùëáùê∑ = 12, 15 for Germany and Norway respectively. The mortality
    fraction, or ratio of deaths to confirmed cases, was also highly variable, ranging from low values
    3%, 5% and 5% for Norway, Denmark and Germany respectively, to high values of 18%, 20%
    and 21% for Sweden, France, and the UK respectively. The probability of mortality rather than
    recovery was a significant correlate of the duration of the pandemic, defined as the time from
    12/31/2019 to when the number of daily deaths fell below 5. Finally, we observed a small but
    detectable effect of average temperature on the probability ùõº of infection per contact, with higher
    temperatures associated with lower infectivity. Policy implications of our findings are also
    briefly discussed.

    I. Introduction

    Coronaviruses are large, enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses which are widespread in animals
    and usually cause only mild respiratory illnesses in humans [1-5]. However, in 2003, a new
    coronavirus SARS-CoV emerged, which caused a life-threatening respiratory disease, with a
    fatality rate of almost 10% [6,7]. Unfortunately, after an initial burst of interest in development of
    treatment options, interest in this virus waned. The emergence of a novel coronavirus
    SARS-CoV-2, identified in January 2020 as the likely causative agent of a cluster of pneumonia
    cases which first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has since caused a worldwide
    pandemic [8-13]. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to cause pathology in humans
    [1]. The associated respiratory illness, called COVID-19, ranges in severity from a symptomless
    infection [8], to common-cold like symptoms, to viral pneumonia, organ failure, neurological
    complications and death [9-11]. While the mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infections is lower than in
    SARS-CoV [9-12], it has more favorable transmission characteristics, a higher reproduction
    number [13], and as we will show, a long latency period and asymptomatic infective phase.

    The governments of several countries have taken significant measures to slow the infection rate of
    Covid-19, such as social distancing, quarantine, identification, tracking and isolation. However,
    there is no uniform policy, some governments have reacted later than others and some (e.g.
    Sweden) made a deliberate decision to keep the country open, leaving counter-measures up to
    individuals.

    A large amount of consistent public data is now available on the number of tests performed, the
    number of confirmed infected cases, and the number of deaths in different contexts, such as
    locations and health conditions [14]. These provide important sources of information for the
    development and testing of models that can identify pandemic characteristics affecting viral
    dynamics, and guide public policy by predicting the impact of various interventions [15].

    All data, of course, have limitations, and it‚Äôs ultimately the completeness and quality of data that
    limit the success of models. It is well known that confirmed infected cases seriously
    underestimate the actual number of infections [16,17]: not everyone who is infected is
    symptomatic, and not everyone who dies from the disease has been tested [18]. Even the number
    of reported deaths may be underestimated because of co-mortalities; i.e. COVID-19 increases
    susceptibility to other diseases and conditions [19]. Moreover, the virus can be transmitted by
    asymptomatic individuals ‚Äì who comprise a substantial portion of the infected population [20]
    ‚Äîmilitating against accurate estimates of transmission probability. Nonetheless as indicated in
    [21] and by our own verified forecasts, models can provide useful information.

    Dynamical (mechanistic) models, such as the one presented here, have been used for forecasting
    (meaning that once initial conditions are set, there are no changes in the model) and for
    projecting (the outcome is changed by intervention strategies). For example, projections and
    forecasting models of various types have been used as early as February, 2020 to determine a
    reproductive number [13]. More generally multiple research groups have used them to estimate
    Case Fatality Ratios (CFRs) [22], to forecast and project the need for hospital beds [23] and to
    project and forecast mortality [24]. More specifically, among the many applications to COVID-
    19, four variable Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered models have been used to project the

                                                                                                                                       3

    impact of social distancing on mortality [25], three variable Susceptible-Infective-Recovered
    models to estimate case fatality and recovery ratios early in the pandemic [26], and a time
    delayed SIR has been used to evaluate the effectiveness of suppression strategies [27]. One of the
    most ambitious dynamical models, which includes 8 state variables and 16 parameters was
    fruitfully applied to evaluate intervention strategies in Italy, in spite of the fact that parameter
    identifiability could not be assured [28].

    Our simplified version of the original SIR model [29] differentiates itself from the studies done so
    far by a unique methodological approach to rigorous identification of parameters, and by making
    a number of useful predictions very easily, such as the duration of the pandemic in different
    countries and case fatality ratios, using only characteristics of the increasing portion of verified
    cases vs time, and the amplitude of the peak in the daily cases. Although it is sometimes said that
    using daily mortality data is more reliable than daily verified cases, we find that at least in the
    countries we analyzed, the patterns for these two quantities are virtually identical, differing only
    in amplitude and a rigid time translation.

    It is important to note that extrapolating our model predictions for daily cases and deaths past the
    peak assumes that control measures such as lockdown, social distancing, use of masks etc and care
    given to Covid-19 patients remained the same after the peak in daily cases as before the peak.
    Observed deviations from our predictions are a measure of the extent to which loosening of control
    measures or changes in care of infected individuals impacted case-loads and deaths past the peaks
    in the number of cases and deaths.

    II. Methods:

    We model the Covid-19 pandemic using a simplified version of the SIR model [29], which
    partitions the population into three compartments, Susceptibles (S), Infectious (I) and Removed
    R: Recovered or Dead after being infected. This and other models to study the global spread of
    diseases have been used in a variety of contexts (For some recent reviews, see [30-32]).

    So far, the Covid-19 pandemic, at least in the developed countries in Europe where we will apply
    this model, seems to have the following dynamics: After being infected, an individual remains
    able to infect others for an average of ùëáùêø days. After a time ùëáùêø , the infected individual becomes
    sick, gets tested, is identified as infected and is removed from the pool by quarantine or
    hospitalization. Thus, in our context, the SIR model dynamics can be defined as follows: At t=0,
    there is a pool of ùëÅ interacting individuals, almost all of whom are in the S compartment, except
    for the few infected cases in the I compartment. The R compartment is empty at t=0. Over time,
    individuals move from S to I and from I to R. In R, they either recover or die. Since the Recovered
    pool is populated only from the Infected pool, on average, the number removed each day must
    equal the number infected sometime in the past; i.e. the two are related by a fixed time
    displacement and a ‚Äúmortality probability‚Äù factor. We assume that the number of deaths and the
    number of individuals recovered each day are proportional to the number Removed each day by
    fixed probabilities, that remain invariant over the course of the epidemic; i.e. that the number dead
    or recovered each day are proportional to the number infected on some previous day, with different
    time delays and probabilities.

    The Model:

    Let,

    ùëã1 (ùë°) = number of Susceptible individuals at time t,                                                           (1)
    ùëã2 (ùë°) = number of Infected individuals at time t,                                                              (2)
    ùëã3 (ùë°) = number of individuals that are Removed at time t                                                       (3)
    ùëã1 (ùë°) + ùëã2 (ùë°) + ùëã3 (ùë°) = ùëÅ                                                                                    (4)

    A fraction ùõø of the infected individuals will die after being identified as infected. On average, there
    will be a time delay ùëáùê∑ between when a person is identified to be infected (tests positive) and when
    he/she dies of the disease. ùëáùê∑ will depend on a variety of factors, such as quality of care, age,
    severity of disease, co-morbidities, immune status etc.

    Under these assumptions, the number of deaths ùëã4 (ùë°) at time ùë° is related to the number of Infected
    cases ùëã2 by:

    ùëã4 (ùë°) = ùõø ùëã2 (ùë° ‚àí ùëáùê∑ ) = number of individuals that died on day t                                              (5a)

    Similarly, the number of Recovered at time ùë° will be:

    ùëã5 (ùë°) = ÔÅ¢ ùëã2 (ùë° ‚àí ùëáùëÖùëí ) = number of individuals that recovered on day t                                        (5b)

    Let,

    ÔÅ° be the transmission rate, the probability of infection per day per contact.                                   (6)
                                                                                1
    and let ÔÅß be the rate at which individuals leave the infected population = ùëá ,                                  (7)
                                                                                                          ùêø
    with ùëáùêø being interpreted as the latency, or the average time interval during
    which an infected individual can infect a naive individual.

    The equations governing the dynamics are:

    ùëëùëã1
           = ‚àíùõºùëã1 ùëã2                                                                                                (8)
     ùëëùë°

    ùëëùëã2
           = ùõºùëã1 ùëã2 ‚àí ùõæùëã2                                                                                           (9)
     ùëëùë°

    The initial conditions at ùë° = 0 are:

    ùëã1 (0) = (ùëÅ ‚àí ùëé) ~ ùëÅ and ùëã2 (0) = ùëé; with ùëé ‚â™ ùëÅ                                                                 (10)

    An equation relating the state variables ùëã1 and ùëã2 can be obtained by dividing (8) by (9)
    and integrating. This gives,

                         ùëÅ         ùëã1 (ùë°)
    ùëã2 (ùë°) = ùëÅ +           log (            ) ‚àí ùëã1 (ùë°)                                                              (11)
                         ùëÖ           ùëÅ


                                                                                                                                       5

    where ùëÖÔÇ∫                                                                                                        (12)

     ùëëùë°                         ùëÖ             ùëÅ

                                                                  ùõæ    ùëÅ
    From (9) the maximum in ùëã2 is at ùëã1 =                             =ùëÖ                                            (14)
                                                                  ùõº

    Substituting this into (13) gives:
                                                          ùëÅ
    Maximum value of ùëã2 ‚â° ùëÉ = ùëÅ ‚àí [ 1 + log(ùëÖ)]                                                                     (15)
                                                          ùëÖ

    At ùë° = ‚àû, ùëã2 = 0. Hence, from (13), we get:

               log(ùëÜ1 (‚àû))                               ùëã1 (‚àû)
    ùëÖ=‚àí         [1‚àíùëÜ1(‚àû)]
                           ,   where ùëÜ1 (‚àû) =                                                                       (16)
                                                           ùëÅ


    as the fraction of susceptible individuals at t = ‚àû.

    When ùëÜ1 (‚àû) ‚Üí 1, log(ùëÜ1 (‚àû)) ~ ‚àí (1 ‚àí ùëÜ1 (‚àû)) and ùëÖ ‚Üí 1

    This says that when nobody is infected, ùëÜ1 (‚àû) = 1, i.e. there is no pandemic. This corresponds to
    ùëÖ = 1. It is easy to show that if ùëÖ < 1, there are no solutions to (16) that satisfy 0 ‚â§ ùëÜ1 (‚àû) ‚â§ 1.


    Fitting the Model to Data

    We focus on four North European countries, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Norway,
    denoted by EN, four South European countries, France, Italy, Spain and Germany, denoted by
    ES, and the United Kingdom (UK). Data for the number of confirmed cases and deaths were
    obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data, from an EU agency
    established in 2005 and based in Stockholm with the aim to strengthen Europe‚Äôs defense against
    infectious diseases. The data for the number of tests was obtained from
    https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing [33].

    We note that the data identify the daily number of Confirmed cases, whereas the SIR model we
    described above requires the number of Infected cases. However, the number of confirmed cases
    at time t are derived from the infected cases at some previous time t‚Äô, where the time lag between
    t and t‚Äô is fixed but unknown. Since Equations (1-5) are invariant under a time translation, we can
    use the data for daily confirmed cases to represent ùëã2 with the understanding that there is an
    implicit shift in time between a person becoming infected and being identified as such in the data.
    This shift in time would depend on how quickly infected individuals are identified and included in
    the case count, and hence may vary from country to country. However, we assume that within a

                                                                                                                                       6

    given country, this time interval is fixed on average. With this caveat, in the results below, we will
    use the confirmed daily cases in our analysis to represent ùëã2 (ùë°), and use either the term ‚Äúinfected‚Äù
    or ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù when discussing ùëã2 .

    The first date for which data was available for these countries was 12/31/2019, which we denote
    as day number 0 in our analysis and in the plots to follow. Among the countries considered here,
    the earliest cases were identified in France on 1/25/2020, which corresponds to day 25. In the other
    countries, the earliest cases were identified on the following days, counting from 12/31/2019:
    Netherlands: day 59, Denmark: day 58, Sweden: day 32, Norway: day 58, UK: day 31, Spain: day
    32, Germany: day 28, Italy: day 31.

    The available data includes
    (a) The cumulative number ùêº(ùë°) and daily number ùëã2 (ùë°) of confirmed cases                                       (17)
    and
    (b) The cumulative number ùê∑ (ùë°) and daily number ùëã4 (ùë°) of deaths                                               (18)

    These are related by:
     ùëã2 (ùë°) = ùêº(ùë°) ‚àí ùêº(ùë° ‚àí 1)                                                                                       (19)
    and,
    ùëã4 (ùë°) = ùê∑(ùë°) ‚àí ùê∑(ùë° ‚àí 1) .                                                                                      (20)

    It is worth noting that the dynamics of the number removed each day and the total number of
    removed do not enter our analysis explicitly. Some connection to the full SIR model [29] can be
    made by noting that the total number of removed individuals increases asymptotically at large
    times to ùëÅ(1 ‚àí ùëÜ1 (‚àû)).

    We determine and analyze the following parameters country by country: ùëµ, as defined in (4); ùú∂,
    the transmission rate; i.e. the number of infections per day per contact; ùú∏, the average rate at which
    individuals leave the infected pool; ùëπ , the average number of transmissions per individual; ùëªùëπ ,
    the time between transmissions; ùúπ , the fraction of individuals in the infected pool who will, on
    average, die ùëªùë´ days later; ÔÅ¢ = 1 ‚Äì ùúπ, the fraction of individuals in the infected pool who will, on
    average, recover ùëªùëπùíÜ days later; and ùëªùë≥ , the infective period. We also determine the duration of
    the infection, defined as the number of days from 12/31/19 until the number of deaths drops below
    5 per day.

    The parameters ùëÅ, ùõº, ùõæ, ùëÖ were obtained using (5), (8) and (9) to do numerical fits. Because of
    the definition of R (see (12)), only three of the parameters, ùëÅ, ùõº, ùõæ, ùëÖ, need to be determined from
    the data. Consequently, we proceed as follows:
    1. Using (12), we define ùõº in terms of ùëÅ, ùõæ, ùëÖ. This eliminates ùõº.
    2. Estimating ùëÉ = maximum value of ùëã2 (ùë°) from the data, we determine ùëÅ in terms of ùëÖ using
    (15). This eliminates ùëÅ.
    3. ùõæ(ùëÖ ‚àí 1) is determined as the coefficient of ùë° in the exponential rise of ùëã2 (ùë°) for small t (see
    Appendix A). This eliminates ùõæ.
    4. Using a numerical solver, we vary ùëÖ to fit the observed data for ùëã2 (ùë°).



                                                                                                                                       7

    We emphasize that in determining the parameters, we are only using the ascending limb and the
    peak in the data for ùëã2 (ùë°) and use these to predict how ùëã2 (ùë°) will evolve in time past the peak.
    Using the data for ùëã4 (ùë°) and the fitted model, we can also determine ùëáùê∑ and ùõø using (5a) by a
    simple translation and scaling of the fitted model for ùëã2 (ùë°).

                                                                                                        ùëã (‚àû)
    Furthermore, once ùëÅ, ùõº, ùõæ, ùëÖ are determined, (16) determines ùëÜ1 (‚àû) = 1ùëÅ , the fraction of the
    pool of interacting individuals who are naive (uninfected) at the end of the pandemic.

    Some other useful parameters we obtain are:

    The infective period: ùëáùêø = ùõæ,                                                                                   (21)

    and the average number of transmissions while infective = ùëÅùê∂ =                                 =        =ùëÖ      (23)

    Data and Fitting Methodology

    Although data on deaths is unambiguous, the data for the number of cases is trustworthy only when
    a sufficient number of tests are performed. It is therefore important to determine whether adequate
    testing was done to ensure the reliability of case data. Figure 1a and 1b show the cumulative
    number of tests performed in the countries analyzed, starting from 12/31/2019. We see that in the
    EN countries, the ratio of cumulative tests to cumulative cases always exceeded five, whereas in
    the ES countries and the UK, it always exceeded three. Consequently, we expect that the reported
    number of cases is reliable. It is also important to note that while replicate testing provides some
    assurance, it leaves unaddressed the problem of quality (reliability), breadth (the percentage of the
    population reached) and speed (the elapsed time between infection and identification of disease)
    of testing.

    One interesting observation from the testing data (Figure 1a, 1b) was that initially, public concern
    spread more rapidly than the virus. As the disease spread and testing ramped up, the initial value
    of ùëáùê∂ (number of tests/case) was quite large (over 650 in the UK), suggesting that the exponential
    growth in infections was slower than the exponential public awareness of the disease, resulting in
    the testing of a large number of people with no disease. Later, as appropriate protocols to identify
    diseased individuals were established, ùëáùê∂ decreased then flattened out when the testing capacity
    adequately accounted for new cases, and finally rose again as the pandemic waned.

    The values of ùëã2 (ùë°) and ùëã4 (ùë°) were extracted from the data for the cumulative number of cases
    and the cumulative number of deaths. To reduce fluctuations in these quantities, the data was
    averaged over 7 days. Once B = ùõæ(ùëÖ ‚àí 1) and P were determined from the exponentially
    increasing region and the peak in ùëã2 (ùë°) respectively (see discussion in previous section), the only
    undetermined parameter was ùëÖ. Several values of ùëÖ in the range ùëÖ = 1.5 ‚àí 6.0 were then tested
    using the following procedure: For each parameter set, we fitting these data for ùëã2 (ùë°) from small
    t to the peak and beyond, by finding numerical solutions of (8) and (9) using the Matlab Solver
    myode2 to determine [ùëã1 (ùë°), ùëã2 (ùë°)] as a function of time, with the initial conditions,
    [ùëã1 (ùë°0 ) = ùëÅ ‚àí ùëé, ùëã2 (ùë°0 ) = ùëé], starting from a value ùë°0 of ùë° such that ùëã2 (ùë°0 ) = ùëé ~ 10.

                                                                                                                                       8

    To determine an error on the fitted parameters, the parameters were varied until a range of values
    was found that fit the data for ùëã2 (ùë°) including fluctuations. Finally, ùõø, ùëáùê∑ were emperically
    determined (see eq. (5a)) by scaling and shifting the numerical fits for ùëã2 (ùë°) to fit the data for
    ùëã4 (ùë°). Using the fitted parameters, the numerical solutions for [ùëã1 (ùë°), ùëã2 (ùë°)] were extended to
    estimate the number of days to the end of the pandemic, which we define as when the number of
    daily deaths are less than 5. The fitted solutions for [ùëã2 (ùë°), ùëã4 (ùë°)] were also used to compute the
    predicted total cases per million and the predicted total deaths per million population and compared
    to their actual values in each country. Finally, the values of ùëáùêø and ùëáùëÖ were determined from the
    fitted data using (21) and (22) respectively.

    III. Results and Discussion

    It is important to note that the parameter values we determine are derived solely from: (i) the
    ascending (small t) limb of ùëã2 (ùë°) and (ii) the first peak value of ùëã2 (ùë°). Using the fitted parameters
    to derive results past the peak allows us to: (i) predict how the pandemic would have continued
    beyond the peak, if control measures such as social distancing, use of PPEs and masks etc. had
    remained the same as before the peak; (ii) determine deviations of the actual data from our model
    predictions to estimate the effect of changes in control measures post peak to pandemic dynamics.

    The results obtained for ùëÅ, ùõº, ùõæ, ùëÖ, ùõø, ùëáùêø , ùëáùëÖ , ùëáùê∑ are given in Tables A. Figures 2 and 3 and
    Supplementary Figure S1a-i shows the data and fits of our model for ùëã2 and ùëã4 respectively.
    We note that for Sweden and the UK, there is no clear first peak in ùëã2 (ùë°) but rather a plateau and
    a subsequent increase in the number of daily cases. For these countries, we estimated the value of
    ùëÉ (Eq. 15) from the plateau in Fig. 2c and Fig 2e respectively. For all the other countries, there
    was a clear first peak in ùëã2 (ùë°) whose amplitude was used to estimate P. Unfortunately, for all
    countries, even those that had a well defined first peak in followed by a decline over time, ùëã2 (ùë°)
    showed significant increase soon after the peak. In some cases, subsequent increases in daily
    deaths surpassed these first peaks by factors of 2-6 (Figure 1, S1). These suggest that in spite of
    significant early efforts to control infection rates using social distancing, quarantine, use of masks,
    testing and other containment measures, there was poor success in limiting the spread of the
    disease past the first peak in ùëã2 (Figure 2 a-i), most likely because of a combination of premature
    lifting of quarantine, inadequate use of facemasks and difficulties in limiting physical contacts,
    exacerbated by the advent of summer weather and holiday travel.

    In contrast, for the number of daily deaths ùëã4 (Figure 3 a-i), there were significantly smaller
    increases past the peak for all countries, suggesting that measures to save lives worked better than
    measures to contain the number of infections. This is likely due to the efficiency of the health care
    systems in these countries and the competence and professionalism of health care workers.

    0.03, 0.050 and 0.050 respectively, and the UK, France and Sweden have the highest:
    ùõø = 0.21, 0.20 and 0.18 respectively. Assuming that most of the deaths occurred in hospitals, the
    average time ùëáùê∑ from case identification to death for those who died was highest (12, 15 days) for
    Germany and Norway respectively and lowest (2, 4 days) for Denmark and Italy respectively
    (Figure 4b, Table A).

    It is significant that in each country, the relation between the daily number of cases and the daily
    deaths is described by just two parameters, ùõø and ùëáùê∑ (Eq. 5a), for the entire duration of the
    pandemic. This is not required a priori. For example, pressure on resources during a peak period
    of infectivity might have caused a transient increase in the number of deaths per day relative to the
    number of recovered per day. In such a situation, a single probability ùõø and a single value of
    ùëáùê∑ need not have sufficed for the entire epidemic. The fact that there is little evidence of variations
    in these parameters over the pandemic, to within the quality of the data, suggests that although the
    effectiveness of life saving measures may differ between countries, these measures seem to be
    relatively insensitive to changes in the case burden.

    The average infective period ùëáÃÖùêø = 1/ùõæ was approximately constant for all countries, with an
                                                                                          1

    The duration of the pandemic, the case fatality ratio (deaths/million) and cases/million.

    We define the end of the pandemic as the day when daily deaths becomes less than 5 for the first
    time after first peaking. The duration of the pandemic in each country is shown in Figure 4c as the
    number of days from 12/31/2019 till the day that daily deaths became < 5. With this definition,
    the predicted and actual dates are (Table A) : Netherlands: (6/18 +/- 10 days, 6/17), Denmark:
    (5/11 +/- 4 days, 5/10);, Sweden: (6/28 +/- 10 days, 7/26), Norway: (4/26 +/- 3 days, 4/28), UK:
    (8/5 +/-13 days, 8/21), Spain: (6/29 +/-10 days, 6/29), Germany: (6/24 +/- 9 days, 7/14), France:
    (7/12 +/-12 days, 7/19), Italy: (7/28 +/- 15 days 8/2). Note that the model predictions for pandemic
    duration are in quite good agreement with observation.

    The measured case fatality ratio or the total number of deaths per million population (Table A)
    ranged from low values of 36 and 89 for Norway and Denmark, to high values of 621, 604 and
    582, 562 for the UK, Spain, Italy and Sweden respectively. The model predicted values for this
    quantity are in good agreement with the actual values (Figure 4d).

    The measured total number of cases per million population (Table A) ranged from low values of
    1367 and 1774 for Norway and Denmark to high values of 7375, 5293, 4806 and 4092 for Sweden,
    Spain, Sweden, the UK and Italy respectively. In UK and Spain, the model predictions for this
    quantity were in sharp disagreement with the actual numbers (Figure 4e), likely the result of a
    significant relaxation of containment measures after the peak in the daily cases was reached.

    SARS-Cov-2 may transmit less effectively at higher temperatures.

    As was also noticed in [34], an interesting finding was a weak ‚ÄúTemperature Effect‚Äù on the value
    of the infectivity parameter ùõº. Figure 4f shows the average temperature in February 2020 for the
    principal cities in each country versus the fitted value of ùõº, and suggests that SARS-Cov-2 may
    transmit less efficiently at higher temperatures. However, this result is far from final and needs
    further testing and validation because of many confounding factors, such as humidity, use of air
    conditioning and exhaust fans, crowding, population density etc. that may also have significant
    effects on ùõº.

    In summary, the simple extension of the original SIR model [29] that we propose in this paper is
    able to identify the full set of pandemic parameters and fully characterize all three compartments
    S, I and R. It would be useful to try to understand what policy measures would result in improved
    values for some of these parameters. However, it is also important to recognize that some of the
    parameters cannot be controlled by policy changes, and some that can be will not all respond to
    the same strategy. For example, ùëáùêø can be shortened by increasing the frequency and number of
    tests, since both these strategies increase the number of people removed from the infecting pool.
    On the other hand, the probability that an infected individual will die as opposed to recover might
    be affected by resources such as ventilators and masks. These considerations lead us to ask whether
    the degree of correlation between the parameters of the model, and features of the pandemic such
    as duration and deaths per million population, can account for the wide intercountry variation in
    pandemic features. A low degree of correlation for a particular parameter would indicate that it
    had little influence on variation of the feature, whereas a high degree of correlation would be
    informative.

    To estimate some dependencies that may have useful policy implications, we computed the
    Spearman Correlation between the derived parameters ùëáùêø , NÔÅ°, and ùõø and some metrics of value in
    determining policy ‚Äì namely ‚Äú PD = pandemic duration‚Äù and ‚ÄúCFR = case fatality ratio or deaths
    per million.‚Äù We found that ùëÅÔÅ° was not correlated with these metrics (Correlation with PD: -0.20,
    p-value 0.60; Correlation with CFR: -0.02, p-value 0.98). However, ùëáùêø was somewhat correlated
    (Correlation with PD: 0.64, p-value 0.07; Correlation with CFR: 0.533, p-value 0.15) and ùõø was
    highly correlated (Correlation with PD: 0.86, p-value 0.005; Correlation with CFR: 0.76, p-value
    0.02). These results suggest that the optimum method to decrease both the duration of the pandemic
    and the case fatality ratio would be to decrease the infective period ùëáùêø and ùõø, which are achievable
    by early case identification, contact tracing and quarantine (which would reduce ùëáùêø ) and improving
    quality of care for identified cases (which would reduce ùõø). Whereas these relationships may seem
    obvious, and indeed have been used as mechanisms to limit the impact of the pandemic in many
    countries, the fact that they are also readily identifiable in the data is, in our opinion, quite
    interesting.

    The value of ùëÅÔÅ°, the average number of new infections per day, has clear implications for the time
    it will take a randomized trial to establish therapeutic efficacy. While a statistical analysis is outside
    the scope of this manuscript, we note that the wide inter-country dispersion in this parameter
    indicates that the choice of population could have a pronounced effect on the time to establish
    efficacy, and it might therefore be best to select a test population deliberately from a country or


                                                                                                                                     11

    different countries with no consideration of the average rate of infectivity.

    Figure Legends

    Figure 1: Ratio of the cumulative number of tests to number of identified Covid-19 positive
    cases as a function of time: (a) In the EN countries and (b) in the UK and ES countries. The
    dashed lines in (a) and (b) represent 5 and 3 tests/case respectively.

    Figure 2: Parameter fits for the number of daily cases: Blue circles are observed data for
    ùëã2 (ùë°), the number of cases per day. Solid lines are fits obtained by solving (8) and (9) using the
    ODE solver ode45 in Matlab. The values of the parameters are shown in the insets and represent
    the fit shown as the solid red line. The method used for the fits was to find ùõæ(ùëÖ ‚àí 1) from the
    exponential rise in ùëã2 at early times (Appendix A), estimate the peak value ùëÉ of ùëã2 (which gives
    the value of ùëÅ using (15)) and find an ùëÖ value that best fits the data (red solid line). The black
    lines represent solver results for R varying by 0.5 from the best fit value.

    Figure 3: Number of deaths per day and fits for ùúπ ùêöùêßùêù ùëªùë´ : Red circles are observed data for
    ùëã4 (ùë°), the number of deaths per day. The solid lines were obtained by shifting the fits for ùëã2 (t) in
    Figure 2 forward in time by an amount ùëáùê∑ and scaling the results by ùõø (see eq. 5a).

    Figure 4: Predictions from fits. (a) Best fits for ùëáùê∑ (see eq. 5a and Figure 3), the average number
    of days from case identification to death, if death occurs. Values range from a high of 15 days for
    Norway and a low of 4 days for Italy and Denmark. (b) Best fits for ùõø, (see eq. 5a and Figure 3),
    the fraction of identified cases that died an average of ùëáùê∑ days after case was recorded. Values
    range from low values 0.032, 0.05 and 0.05 for Norway, Denmark and Germany to high values
    0.21, 0.20 and 0.20 for UK, Sweden and France. (c) Predicted and actual number of days from
    12/31/2019 to when number of daily deaths < 5. Note that for all countries, our predictions are
    very close to the actual results. This is also evident from the extrapolation of the fits past the peak
    in Figure 3. This suggests that measures to limit fatalities were just as effective after the peak as
    before. (d) Predicted and actual case fatality ratios (number of deaths per million) from start of the
    pandemic to when daily deaths < 5. Actual values for the case fatality ratios range from lows of
    18 and 76 deaths/million population for Norway and Denmark and highs of 617, 604 and 579
    deaths/million population for UK, Spain and Italy. Note that the predicted values from the fits are
    in good agreement with the actual values for all countries, suggesting consistent medical care
    throughout the pandemic. (e) Predicted and actual cases per million population from start of the
    pandemic to when daily deaths < 5. Note that now, the predicted numbers are in reasonable
    agreement for all countries except UK and Sweden, where preventive measures such as partial
    lockdowns, use of masks and social distancing were not mandated/followed. (e) Identification of
    a possible temperature effect on the infectivity parameter ùõº. The x-axis shows the temperature for
    February 2020 for the principal cities of the countries studied on a linear scale. The results suggest
    that the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with increasing temperature (see also [34]).
