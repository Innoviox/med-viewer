        Coronavirus pandemic that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) appeared in China in 2019 then spread all over the world .COVID-19
firstly appeared in Egypt in Feb 2020. Studies on the thermal stability of the virus is crucial
proper specimens’ transportation for molecular study. Oropharyngeal swabs were taken from
recently infected military people with COVID-19 from Egypt during April 2020. Samples
were aliquoted and the thermal stability of the virus was measured using quantitative real
Time RT-PCR for samples treated at different temperature ranges from 20 °C to 70 °C for
2,4and 6 hours. Results shown that inactivation of the virus and significant reduction in the
ΔCq values begin at 40 °C/4h. Complete virus inactivation and loss of ΔCq values were seen
at 50 °C/6h and 60 °C. Tested samples showed no significant difference in thermal stability
at any temp/time combinations tested.

Key words: quantitative real time RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2. COVID 19; thermal stability; Egyptian isolates.
                                                               Introduction

       A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) also known as COVID-19 has recently emerged
and first recorded in Wuhan city, China in December 2019 (Ali, et al., 2019) with more than
5.7 million infected patients and deaths toll exceeds 357K by the end of May 2020 (WHO,
2020 report -130).

      The first case reported of COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt confirmed on 14 Feb 2020.
By the end of May 2020, there have been about 13K confirmed cases, and nearly 1K deaths.

      SARS-CoV-2 is a member of Beta coronaviridae, single stranded positive sense RNA
viruses which are enveloped viruses that possess extraordinarily large single-stranded RNA
genomes ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length (Zhu et al., 2020)

       Growing evidence of the limitations of qRT-PCR prompts further consideration of the
limitations of this diagnostic test. First, there are already over 7 different SARS-CoV-2
nucleic acid PCR tests (Wang et al., 2020), yet many variation in sensitivity have been seen
which might be extrinsic to the kit construction. Thus information on virus stability with
special regards to its thermal stability and viral integrity of the SARS-CoV-2 in the
environment at diﬀerent temperature conditions is important for understanding virus
transmission, stability, integrity and handling the spacemen’s properly for molecular
diagnoses of the disease.

       In this study, we reported the thermal stability of different SARS-CoV-2 isolates at
different temperatures/ time combination points ranging from 20 °C to 70 °C for 2, 4, and 6
hours as measured by quantitative real time RT-PCR.

                                                   Materials and Methods

       Virus manipulation and RNA extraction were performed in biosafety level three
cabinet (germfree biosafety cabinet, SEA- III, 316 ss).
Samples:
       Oropharyngeal swabs (n=5) were taken from recently infected military patients with
COVID-19 from Egypt during April 2020.The samples transferred in transportation media
(sterile MEM with ampicillin100IU/ml, streptomycin 100μg/ml) at 4 °C in biosafety
transporting device to main chemical laboratories at ALMAZA-Cairo.
Thermal treatment:
       All samples were tested first for the presence of SARS-COV2 virus using virasure®
RT-PCR kit (SARS-CoV-2 Real Time PCR detection KIT high profile. Cat # VS-
NCO212H) , positive samples were subjected to limited dilutions and aliquoted (140μl) in
nuclease free 0.2ml PCR tubes and subjected to temperature of 20 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, 40 °C,
60 °C and 70 °C for 2, 4 and 6 h. using T professional 3000 thermal cycler (Biometra).
RNA extraction:
    RNA from thermally treated and untreated samples were extracted using RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen cat # 52904) according to the manufacture instruction. Briefly, samples were
lysed with 560 µl of buffer AVL at room temperature for 10 min, then 560 µl of absolute
ethanol was added and the whole solution was then placed in the QIA amp Mini column
provided with the kit. The spin columns were centrifuged at 8000 RPM/2min/4°C and
washed with 500µl of washing solution AW1 then AW2. The RNA was eluted in 50µl of
the AVE elution buffer and stored at -80°C till used.

Real time RT-PCR:
        It was done using SARS-CoV-2 Real Time PCR detection KIT high profile. (Cat #
VS-NCO212H) according to the manufacture instructions, briefly, the master mix was
rehydrated with 15µL of rehydration Buffer and 5 µL of RNA of thermally treated and
untreated samples were added ( samples were run in duplicates) , positive and negative
controls ( provided with the kit ) were included in each test to judge the quality of
amplification. Real time RT-PCR was done using Ariamx thermal cycler (Agilent, Germany)
with the following parameters, reverse transcription step at 45oC/15 minute, followed by
initial denaturing and enzyme activation step at 95oC/2 minute, then 45 cycled of denaturing
at 95°C/10 sec and annealing/extension 60 °C/50 seconds with florescence collected at the
end of this step.
        Results presented as the mean ΔCq values of the triplicated for each sample (mean Cq
of the thermally treated sample – Mean Cq of the thermally untreated sample) and considered
negative when there is no amplification (Cq ≥45) which means that there is no amplification
and the virus completely inactivated (lost its integrity)
Statistical analysis:
        The ΔCq values were tested for significant at CI of 95% (Two way ANOVA) using
IPM-SPP package V21. Data presented as mean ΔCq values of the triplicated of 5 samples
tested at each temperature/time combination points. Data were graphically presented using
graph pad Prism V8.0.2

                                                                Results:

       Samples used in the current study were collected from clinically morbid patients with
the classical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 including hyperthermia (>38.5°C) dyspnea, dry
cough, and atypical pneumonia as confirmed by chest X rays. Oropharyngeal swabs were
taken and confirmed positive for the presence of the virus using qRT-PCR (fig1 and 2). All
samples gave positive Cq value ranging from (21.56-28.10) for orf1 gene and (23.10 -29.42)
for the N gene.
       Samples with high viral titer were then aliquoted and thermally treated, the relative
quantitation of both orf1 and N genes were done to examine the effect of each thermal/time
combination point on the virus integrity. As then in table 1, fig (3 and 4) temp up to 40°C
for up to 4 h did not significantly affect the mean relative Cq values for the orf1 gene were
as at 40°C/6h the results became significantly (P ≤0.05) differed which means that the virus
inactivation starts. At 50 °C the virus begin to lose its integrity. Complete virus inactivation
was found at 60 °C/ 6h and at 70°C /2h.
       For the N gene, nearly the same results obtained as the virus remain stable when
subjected to 40 °C/4h , increase temp and /or time results in rapid deterioration of the virus
integrity and sever decrease in the relative Cq value.
       All tested 5 isolates showed no difference in thermal susceptibility as the variance in
the slandered deviation were very low and there were no significant difference in the ΔC q
values

                                                             Discussion:

       SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces at room temperature for up
to 9 day ( Pan et al., 2020) At a temperature of 30 °C or more the duration of persistence is
shorter (Kampf et al., 2020). In the current study we discussed the possibility of thermal
stability of SARS-CoV-2 in different temp as measured by qRT-PCR.
       Virus inactivation as measured by real time PCR is a quick hazardless approach to test
virus stability without the need for Tissue culture procedures. Thermal time combination
treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 revealed that the inactivation of the virus begin at 40°C/6h ,
complete inactivation was achieved at 50°C/4h and 60°C/4h when measured by
amplification of orf1 gene , whereas using N gene amplification , complete inactivation was
achieved at 50°C/4 h and 60°C/2h. these results indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 as all other
coronavirus are heat sensitive and can be activated at a temp of 50 °C. The same results were
obtained when the infectivity of the virus was tested using TCID50 after incubation at
different temperatures, (Chin et al., 2020). The virus was highly stable at 4°C (there was
only ∼0.7-log unit reduction of infectious titer on Day 14). With the incubation
temperature being increased to 70°C, the time for virus inactivation was reduced to 5
minutes.(Chin et al., 2020) whereas virus subjected to 56 °C /30 min resulted in complete
loss of virus infectivity when measured by TCID50.
       Studies on the infectious bronchitis virus ( one of the avian viruses belonging to the
gamma coronaviridae) revealed that the virus is highly thermal unstable at temp of 50 °C
and it needs a high salt concentration ( nearly 1M of Na 2Hpo4) to maintain its infectivity ,
yet it became completely in-infective at 60 °C. (Hopkins, 1967). Other studies on avian
coronaviridae showed difference in thermal stability between different strains (Otsuki et al.,
1979) , although most strains were completely inactivated at 45 °C30 min some isolates like
IB-41 and IB- KH maintained very low activity even at a temp beyond 60°C/1h.
       In our study we could not find any thermal stability variations among the tested 5
isolates indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 may not yet evolve to maintain its infectivity at a
higher temp outside the host cells.

                                                            Conclusion:

Our study revealed that thermal inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 can be achieved at 50°C/6h or
60 °C/2h and that, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR does not affected by lower
temperature / time combination. Variation in thermal stability did not recognized among the
5 tested isolates of SAES-CoV-2 from patients in Egypt. Further investigation using cell
