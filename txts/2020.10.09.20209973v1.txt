   Abstract
   Background: The RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine is currently being piloted in three African
   countries. We sought to identify whether vaccination could reach additional children who are
   at risk from malaria but do not currently have access to, or use, core malaria interventions.
   Methods: Using data from household surveys we calculated the overlap between malaria
   intervention coverage and childhood vaccination (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis dose 3, DTP3)
   uptake in 20 African countries with at least one first administrative level unit with Plasmodium
   falciparum parasite prevalence greater than 10%. We used multilevel logistic regression to
   explore patterns of overlap by demographic and socioeconomic variables. We also estimated
   the public health impact of delivering RTS,S/AS01 to those children who do not use an
   insecticide-treated        net (ITN) but who received the DTP3 vaccine.

   Results: Uptake of DTP3 was higher than malaria intervention coverage in most countries.
   Overall, 34% of children did not use ITNs and received DTP3, while 35% of children used
   ITNs and received DTP3, although this breakdown varied by country. We estimated that there
   are 33 million children in these 20 countries who do not use an ITN. Of these, 23 million (70%)
   received the DTP3 vaccine. Vaccinating those 23 million children who receive DTP3 but do
   not use an ITN could avert an estimated 9.7 million clinical malaria cases each year. An
   additional 10.8 million cases could be averted by vaccinating those 24 million children who
   receive the vaccine and use an ITN. Children who had access to or used an ITN were 9 to 13%
   more likely to reside in rural areas compared to those who had neither intervention regardless
   of vaccination status. Mothers’ education status was a strong predictor of intervention uptake
   and was positively associated with use of ITNs and vaccination uptake and negatively
   associated with having access to an ITN but not using it. Wealth was also a strong predictor of
   intervention coverage.
   Conclusions: Childhood vaccination to prevent malaria has the potential to reduce inequity in
   access to existing malaria interventions and could substantially reduce the childhood malaria
   burden in sub-Saharan Africa, even in regions with lower existing DTP3 coverage.

   Background
   The introduction of the Millennium Development Goals in 2000 helped to catalyse widespread
   scale-up of core contemporary malaria control interventions in sub-Saharan Africa: insecticide
   treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), chemoprevention for pregnant women,
   and more recently, chemoprevention of children in areas of seasonal transmission [1].
   Access to treatment of clinical malaria with artemisinin-based combination therapy also
   increased [1]. Although malaria burden has declined significantly over the previous two

   decades, malaria remains a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. Worldwide in
   2018 there were an estimated 228 million cases of malaria and 405,000 deaths, with over 90%
   of the deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa [2]. Funding for malaria has remained relatively
   stable since 2010, but the level of investment remains far short of what is required under the
   WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria (GTS) [3]. The first milestone for burden and
   mortality reduction under the GTS, namely a reduction of at least 40% in malaria incidence
   and mortality globally by 2020 compared with 2015 levels [3], is therefore unlikely to be met.
   Between 2016 and 2018, 578 million ITNs were delivered globally, compared to a total of 582
   million between 2014 and 2016 [2, 4]. However, reported usage of ITNs has improved only
   marginally since 2015 [2]. In addition, fewer people at risk of malaria are being protected by
   IRS; globally, IRS protection declined from a peak of 5% in 2010 to 2% in 2018 [2].
   Furthermore, a high proportion of febrile children do not receive medical care (median: 36%,
   IQR: 28–45% based on a separate analysis of 20 household surveys conducted in sub-Saharan
   Africa between 2015 and 2018) [2]. Uptake of these interventions varies within and between
   countries and is not evenly distributed across demographic and socioeconomic strata [5–7].
   While vector control has generally been identified as being more equitable – with ITN
   distribution in particular identified as “pro-poor” – wealth inequities persist [5, 8] and
   Webster et al. [7] found that ever-treated net coverage was strongly biased towards richer
   households in almost all countries included in their study.
   Vaccination is one of the most successful and cost-effective public health measures, and has
   the potential to greatly reduce inequity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries [9,
   10]. The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) has been a key catalyst in expanding
   access to childhood vaccines, with an estimated 86% coverage of DTP3 globally and 78%

   coverage in Africa in 2018 [11]. However, gaps in coverage do remain, with higher levels of
   inequality in countries with lower vaccine uptake and evidence of “pro-rich” coverage in some
   countries [12, 13]. Identifying those that are not receiving basic vaccines is therefore a priority
   [14, 15]. The majority of children who remain unvaccinated are geographically concentrated,
   with 60% of these children residing in ten countries (including four malaria endemic countries
   in Africa: Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, and Nigeria) [14].
   The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine for P. falciparum malaria is the first vaccine to show partial
   protection against clinical and severe malaria in children. The multi-site phase 3 trial of the
   RTS,S vaccine demonstrated 39.0% (95% CI 34.3–43.3%) protective efficacy against clinical
   malaria in young children who received all four doses, over four years of follow-up according
   to the per-protocol population [16]. Pilot implementation of the vaccine is now underway in
   three African countries – Ghana, Kenya and Malawi [17] – and the findings from this pilot will
   inform public health policy decisions about wider roll-out of the vaccine, including the
   potential for RTS,S to be incorporated in the EPI [18].
   In this study we sought to quantify the overlap and gaps between malaria intervention coverage
   and childhood vaccination uptake in malaria-endemic African countries. Using data from
   household-based Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), we stratified individual children
   into groups on the basis of reported ITN coverage (ownership and usage) and DTP3 vaccination
   status [19]. We used these groupings to explore socio-economic factors driving intervention
   uptake and to quantify the potential that introduction of the RTS,S vaccine could have in
   reducing malaria burden in those who are not currently accessing or using ITNs.

   Data sources
   Data were obtained from DHS and Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) in Africa [19]. Both are
   large, nationally representative, household surveys typically conducted every three to four
   years. In our initial scope we included all African countries with at least one administrative 1
   (admin-1) unit with P. falciparum parasite prevalence in 2–10-year-old individuals (PfPR2-10)
   greater than 10% based on Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) estimates for 2016 [20]. This threshold
   was chosen as the level above which the RTS,S malaria vaccine has been estimated to be highly
   cost-effective [21]. Twenty-six countries fitted our inclusion criteria. For each, we identified
   the most recent DHS and MIS where geolocation data and parasite prevalence data were also
   available. Geolocation data were not available for South Sudan, Equatorial Guinea or Niger,
   and prevalence data were not available for Chad, Gabon or the Central African Republic. These
   countries were therefore excluded from the analysis. This resulted in 20 countries eligible for
   analysis with a median country-level parasite prevalence of PfPR2-10 = 23% (range 5–43%).
   The DHS and/or MIS dataset used for each country is listed in the (Table S1).
   To quantify vaccination uptake, we extracted individual-level data on the childhood
   vaccination status of DTP3 (administered at 14 weeks of age) and measles (administered at
   nine months of age) for children aged 12–35 months from the DHS. We defined a child as
   having received DTP3 if they had received three doses and measles if they had received the
   first dose. This could be recorded by a mark on a vaccine card or a mother’s response. DTP3
   and measles vaccine coverage were found to be highly correlated at the country level (Figure
   S2) and therefore we used DTP3 vaccination status as an indicator of access to vaccination.
   All DHS and MIS collect information on ITNs, therefore data on ITN access and usage could
   be linked to data on vaccination uptake at the individual level. We defined a child as using an

   ITN if they slept in the house on the previous night and used either an ITN, or both an ITN and
   untreated net, that previous night. We defined a child as having access to a net if they slept in
   the house on the previous night and had a mosquito bed net for sleeping. We did not consider
   IRS due to the low global percentage of households protected by this method.
   Data on P. falciparum malaria prevalence and the proportion of children seeking treatment for
   fever were not consistently available in all DHS surveys and therefore could only be matched
   at the country or admin-1 level, using MIS data where possible (Table S1). Treatment coverage
   was defined as the proportion of children aged between 12–59 months for whom fever was
   reported within the previous two weeks and who sought medical treatment. P. falciparum
   malaria prevalence was based on rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results in children aged between
   12–59 months. The prevalence data were not included in the survey data sets for two countries
   (Cameroon and Zambia), therefore these values were obtained from the corresponding reports
   (Table S1). All country and admin-1 coverage estimates were adjusted using the reported
   sample weights according to the DHS guidance [19].
   We extracted data on gender, age, rural/urban status, the highest level of the mother’s education
   and the wealth index to explore additional determinants underlying variation in access to
   vaccines and malaria interventions. These variables are included in the DHS and were therefore
   matched to vaccination status, ITN access and ITN usage at the individual level. All data were
   extracted using the rdhs package in R software [22].
   Analysis
   We defined six groups based on the vaccination status, ITN access and ITN usage for each
   child:

        1) Did not receive the DTP3 vaccine and did not have access to or sleep under an ITN;
        2) Did not receive the DTP3 vaccine and had access to, but did not sleep under, an ITN;
        3) Did not receive the DTP3 vaccine but did sleep under an ITN;
        4) Received the DTP3 vaccine but did not have access to or sleep under an ITN;
        5) Received the DTP3 vaccine had access to, but did not sleep under, an ITN;
        6) Received the DTP3 vaccine and slept under an ITN.
   The first group we term “missed children” since these children do not have access to an ITN
   and are also unlikely to benefit from the introduction of the malaria vaccine introduced via the
   EPI. The fourth and fifth groups we term “prospective children” since these children are not
   currently using ITNs but could be accessed via EPI to receive the malaria vaccine. Differences
   in the distribution of children by group between countries were evaluated using a Chi-squared
   test.
   We fitted a multinomial mixed effect model for nominal (unordered) outcomes to explore the
   determinants of overlap in vaccine coverage and ITN access and usage. This allowed groups
   2–6 to be contrasted against the reference group (the “missed children”), while accounting for
   variation at the country level using a random intercept [23, 24]. The following variables were
   considered during the model building process: age of the child; malaria prevalence of the region
   in which the child lived; sex of the child; mother’s education level; and whether the region in
   which a child lived was classified as rural or urban. We did not consider clustering at the survey
   cluster level because there were very few observations associated with each survey cluster.
   Prevalence was not found to be a significant variable and was subsequently removed from the
   model. These analyses were undertaken using SAS version 9.4 [25].

   We estimated the number of children aged 12–59 months at risk of malaria for each country by
   multiplying the proportion of children in each group at the at the admin-1 level by the at-risk
   population for each admin-1 unit and aggregating it to the country level. Demographic and
   population data were obtained from the United Nations World Population Prospects 2015 and
   2016 projections respectively [26]. The population-at-risk was then calculated using at-risk
   proportions obtained by masking regions designated outside the spatial limits of P. falciparum
   [27]. We then estimated the number of cases that could be averted by the vaccine in prospective
   children using the at-risk populations of the prospective group who received the DTP3 vaccine
   but did not use an ITN (groups 4 and 5). We also calculated the number of cases averted for
   those who already have a vaccine and use an ITN (group 6). We assumed 100% coverage of
   the malaria vaccine across the children who received DTP3 in these three groups and that the
   vaccine reduces the clinical incidence of malaria across this age group by 39% irrespective of
   whether they used an ITN [28]. We calculated the number of cases averted at the admin-1 level
   and aggregated at the country level. To obtain the clinical incidence prior to vaccine
   introduction, we used a model-based relationship between parasite prevalence and clinical
   incidence (Figure S2) to translate the estimates of parasite prevalence by RDT in children
   younger than five years from the corresponding DHS or MIS [29].
   Results
   Figure 1 shows the country-level relationship between DTP3 vaccine coverage and three
   malaria intervention coverage indicators (ITN usage, ITN access and the proportion of fever
   cases seeking treatment). Across the majority of countries, vaccination coverage was higher
   than any of the selected malaria intervention coverage indicators. The highest levels of malaria
   intervention coverage were access to ITNs; with eight of the 20 of the countries analysed
   having higher ITN access compared to vaccination coverage (Angola, Benin, Cote d’Ivoire,

   DRC, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria and Uganda). However, this difference was only substantial
   (>10%) in three of these countries (Benin, Malawi and Nigeria). Furthermore, there was a
   consistent gap between ITN access and ITN usage in all countries. ITN usage was therefore
   lower than vaccination coverage in all but three countries (Benin, DRC and Mali). Only one
   country (Angola) had lower vaccine coverage than proportion of children seeking treatment for
   fever.
   Overall, 34% of children did not use ITNs but received the DTP3 vaccine, and 35% of children
   both used ITNs and received the DTP3 vaccine (Table 1). There was significant variation in
   the overlap between ITN use and DTP3 vaccine uptake between countries (chi-squared test,
   p<0.001). The highest proportion of children who received no DTP3 vaccine and did not use
   an ITN were in south-western Africa, whereas the lowest proportion were in the south east of
   Africa (Figure 2A). In contrast, the highest proportion of children who received the DTP3
   vaccine and did not use an ITN were in south-eastern Africa and the lowest were south-western
   Africa (Figure 2B). Examining unvaccinated children, 16% of children used ITNs but were not
   vaccinated, and 15% of children did not receive either intervention.
   We estimated that in the 20 countries analysed there are 33 million children at risk of malaria
   who currently do not use an ITN (Table 1). Of these, 23 million (70%) are in the “prospective”
   group that did receive the DTP3 vaccine and hence could potentially receive protection from
   the malaria vaccine under existing distribution channels. Cameroon, Democratic Republic of
   Congo, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda each have more than one million
   children in this group. However, Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria each
   have more than one million children in the “missed children” category who did not receive the
   DTP3 vaccine and do not have access to a net. Across the 20 countries, approximately the same

   number of children in the “prospective” group, who do not currently use an ITN, had access to
   an ITN than did not despite individual countries having very different levels of overall access
   to ITNs. This pattern was repeated in the “missed children” group.
   By vaccinating all children in the “prospective” group (children who receive DTP3 but are not
   protected by an ITN), an estimated 9.7 million malaria cases could be averted each year across
   these 20 countries (Table 2). An additional 10.8 million cases could be averted by vaccinating
   those 23 million children who both use an ITN and have the DTP3 vaccine. Despite the
   relatively low vaccination coverage levels in Nigeria, 30% of total cases averted would be
   averted by vaccinating children in this country with a further 22% in two additional countries
   – Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
   The association between demographic and socioeconomic variables and the different
   intervention coverage groups are shown in Figure 3. Older children (aged 24–35 months) were
   less likely to have received the DTP3 vaccine and use an ITN compared to younger children
   (aged 12–23 months). There were notable differences in intervention coverage between rural
   and urban populations; those that had access to or used a net were more likely to reside in rural
   areas compared to the missed children regardless of vaccination status (p=0.034) whereas those
   that received the DTP3 vaccine, but did not have access to a net, were more likely to reside in
   urban areas compared to the missed children (p=0.006). The mother’s education status was
   strongly associated with intervention uptake with membership of all intervention groups that
   either used an ITN and/or received the DTP3 vaccine (groups 3, 4, 5 and 6) being significantly
   associated with higher levels of education (p<0.001). Furthermore, membership of the group
   that did not receive the vaccine and had access to a net but did not use it (group 2) was
   significantly less likely in those that had received higher education compared to those that

   received little or no education. The wealth index was also a strong predictor of intervention
   coverage. Membership of all intervention groups that either had received the DTP3 vaccine, or
   owned and/or used a net, was significantly associated with higher wealth levels after we
   controlled for the urban/rural divide. Those receiving higher incomes were approximately
   twice as likely to access both nets and vaccines (groups 5 and 6) compared to those in the lower
   wealth quintile (p<0.001). The numbers of children in each group are provided in Table S2.
   Discussion
   The substantial declines in the burden of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa since 2010 have been
   attributed primarily to the rapid increase in access and usage of ITNs alongside slower but
   significant improvements in access to first-line treatment [30]. However, in more recent years
   the coverage of both interventions has plateaued, with the most recent household surveys
   analysed here demonstrating sub-optimal levels of ITN usage in many countries (at or below
   50%) and even lower rates of treatment seeking for fever. In contrast, supported by the
   establishment of Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance in 2000 and the World Health Organization’s
   EPI, uptake of childhood vaccination has steadily increased, although the past decade has seen
   some stagnation [14, 31]. As demonstrated by our analysis, vaccine coverage is high in most
   of the 20 countries studied here, with only two countries (Angola and Guinea) reporting under
   50% uptake in their most recent DHS. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that coverage of
   vaccines administered via the EPI is substantially higher than usage of ITNs or fever treatment-
   seeking rates in the majority of countries, which is consistent with other research [7]. This
   creates an opportunity to consider roll-out strategies for the introduction of a malaria vaccine
   that are distinct to implementation programs for other malaria interventions, to maximise
   impact by building on the wider reach of the EPI programme.

   As noted elsewhere, the utilisation of malaria interventions and uptake of vaccination were
   found to be strongly associated with demographic and socioeconomic indicators [5–8, 12, 13].
   Perhaps not surprisingly given the differing distribution mechanisms, those accessing and using
   ITNs were more likely to reside in rural areas whereas as higher uptake of the DTP3 vaccine
   was associated with urban areas, possibly as a result of better access to healthcare facilities.
   Uptake of vaccination was also strongly associated with both the mother’s educational level
   and the wealth quintile, although as noted elsewhere, even at lower levels of education and
   wealth, the coverage of vaccination remained high [13]. Access to ITNs and ITN usage were
   also both strongly associated with the mother’s education status and wealth; however, having
   access to a net but not using it whilst also not being vaccinated with DTP3 was more strongly
   associated with lower educational status of mothers than with wealth.
   We estimate that there are currently 33 million children in these 20 countries who are not using
   an ITN. Of these, 23 million (70% of the total children without an ITN) are estimated to have
   received the DTP3 vaccine and hence could be reached by the EPI programme. If the RTS,S
   malaria vaccine were made available to just these 23 million children, we estimate that 9.7
   million cases (or 0.44 cases per vaccinated child) could be averted each year (assuming all
   children who receive the DTP3 vaccine also receive the RTS,S). If the vaccine was also
   administered to those children with an ITN and who were vaccinated (24 million additional
   children), we estimate an additional 10.8 million cases or (0.47 cases per vaccinated child)
   could also be averted. Around 40% of the total cases would be averted in the Democratic
   Republic of Congo and Nigeria, countries which are currently contributing large proportions
   of malaria cases worldwide. This alone could represent a substantial reduction in the global
   malaria burden, reducing P. falciparum malaria cases by approximately 4%. However, there
   are still 9.8 million children across our countries of interest who would remain unprotected by

   either intervention; these “missed children” should remain the focus of initiatives to improve
   equity in access to both malaria interventions and vaccination.
   There are several limitations to this analysis. First, we were only able to undertake the analysis
   for 20 of the 27 malaria-endemic countries of interest within sub-Saharan Africa. Those
   countries for which data were not available contributed around 10% of the Africa malaria
   burden in 2018 and therefore also remain an important target for both malaria interventions
   and vaccination [2]. Second, due to the different survey designs, we were not able to link
   vaccination status and access to treatment at the individual level. Given that both rely on access
   to health services, it is likely that these may be correlated, although levels of access to treatment
   remain well below vaccination rates. An alternative equity dimension that may be relevant to
   consider when targeting malaria interventions could be the potential for access to rapid
   treatment since both severe disease incidence and malaria mortality have been associated with
   the time taken to reach care [32, 33]. Third, to estimate the impact of the RTS,S vaccine on
   malaria burden we used the mean estimate of vaccine efficacy across the phase 3 trial sites over
   a four-year period (39%). As usage of ITNs during the trial was very high, this likely represents
   an under-estimate of the true impact of the vaccine in this group of prospective children. A
   study using RTS,S trial and bed net usage in Malawi estimated that vaccinating a child in urban
   Lilongwe without a bed net could prevent 1.09 malaria cases, versus 0.67 for a child with a bed
   net. In rural Lilongwe, 2.59 and 1.59 malaria cases could be averted, respectively [34].
   Furthermore, in taking this simple approach to estimating vaccine impact, we have ignored the
   differences in vaccine efficacy by endemicity that were observed in the trial, and the potential
   age-shifting of cases that would likely occur as a result of reduced exposure to infection [35].
   Fourth, we also assume universal malaria vaccine coverage for children who receive the DTP3
   vaccine, which results in our estimate of cases averted being an upper bound. The RTS,S

   vaccine is delivered as a four-dose schedule, with the first and third doses aligning with existing
   EPI contact points. Therefore, particularly in the early phase of vaccine introduction, it is
   possible that vaccine coverage could be lower than that of DTP3. Projected vaccine coverage
   will be informed by data from the pilot studies as they progress. Finally, our analysis is based
   on self-reported vaccination status and ITN use from household surveys across different years;
   as such they are not directly comparable with estimates produced by WHO (for malaria
   interventions and vaccination) and UNICEF (for vaccination) which are obtained by
   triangulating data from a number of sources.
   Conclusions
   In summary, broadly high levels of childhood vaccination across malaria-endemic countries in
   sub-Saharan Africa, including in high P. falciparum prevalence regions where take-up of
   current interventions remains sub-optimal, provide an opportunity to maximise the impact of
   childhood malaria vaccination. Older children were less likely to have received the DTP3
   vaccine and use an ITN compared to younger children and the higher the levels of mother’s
   education and wealth indexes, the greater the intervention coverage. Our study also highlights
   the considerable number of children who are not currently accessing routine childhood
   immunisations or core malaria interventions and who should be the focus of health equity
   initiatives in order to improve access. These combined findings allow for the identification of
   populations that could benefit most from the introduction of a childhood malaria vaccine and
   could be used to devise strategies for future malaria vaccine implementation.

   Table 2: Estimated malaria cases averted. The numbers of cases, and percentage relative to
   the total across all countries, that could be averted annually in 12–59-month-old children if
   universal coverage of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine was achieved, for those who received the DPT3
   vaccine in each country. These estimated are calculated for individual admin-1 units and

   Figure 3: The relationship between demographic and socioeconomic variables and
   intervention coverage. Odd’s ratio estimates, 95% confidence levels and p values are shown
   for each of the predictors. All ratios are comparative to group 1 where children did not receive
   the DTP3 vaccine and have no access to an ITN (the “missed children”). Children in group 2
   did not receive the DTP3 vaccine and had access to, but did not sleep under, an ITN; children
   in group 3 did not receive the DTP3 vaccine but did sleep under an ITN; children in group 4
   received the DTP3 vaccine but did not have access to or sleep under an ITN; children in group
   5 received the DTP3 vaccine and had access to, but did not sleep under, an ITN; and children
   in group 6 received the DTP3 vaccine and slept under an ITN.
