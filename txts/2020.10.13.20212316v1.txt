ABSTRACT
Background: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are lipophilic, persistent endocrine disrupting
chemicals often used as flame retardants in products that were widely produced in the United States until 2004.
The potential for environmental toxicants such as PBDEs to disrupt normal neuroendocrine pathways resulting
in depression and other neurological symptoms has been largely understudied. This study examined whether
PBDE exposure in pregnant women was associated with antenatal depressive symptomatology.
Methods: This study is part of a larger longitudinal pregnancy and birth cohort study. Data were collected from
193 African American pregnant women at 8-14 weeks gestation. Serum PBDEs were analyzed using gas
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) was used to identify
depressive symptoms experienced in the last seven days prior to biosampling. The dichotomous depression
variable was used to explore varying high-risk EDS cutoffs and illustrated with receiver operating characteristic
curves. Logistic regression models were constructed to investigate associations with antenatal depression and a
weighted quantile sum (WQS) index was calculated to account for the mixture of PBDE congeners.
Results: Of the total sample, 52 women (26.9%) were categorized as having a high risk of depression. PBDE
congeners -47, -99, and -100 were detected in 50% or more of the samples tested. BDE-47 was positively
associated with depressive symptoms (β =2.36, p=0.05). The risk of being mild to moderately depressed
increased by a factor of 4.52 for BDE-47 (CI 1.50, 13.60) and 1.58 for BDE-99 (CI 1.08, 2.29). The WQS
index, a weighted estimate of the body burden of the congener mixture was positively associated with a higher
risk of mild to moderate depression using an EDS cutoff ≥10 (OR=2.93; CI 1.18, 7.82).
Conclusion: BDE-47 and -99 exposures are significantly associated with depressive symptomatology in a
pregnant cohort. These exposures will likely continue for years due to slow chemical degradation. Interventions
should focus on PBDE mitigation to reduce toxic neuroendocrine effects on vulnerable pregnant women.
BACKGROUND
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a family of chemicals with a common structure of a diphenyl ether
molecule attached to one to ten bromine atoms. PBDEs were once added to consumer products and materials to
attenuate the risk of fire and to increase the escape time in the event of a fire. A voluntary phase-out of
pentaBDEs and octaBDEs began in the United States in 2004 and later, decaBDEs, however, they remain
prevalent in the environment over 10 years later. PBDE chemicals are not covalently bound to materials and
leach from consumer products into the environment. Additionally, they are not easily biodegraded and thus
remain persistent and ubiquitous in the environment. Levels of PBDEs in humans and the environment are
higher in North America than in other regions of the world, likely because of the widespread commercial use of
PBDE mixtures in the United States: decaBDE and pentaBDE (widely used in textiles, plastics, electronics, and
polyurethane foam)(EPAb, 2006). The chemicals are highly detectable in air, dust, sediment, soil, and ground
water (ATSDR, 2017) and, with their hydrophobic properties, PBDEs can bioaccumulate in lipid-rich human
tissue (NTP, 2014). Exposure to PBDEs has been associated with thyroid disease (Vuong, 2018; Byrne, 2018;

Chen, 2018), reproductive changes (Harley, 2010), neurodevelopmental deficits (Kuriyama, 2005; Shy et
al., 2011; Hoffman et al., 2012; Bradman et al., 2012; Eskenazi et al., 2011, 2013), and gestational diabetes
(Liu, 2018). The potential for environmental toxicants such as PBDEs to disrupt normal neuroendocrine
pathways resulting in depression and other neurological symptoms has been largely unstudied. Literature
regarding PBDE exposure and subsequent short- and long-term health effects has focused on neurological
effects among infants and children. To date, only two studies have investigated the effects of PBDE exposure
outside of pregnancy and subsequent neuropsychological effects (Gump, 2014; Fitzgerald, 2012). In this study,
we focus on PBDE exposure in pregnant adults and their relationship with depressive symptoms.
Clear connections between PBDE levels and thyroid disruption have been made (Vuong, 2018; Guo, 2018;
Byrne, 2018; Chen 2018; Ding, 2017; Zheng, 2017) PBDEs have similar shape and structure to thyroid
hormones and are thought to mimic thyroid activities as a result. Further, the essentiality of thyroid homeostasis
for cognition and mood stability has been long recognized (Hendrick, 1998; Joffee, 1994; Esposito, 1997;
Bathla, 2016). Of the two available studies investigating PBDE exposure and risk of depression within the same
individual, no associations were found. However, measures of hostility, aggression, and temperament among
children were significantly correlated with PBDE concentrations (Gump, 2014). In another study of older adults
with high occupational polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure, significant associations were found between
the mixture of PCBs and PBDEs and learning and memory (Fitzgerald, 2012). PCBs and PBDEs have been
postulated to share mechanistic actions and toxic effects (Sethi 2017, Herbstman 2010; Dingemans 2016;
Harley 2010) and others endocrine disrupting chemicals and have been correlated with depression-like
symptoms as well (Fitzgerald, 2007; Fitzgerald, 2012; Xu, 2015; Braun, 2011; Engel, 2010).
Pregnant women may be an overlooked vulnerable population to the effects of toxicants due to normal
physiological changes in pregnancy such as higher lipid profiles and thyroid strain (Lignell, 2016; Tan, 2013;
Budenhofer, 2013). African Americans (AAs) specifically may also be at elevated risk of toxicant exposure and
depression. According to the most recent 2003-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) population data, non-Hispanic blacks have elevated PBDE body burden when compared to non-
Hispanic whites (Sjodin, 2008; Sjodin, 2014). Cross-sectional studies have found similar findings predicting
non-Hispanic blacks are nine times more likely to have high concentrations of persistent organic pollutants
(which include PBDEs) than non-Hispanic whites after adjusting for income (Pumarega, 2016).
AA women may also be at increased risk for perinatal depression- a mood disorder present in the antenatal or
postpartum period for up to one year. Melville et al. (2010) estimated nearly 19% of AA women met diagnostic
criteria for either minor or major depression during pregnancy, considerably higher than the national average of
8.5% (Tanden, 2012). African American women of low income have the highest reported prevalence of
perinatal depression (28%) in the U.S. (CDC). Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with adverse
outcomes in many aspects of role performance (Kessler 2012). Specifically, MDD is associated with poor
outcomes in marital functioning (cite), parental functioning (cite), absenteeism and low work performance
(cite), and personal income or household earnings (cite). Unfortunately, some populations of African Americans
are less likely to be diagnosed and treated for depressive symptoms compared to white patients (Gallo et al.,
2005), and across subgroups, African Americans are more likely to have persistent disorders after becoming ill
(Breslau 2005). Additionally, mental health concerns are often overlooked, misdiagnosed, mistreated, or not
treated and, historically, both patients and providers have poor follow-up of mental health concerns.
It is also widely accepted that not all populations conform to the standard EDS scoring criteria. The EDS has
been validated in multiple race and ethnic groups (Kozinszky, 2015, Cox, 1987) with varied cut-off scores
recommended to accurately predict a diagnosis of mild to moderate depression resulting from socioeconomic
status (Tanden, 2012), race (Tanden, 2012), and gender (Matthey, 2001) differences. Additionally, researchers
have argued that cultural differences and timing of screenings influence clinical cut-off scores (Tandon 2012,
Chaudron et al., 2010; Gjerdingen et al., 2009; Sheeder et al., 2009; Logsdon & Myers, 2010).

Few quantitative studies have examined health effects of PBDE exposures in pregnant women and, to our
knowledge, none have studied AA women. For these reasons, we designed our study to investigate whether
PBDE exposure in pregnant AA women is associated with depressive symptomatology during pregnancy. Due
to uncertainty in applicability of standard EDS cutoff scores to our vulnerable population of pregnant AA
women, we took additional measures to ensure appropriate cutoff scores were utilized in our analysis. We
hypothesized a positive relationship would be found between PBDE serum concentration and depression among
pregnant AA women.
METHODS
This study used data drawn from a larger longitudinal pregnancy and birth cohort aimed to investigate the
maternal prenatal microbiome as a predictor of birth outcomes (Corwin, 2017). Women were enrolled in the
study between 2014 and 2017 and were included if they self-identified as AA, had a singleton pregnancy, were
18-35 years of age, resided in the Atlanta Georgia area, and could comprehend and speak English. Women were
recruited during their first trimester from prenatal clinics serving two local hospitals. Members of this SES-
diverse cohort were individually informed of the study protocol and written consent was obtained. Participants
were followed through delivery. For this analysis, a subset of 193 women were included if they had serum
PBDE concentrations and complete EDS scores. All study procedures were approved and reviewed by the
Institutional Review Board at Emory University.
Measures
Pregnancy dating was based on the participant’s known last menstrual period or first trimester ultrasound if a
discrepancy of ± 5-7 days exists per standard dating protocol (Corwin, 2017). Measures (questionnaire, clinical,
and biological data) were collected in person at the initial visit or by electronic medical record.
Demographic data
Socio-demographic variables included age, marital status, years of education, and insurance status. The
poverty/income ratio was determined from family size and household income data.
Clinical and Edinburgh Depression Scale Data
Health data extracted from EMR included height, weight, parity, past and current tobacco use, and alcohol or
drug use in the first trimester of pregnancy. Depression data was collected by trained research coordinators at 8-
14 weeks gestation. Depression was defined using the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS); a 10-item scale of
depressive symptoms experienced in the last seven days (Cox, 1987). The EDS is a reliable tool to predict
antenatal combined major or minor depression (ACOG) with psychometric properties of 64-87% sensitivity, 73-
96% specificity, and 73% positive predictive value (Kozinszky, 2015). Individual question scores were summed
and total scores ranged from 0-30 with higher scores associated with a higher risk of depression. Four cut-off
scores were explored (≥7, ≥8, ≥9, and the universal standard ≥10) to determine the optimal cutoff value to
detect depressive symptomatology in our AA study sample (Cox, 1987). Receiver operating characteristic
curves were constructed to visualize and compare the specificity of the cutoff scores. An optimal EDS cutoff of
≥10, area under the curve 0.6867, was determined to differentiate the groups of high versus low or no risk of
depression (Figure 1).
Serum PBDE Concentrations
Concentrations of PBDEs congeners 47, 85, 99, 100, 153, and 154 were measured in maternal serum using a
modification of a previous method (Darrow, 2017; Jacobson, 2016). Samples were fortified with isotopically
labeled analogues of the target chemicals, homogenized and deprotonated. Supernatants were extracted twice
with hexane and dichloromethane and passed through an activated silica gel column to remove residual
biogenic material. Sample extracts were concentrated and analyzed using gas chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry with isotope dilution calibration. The limits of detection (LODs) (see supplemental Table 1) were
in the low pg/mL range. Values below the LOD were replaced with a value equal to the LOD, divided by the

square root of two (Hornung and Reed, 1990). Maternal serum total cholesterol and free triglycerides were not
collected, therefore lipid adjustment was not done.
Covariates and Potential Confounders
In order to test the relationship between PBDE congeners and depression, covariates and/or potential
confounders were considered a priori and reassessed after bivariate analyses. The confounders identified a
priori were age, gravidity, marital status, education, BMI, and income based on associations noted in previous
literature (Faravelli, 2013; Feder, 2018; Bracke, 2014; Wiltink, 2013). Income had >20% missing values (n =
39) so insurance type was used as a proxy. Parity, indicating the number of pregnancies reaching viable
gestational age, was tested as a covariate. During bivariate analysis, education and parity were dropped because
no significant associations with the outcome of depression were observed.
Statistical Analysis
PBDE congeners were log transformed (base 10) to reduce the influence of outliers and to conform to
normality. For congeners with a 50% or greater presence (-47, -99, and -100), geometric means were used to
describe PBDE data and reduce the right skewed data distribution resulting from imputed data. Congeners -85
and -154 were not detected in any samples (above instrumental LOD) and were therefore not reported and
excluded from analysis. Congener -153 was detected in only 14% of the samples and was subsequently not used
in further analyses.
We examined univariate associations within demographic characteristics, PBDE concentrations, and EDS
scores. Geometric means were used to describe PBDE concentrations and to compare to 2013-2014 NHANES
data restricted to non-Hispanic black women aged 18-35 years. Wilcoxon nonparametric tests were used to
compare PBDE congeners between low and high depression groups. Parametric tests of association were
completed for covariates and depression variables. Spearman rank-order and Kruskal-Wallis tests were
conducted to compare means among skewed data. Bivariate analysis between PBDE 47 and depression groups
yielded unequal variances so Satterthwaite test statistic was reported. Missing data were explored within each
covariate and accounted for <10% of the sample and were not further manipulated.
Each PBDE congener was regressed with confounding variables in linear and logistic regression models to
investigate associations with depression. Exposure to a PBDE mixture (congeners -47, -99, and -100) was
evaluated using a weighted quantile sum (WQS) approach in conjunction with multiple linear and nonlinear
logistic regression (Carrico, 2014). The WQS method estimates a weighted linear index corresponding to
chosen quantiles of PBDEs. Bootstrap sampling is used to empirically determine the weights, constrained
between 0 and 1 and summed to 1. Since environmental exposures co-occur, interact, and are highly correlated,
the WQS method reduces dimensionality and addresses multicollinearity (Czarnota 2015). The WQS index was
placed in the best-fit model where exp(β1) is the odds ratio associated with a unit (quartile) increase in the
weighted quartile sum of PBDE exposures. The WQS index was regressed using an EDS cutoff ≥10. The
significance of the test represents a test for a mixture effect.
Statistical significance was set at 0.05 and all analyses were performed using SAS v9.4 and R v3.4.
RESULTS
Basic descriptive statistics for the total sample of 193 women are presented in Table 1. Of the total sample, 52
women (26.9%) were categorized as having a high risk of depression (EDS cutoff ≥10) and 141 (73.1%) had a
low or no risk of depression. In this sample, the alpha coefficient was 0.85. The majority of participants were

unmarried (86.5%), had at least some college education (48.2%), and qualified for Medicaid health insurance
(77.8%) (Table 1). Both high and low or no risk of depression groups had an approximately normal distribution
of educational attainment. Approximately half were overweight or obese (54.4%) and nulliparous (48.2%). A
small proportion reported consuming alcohol (4.2%) or marijuana (17.1%) in the last month, or ever smoked
tobacco (10.9%) (Table 2).
The women’s mean BMI scores were significantly different between the depression groups. Substance use in
the last month and ever used tobacco were also associated with having an EDS score of ≥10.
When comparing the 2014-2014 NHANES data reflecting the pooled samples of non-Hispanic Black women aged
20-39, our study population had similar levels of BDE -47 and -99 but lower levels of BDE -100 (Table 3).
Consistent with previous literature, PBDE congeners were significantly intercorrelated (r= 0.6-0.7, p<0.001),
limiting statistical methods. Although not strong, serum PBDE 47 concentrations and marijuana use were
positively associated (r=0.12, p=0.03). Neither tobacco nor alcohol use were associated with any congener.
Levels of BDE -47 and -99 were significantly different between low and high depression groups (p=0.04 and
p=0.02, respectively) (Table 4). As concentrations of PBDE -47 in the serum increase, the probability of having
depressive symptoms also increases (β =2.36, p=0.05) (Figure 2). However, this association accounted for only
6% of the variability.
All covariates and confounding variables identified a priori were entered into the multivariate model. The best-
fit model controlled for age, marital status, and BMI to test for associations between PBDEs and depression.
In the adjusted regression analysis, models were used to examine the associations between PBDEs (Table 5),
and depressive symptoms. Statistical significance was detected with BDEs -47 and 99, but not BDE -100. For
every one unit increase in concentration, the risk of being mild to moderately depressed increased by a factor of
4.52 for BDE-47, 1.58 for BDE-99, and 1.22 for BDE-100 adjusting for age, marital status, and BMI. No issues
of multicollinearity existed since all various inflation factors values were low (<2). The Hosmer-Lemeshow
goodness of fit (0.461-0.594) suggests good fit for each model.
In order to show which PBDE congener had the most robust association with depressive symptoms, a PBDE
WQS index was regressed with the dichotomous depression variable and presented in Table 6. The distribution
of weights comprising the index was led by BDE-47 (w= 0.71) followed by BDE-100 (w= 0.29), then BDE-99
(w= 0. 00000000817). The fitted coefficients exp(β) provided an estimated odds ratio for risk of depression
resulting from the PBDE mixture. Specifically, increases in the weighted PBDE index were significantly
associated with higher depressive symptoms after adjusting for age, marital status, and BMI (OR=2.93; CI 1.18,
7.82).

DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between concentrations of PBDEs in serum and
depressive symptoms in pregnant AA women, a vulnerable and traditionally understudied population in the
context of both PBDE exposure and prenatal mental health outcomes. The bulk of PBDE and health outcome
research has centered on maternal exposures and fetal development but, as concentrations continue to be detect
remote from the production phase-out, health concerns beyond early childhood should be explored. Cowell et
al. (2018) found no significant differences in PBDE cord blood concentrations collected before and after the

phase out supporting the persistent properties and ongoing release if the chemicals from products. Exposures
and their body burdens are not well-characterized in pregnant women versus nonpregnant. In our sample of 193
pregnant women, 100% had detectable concentrations of BDE -47. Body burden estimates are similar to serum
concentrations from the most recent 2013-2014 NHANES national sample of non-Hispanic black women of
reproductive ages. Findings indicate positive associations between PBDE congeners, the PBDE mixture, and
high depressive symptoms among our study population. The weighted PBDE index identified BDE -47 to be the
“bad actor” within the mixture. We anticipated this since it is highly prevalent across multiple matrixes (cite).
Due to the small amount of variability in the final regression models, further studies should focus on potential
covariates that could better explain the relationship between serum PBDE concentration and prevalence of
depressive symptoms. We understand humans are exposed to many environmental chemicals at once and the
preliminary findings in this study using the WQS method broadens our perspectives on analyzing highly
correlated variables and provides better estimates of the PBDE mixture effect. For more comprehensive mixture
estimates, additional endocrine disrupting chemicals should be considered. Theoretically, endocrine disruptors
have similar health effects and may be working through similar pathways (cite) to affect mood. Assessing for
exposure to other endocrine disruptors and neuropsychological outcomes in this population could provide
insight into shared metabolic pathways.
Consistent with previous studies of tobacco use and depression in pregnancy (Newport, 2012), tobacco use and
substance abuse correlated with EDS scores. However, our data collection protocol did not allow us to account
for the onset of depressive symptoms to further analyze the correlations. It is plausible that depressed or stressed
women are likely to smoke tobacco or use marijuana as a coping mechanism (Lobel, 2008; Weaver, 2008). It is
also plausible there is no causal relationship between substance use or smoking and depression, but rather the
behavior is an expression of one’s attitude or emotion (Rodell, 2009). Lazarus and Folkman (1987) described
stress as being physiologic and psychologic, both having the opportunity to lead to problematic health
outcomes. In the context of this study, we believe stressors lead to physiologic and psychologic depressive
responses without regard to co-occurring behaviors such as smoking or marijuana use.
Based on this study, there is a high risk of perinatal depression among African American (27%) compared to the
national average of all perinatal women regardless of race (8.5%). In our study of only AA women, those with
lower income, using insurance as a proxy, had disproportionate rates of depression (29%) compared to those
with higher income or private insurance (21%). This is consistent with other studies who have been reported
elevated perinatal major depression rates of 19-28% (Melville 2010; Hobfall, 1995; Grobman, 2016; Tandon,
2012) also in low income AA women.
Our outcome measure, EDS score, is a measure of depression risk, not a diagnostic measure. It is primarily
utilized by health professionals and researchers to objectively identify mothers suffering from stress that may be
interfering with normal activities or enjoyment of life. Clinically, the EDS cutoff used for referral or to warrant
repeat testing remains variable (Bunevicius, 2009; Tsai, 2013; Bergink, 2011). In light of this uncertainty, we
took a careful analytic approach to identify an appropriate value specific for our sample. Surprisingly, our
analysis demonstrates that using a standard cutoff of ≥10 is optimal for decision making in regards to
depression risk for urban AA pregnant women. Using a cutoff of ≥10 is likely to accurately predict depression
in most women but some suggest repeat testing as frequent as two weeks later regardless of the cutoff score
(Matthey, 2012), especially among populations where cultural variations may exist in the expression of
depressive symptoms (Smith-Nielson, 2018). Tandon et al. (2012) collected depression measures and performed
subsequent sensitivities on the EDS. Similar to this study, they recommended an optimal cutoff score for major
and minor depression of ≥10 in this population. In general, AAs are less likely to be diagnosed with depression
or treated for depressive symptoms compared to white patients (Gallo et al., 2005), and across subgroups,
African Americans are more likely to have persistent mental disorders after becoming ill (Breslau 2005). At a
minimum, providers should be alerted when EDS scores fall between 7-10 since patients could be developing

depression and a trustworthy rapport can positively impact patient compliance and follow-up (Zink 2017;
Gilbert 2009).
Limitations
There are notable limitations to this study. Since our study relied on maternal-self report to document tobacco
use, substance abuse, and depressive symptoms, it is possible that recall bias interfered with our results. The
study sample is based on convenience sampling from two metropolitan prenatal clinics. While it may represent
most AA pregnant women living in urban environments, attempts were not made to include hard-to-reach
groups. Especially during pregnancy, study participants may have been reluctant to disclose the presence or
absence of depressive symptoms or current use of tobacco or illegal drugs. Women report difficulty disclosing
perinatal mental illness because of stigmas of inadequacy as a mother or stigmas of treatment in pregnancy
(Moore, 2016). Others refuse to seek help because of poor mental health knowledge or literacy (Jorm, 2006).
Self-report of substance abuse is underrepresented resulting from maternal guilt or remorse (Stengel, 2014;
Stone, 2015). A cross-sectional study design comprised of one time point, limits the ability to cultivate causal
relationships. We attempted to compensate for this lack of temporality in part by excluding anyone with a
personal or family history of depression. Further longitudinal data is needed to substantiate the findings and
more confidently predict conclusions. Another limitation of our analytic approach was the lack of serum lipid
data which hindered our ability to lipid adjust serum PBDE concentrations. Variation of PBDE concentrations
in humans is common due to multiple exposure routes and elimination differences among each congener. A
final key limitation was the inability to determine the major sources of environmental exposures to PBDEs in
this population which impacts future development of preventive interventions for pregnant AA populations.
CONCLUSION
Health concerns related to PBDE exposure are becoming apparent and will likely continue for years due to slow
chemical degradation leading to persistence and accumulation in our environment. Products with PBDEs are
common and continue to be used in homes, schools, and businesses across the country. Even those removed
from homes continue to decompose in landfills and recycling centers releasing harmful toxicants into the air,
water, and soil. Our analysis revealed BDE-47, -99, and -100 are present in a cohort of pregnant AA women
and the weighted mixture is associated with high depressive symptoms. The novel associations were found in a
relatively small sample size and among a non-occupationally exposed group. The need for replication and
consistent results is suggested. Because of limited research and slow PBDE degradation, it is unclear whether
PBDE accumulation has other long-term implications on pregnant women. Additional studies are needed to
address population health impacts resulting from PBDE bioaccumulation since the chemicals are likely to be
present in the environment for many years ahead. The cross-sectional methodology of this study can be
particularly useful in informing researchers and public health professionals about depressive symptomatology
among AA pregnant women and changes in PBDE concentrations over time. Assessing environmental burdens
and human toxicant effects, especially mixtures, can inform planning and allocation of health resources for
mitigation and prevention. Endocrine disrupting chemicals such as PBDEs are completely modifiable and
prevention efforts should be given high priority.
