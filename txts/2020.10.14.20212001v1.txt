       Abstract: Biomarkers of progression to severe dengue are urgently required for effective patient
       management. Innate immune cells have been implicated in the enhancement of infection and
       “cytokine storm” associated with dengue severity. Using intracellular cytokine staining and flow
       cytometry, we observed significantly higher proportions of innate immune cells secreting
30     inflammatory cytokines dominated by IFN-γ and TNF-α at admission associated with good
       prognosis. Secondary dengue predisposed to severe outcomes. In patients with severe dengue and
       those with liver impairment, early activation as well as efficient down-regulation of innate
                                                                            1

       responses were compromised. IFN-γ+CD56+CD3+ NKT cells and IL-6+ granulocytes served as
       novel biomarkers of progression to severity (composite AUC=0.85-0.9). Strong correlations
       among multiple cytokine-secreting innate cell subsets pointed to coordinated activation of the
       entire innate immune system by DENV.
 5     Short Title: Innate cytokine biomarkers of dengue severity
       One Sentence Summary: Activation and efficient attenuation of innate immunity are both
       compromised in severe dengue.
       Main Text: Dengue virus (DENV) afflicts ~130 million people annually with 70% contribution
       from Asia (1). Majority of patients present with mild dengue fever (DF) while ~5-20% develop
10     severe dengue (SD)- characterized by plasma leakage leading to shock and/or organ impairment
       that predominantly manifest during defervescence (2, 3). The need to identify severe cases early,
       to facilitate interventions that reduce mortality has spawned numerous investigations to find
       biomarkers of severity. The phenomenon of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral
       infectivity has been implicated in dengue pathology (4, 5) with monocytes that both support virus
15     growth and express all three classes of Fc-receptors (FcγR, FcεR and FcαR) being major
       contributors (6, 7). Deficits in T cell signaling and cytokine secretion have been reported in dengue
       patients from Sri Lanka, India and Thailand (8, 9). Combined with spontaneous high production
       of multiple cytokines from unstimulated PBMCs (9), this implicated innate cells as likely sources
       of the ‘cytokine storm’ in SD (10), supported by in vitro assays of infected monocytes and natural
20     killer (NK) cells (11, 12). Conflicting patterns for serum levels of TNF-α, IP-10 and IFN-γ as a
       function of severity were reported (13-16), perhaps due to variation in sampling time following
       infection. The failure to exploit flow cytometry made it impossible to identify the source of
       cytokines measured by ELISA. Against this backdrop, we carried out a blinded study (fig. S1) to
                                                                          2

       query the secretion of cytokines by human innate immune cells in response to DENV using
       intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry (fig. S2 & S3).
                 Dengue infection, in contrast to fevers from other etiologies, caused a surge in secretion of
       inflammatory cytokines from a variety of innate cells (Fig. 1, A-F). TNF-α was by far the most
 5     abundant cytokine secreted by multiple cell subsets from a vast majority of patients while an
       impressive 95.5% of patients secreted IFN-γ from CD56+CD3+ NKT cells (table S1). We also
       observed significantly greater numbers of dual-functional IL-10+TNF-α+ granulocytes and IFN-
       γ+TNF-α+CD56+CD3+ NKT cells, in dengue patients than in febrile controls (fig. S4A, B).
       Polyfunctional CD56+CD3+ NKT cells among others, could indeed be visualized by t-Distributed
10     Stochastic Neighbor Embedding analysis (fig. S5). Thus, in addition to monocytes which support
       dengue replication (11), all other innate cell subsets were also activated by DENV. As reported
       previously (17), DENV infection significantly increased the numbers of CD14+ and CD14+CD16+
       monocytes and significantly reduced CD56+CD3+ NKT cell numbers compared to controls (table
       S2; fig. S6A, B). Some cell subsets progressively expanded with increase in disease severity (table
15     S3). CD14+CD16+ intermediate monocytes or CD19+ B cells were the highest per cell secretors of
       all cytokines (fig. S7, A-E; table S1). The median florescence intensity (MFI) was comparable
       across severity except for TNF-α+CD56+CD3+ NKT cells (fig. S7F, G).
                                                                          3

                 When assessed as a function of disease severity, a significantly greater proportion of TNF-
       α+ granulocytes were evident in DF relative to DFWS/SD (Fig. 2A), a trend also evident for dual
       secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 by this cell subset and IL-10 secretion by CD56+CD3+ NKT cells
       (Fig. 2B, C). When we used bleed-scores or liver enzyme levels as a surrogate of severity, those
 5     with no bleeding or normal liver enzyme levels carried a significantly greater proportion of innate
       cells secreting inflammatory cytokines compared to those with varying degrees of hemorrhage or
       abnormal liver enzyme levels (Fig. 2, D-F). As expected, the odds of severity were greater in
       patients with high liver enzymes (fig. S8A, B) and secondary dengue (fig. S8C, D). The latter
       predisposition was accompanied by a significantly lower proportion of TNF-α secreting
10     monocytes, granulocytes and CD19+ B cells (fig. S8, E-H) reinforcing the reported (4, 5)
       deleterious role of pre-existing immunity on dengue outcomes. In addition, age and gender also
       influenced cytokine secretion from monocyte subsets (fig. S8I, J). Despite variations within the
       cohort based on gender, age and primary/secondary dengue, the higher percentages of innate cell
       subsets secreting inflammatory cytokines, impressively correlated with better prognosis as
15     suggested by earlier blood transcriptome studies (18). In contrast, higher frequency of
       monofunctional IP-10+CD19+ B cells was associated with severity (fig. S9A, B).
       Total TNF-α+ percentages within all subsets displayed strong positive correlation with one another
       (r=0.63-0.77), while IFN-γ+ and IFN-γ+TNF-α+ within CD56+CD16+ NK or CD56+CD3+ NKT
       cells positively correlated with each other (table S4), demonstrating synchronized activation of all
20     innate cells by DENV. In our large cohort, non-structural (NS) protein 1 levels, a measure of viral
       load did not vary with disease duration (fig. S10A). Patients with highest NS1 levels displayed
       highest innate cell cytokine secretion (fig. S10, B-D) and also avoided severe outcomes (fig.
                                                                          5

                 In order to query the link if any, between kinetics of innate immune activation by DENV
       and disease severity, we compared innate cell cytokine secretion between different measures of
       severity at early (days 1-3), intermediate (days 4-6) and late (days 7-15) times of hospital
       presentation. Patients admitted 1-3 days post symptom onset (dpso) had impressively higher TNF-
 5     α (Fig. 3A) and IFN-γ (Fig. 3B, S11A) -secreting innate cells in those with normal compared to
       above-normal liver enzyme levels. Those admitted 4-6 dpso had a significantly greater proportion
       of IFN-γ+CD56+CD3+ NKT cells as well as TNF-α-secreting granulocytes, CD19+ B cells and
       CD56+CD3+ NKT cells in DF relative to DFWS/SD (Fig. 3, C-F). In contrast, patients with high
       liver enzymes failed to down-regulate secretion of TNF-α, IL-6 and IP-10 from different innate
10     cell subsets during the late stage (7-15 dpso) that was prominent in patients with normal levels
       (Fig. 3G, H & S11, B-D). Severe dengue was also characterized by a late surge of IP-10 (fig. S11,
       E-F). Dysregulated high levels of IFN-γ+CD56+CD3+ NKT cells and TNF-α+CD19+ B cells were
       also evident in DFWS/SD relative to DF patients during this late time window (fig. S11, G-H).
       Thus, robust early secretion of TNF-α and IFN-γ by innate cells during acute disease phase
15     combined with efficient attenuation of all innate cytokines during later stages of disease averted
       severity.

                 To identify potential biomarkers of progression to severity, we compared those who
       worsened after recruitment (as evidenced by a shift from DF/DFWS to DFWS/SD or death), with
       patients who readily recovered from DF and DFWS/SD. Both recovered DF and DFWS/SD
       patients carried a significantly greater proportion of IFN-γ+TNF-α+CD56+CD3+-, IFN-
 5     γ+CD56+CD3+- NKT cells and monofunctional IL-6+ granulocytes (Fig. 4, A-C) relative to
       worsened patients. To assess the biomarker performance of these cells, receiver operating
       characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed. IFN-γ+TNF-α+CD56+CD3+-, IFN-
       γ+CD56+CD3+ NKT and monofunctional IL-6+ granulocytes provided AUC of 0.77, 0.76 and 0.75
       respectively with 90% sensitivity and 60 to 66% specificity when DF was compared with the
10     worsened group (fig. S12, A-C). Combining IL-6+ granulocytes and IFN-γ+CD56+CD3+ NKT cells
       using binary logistic regression resulted in composite AUC of 0.85 (Fig. 4D; table S5) and revealed
       that every one percentage rise in IFN-γ+CD56+CD3+ NKT resulted in 3.12 fold lower odds of
       worsening (95% CI=1.1-9.2, P=0.035). In patients with elevated AST, this composite biomarker
       predicted the progression to severity with higher accuracy (AUC=0.9) and displayed 100%
15     sensitivity with 81.9% specificity (table S5).

                 This study, the first to query the cellular source of innate inflammatory cytokines in a large,
       blinded dengue cohort, conclusively demonstrated the beneficial role of early innate cell activation
       triggered by high viral antigen levels, in ensuring recovery from dengue. DENV activated all
       innate immune subsets resulting in mono and polyfunctional cytokine production that correlated
 5     with good outcome. The innate immune cytokine signature for each pathogen may be unique and
       rewarding to investigate.
       The observed persistence of innate cell-derived cytokines during late phase of disease pointed to
       dysregulated innate responses in SD (20). Severe COVID-19 patients also displayed sustained
       plasma levels of IP-10 and IL-6 (21); increased plasma IP-10 also correlated with liver impairment
10     in HIV/HBV patients (22). In light of the reported requirement of IP-10 for B cell activation (23),
       our finding of abnormal high IP-10 levels during late stages of disease is a likely contributor to the
       B cell mediated pathology attributed to severe dengue (24). A potential role for persistently
       elevated innate responses in provoking the reported inappropriate TCR signaling and T cell
       apoptosis in SD (8, 9) warrants further investigation. Thus, failure to achieve both robust activation
15     and prompt attenuation of innate immune cells was a hallmark of severe dengue.
       Our composite biomarker performed well despite limited number of patients with transitions to
       greater severity and inclusion of patients with varying disease duration. Potential enhancement of
       its performance by including additional hitherto unidentified cytokine secreting cells will enhance
       its utility in a clinical setting. Ease of processing and ready availability of flow cytometers in
20     diagnostic laboratories assures feasibility of host blood-based biomarker deployment whereas
       biomarkers reliant on expensive instruments and high-end technical skills, may have limited utility
       in resource constrained geographies (25, 26).

       CD56+CD16+ NK cells secreting TNF-α showed strong positive correlation with multiple subsets
       pointing to its central role in the coordinated innate immune activation by DENV. Our findings
       are in line with the 20 gene transcript signature that included anti-viral IFN-γ signaling pathway
       genes, being under-expressed in NK and NKT cells of SD patients (26). Weaker activation of early
 5     innate effector mechanisms was also reported in patients who later developed severe
       manifestations (27). The reported impaired innate immune activation in severe SARS-CoV-2
       patients (28), suggests that severe disease in multiple viral infections may be a shared consequence
       of defective modulation of kinetics of early host innate activation as well as its subsequent
       attenuation.

    Ethics statement
    This study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Institutional ethics
    committee approval to conduct the study was obtained from the four participating hospitals;
    Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI; BMCRI/PS/25/2018-19),
    Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS; KIMS/IEC/A1-2018), St. John’s Medical
    College (SJMC; IEC/1/473/2019), M S Ramaiah Medical College (RMCH; MSRMC/EC/19) and
    Indian Institute of Science (IISc; 10-14032018), Bengaluru, India.
    Study subjects and clinical data collection
    778 participants were enrolled for this blinded study between June 24 and November 29, 2019
    which represents the annual dengue season following onset of monsoon rains at the four hospitals
    listed above. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before sample collection
    and analysis. Blood samples were coded and labeled as follows: DEN/hospital abbreviation/19/###
    before being sent to IISc for flow cytometry analysis. Consecutive suspected adult dengue patients
    (≥ 18 years) who tested positive using a dengue specific NS1/IgM rapid dengue day 1 test kit (J
    Mitra and Co., India) were recruited. Those who tested negative were recruited as febrile controls
    (FC); volunteers with no illness for the past 3 months were enrolled as healthy controls (HC; fig.
    S1).
    Sample size analysis for a desired power of 80%, type I error tolerance of 0.05, and a hypothesized
    effect size of 0.75, required at least 29 dengue patients who would transition post admission, to a
    worse condition as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) categorization of dengue
    severity as follows: dengue fever (DF) was defined by headache, body ache, rash, nausea, or mild
    bleeding; dengue fever with warning signs (DFWS) included symptoms like persistent vomiting,
                                                                                                                                       2

    mucosal bleeding, pleural effusion, ascites, and hepatomegaly. Severe dengue (SD) included
    symptoms such as plasma leakage, ≥1000 IU/L of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) / aspartate
    aminotransferase (AST), severe bleeding which leads to shock, and/or organ impairment (3).
    However, when the dengue cases ceased to appear in the hospitals by end November 2019, we had
    obtained only 10 patients who transitioned to a worse category, primarily owing to the clinical
    interventions following admission. The study was also designed to collect longitudinal samples at
    days 3 and 7 post-admission; however, only 154 patients provided a second sample and a single
    patient donated three consecutive samples. Demographic characteristics (i.e., gender and age),
    clinical features (i.e., days post symptom onset, nausea, head ache, body ache, abdominal pain,
    rashes, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and bleeding manifestations) and routine hematological
    laboratory findings (i.e., complete blood cell count, serum albumin, liver enzymes, platelet count
    and hematocrit) were recorded. Patients were assigned bleed-scores (BS) as follows: no bleeding,
    0; petechiae, 1; epistaxis/gingival bleeding/menorrhagia, 2; gastrointestinal bleeding, 3;
    intracranial/intrapulmonary bleeding, 4. Plasma leakage in pleural and/or peritoneal cavities was
    confirmed using X-ray/ultrasound scans. HIV patients were not recruited. Data from samples of
    patients with co-infections (typhoid, sepsis, malaria, urinary tract infection, Hepatitis B) or those
    who were discharged against medical advice (DAMA) and samples with experimental errors
    (clotted blood samples, QC failure of flow cytometer, sample processing errors) were excluded
    from analysis.
    Serology
    Dengue virus (DENV) infection was confirmed using a commercial IgM, IgG and NS1 enzyme-
    linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Panbio, Australia) and results were interpreted according to
    manufacturer’s instructions. The kits were used to distinguish primary (IgM to IgG ratio >1.2)
                                                                                                                                       3

    from secondary (IgM to IgG ratio <1.2) infection. Primary dengue status was also assigned to those
    who tested positive for DENV specific NS1 (index value >1.1) but were negative for IgM and IgG.
    Ex vivo intracellular cytokine staining of innate immune cells in whole blood
    Blood samples collected in sodium citrate vacutainer tubes (BD Biosciences) were immediately
    processed, no later than 4 hours from collection. RBCs from 500µl blood were lysed using 4ml of
    1X ammonium chloride buffer (166mM ammonium chloride, 9.9mM potassium bicarbonate and
    0.126mM EDTA). The centrifuged cells were washed with 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
    and stained with Fixable Viability Stain 450 [BD, Cat#562247] for 10 minutes at room
    temperature, to exclude dead cells. This was followed by staining for appropriate surface markers
    (table S6) for 30 minutes at 4°C. The surface marker TLR2 was superior to HLA-DR owing to its
    stable expression during infection in contrast to the latter which is reported to be down-regulated
    in all manner of inflammatory conditions, and was therefore used to identify monocytes (30). Cells
    were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde [Sigma Aldrich, Cat#P6148], washed and permeabilized
    with 0.1% saponin. The permeabilized cells were stained with intracellular antibodies (monocyte
    panel - IL-6, IP-10, IL-10, TNF-; NK panel - IP-10, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-) for 30 minutes at 4°C
    (table S6). Cells were washed, resuspended in 1X PBS and data were acquired on a Beckman
    Coulter DxFlex flow cytometer.
    Analysis of flow cytometry data
    Gating strategy for NK, monocyte and granulocyte subsets is shown in fig. S2. Cytokine-secreting
    cells are represented as percentage of parent population. Control samples were stained with surface
    antibodies and lacked all four intracellular markers keeping in mind the paucity of blood volumes
    (fluorescence minus four; FMF). Fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls were compared with
    FMF controls in five random individuals to confirm absence of non-specific binding of the
                                                                                                                                       4

    intracellular cytokine-specific antibodies. FMF controls were used to set the positive gates for each
    cytokine (fig. S3). Positive cytokine production was based on the criteria given for each cytokine
    from each cell subset in tables S7 and S8. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version
    10.6.1). Polyfunctional cytokine secretion was assessed by Boolean gating. The analyzed data
    from FlowJo was submitted to the clinical statistician for unblinding of patient characteristics prior
    to statistical analysis.
    Optimized t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE; (31)) analysis to visualize the
    clusters within the NK/NKT cells was performed. All 32 patient samples with SD were included
    along with 32 each from DF and DFWS (WHO 2009 categorization) which were selected at
    random using the RAND function in Excel 2016. A subset of 10,000 events were selected from
    CD19- cells for each sample using DownSample plugin, followed by concatenation of all events.
    A total of 960,000 events and 7 markers (CD56, CD16, CD3, IP-10, IL-10, TNF-, and IFN-)
    were used to generate the t-SNE map. We used the KNN algorithm (random projection forest –
    ANNOY) and Barnes-Hut gradient algorithm implementation with the recommended parameters
    (iterations – 1000; learning rate (eta) – 67200) at perplexity = 50 in t-SNE plugin built within
    FlowJo.
    Statistical analysis
    All analyses were done using IBM SPSS statistics 23.0 and GraphPad prism version 8.
    Significance between two or multiple groups was tested using Mann–Whitney U test (two-tailed)
    and non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons,
    respectively. In patient cohort characteristics, normally distributed data were tested using one-way
    ANOVA. Chi square test of independence and Fisher’s exact test were used to evaluate the
    association of clinical parameters with WHO categorization of patients based on severity.

    Differences between proportions of primary and secondary infection across WHO categories were
    assessed using the Z test for proportions. Confidence intervals for odds ratio were determined
    using Baptista-Pike method. Spearman’s correlation (two-tailed) analysis was performed to assess
    the positive or negative correlation between various cytokine secreting cell subsets. Receiver
    operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess accuracy of proposed
    biomarker and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Wilson/Brown method.
    Multivariate binary logistic regression was performed to compare DF or DFWS/SD with worsened
    groups as the dependent variables. Independent variables for multivariate analysis were selected if
    they were significantly different in univariate analysis (two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test for non-
    parametric continuous data and Chi square test for categorical variables). Required assumptions
    such as dichotomous mutually exclusive dependent variable, two or more independent variables,
    linear relationship between each independent variable and odds ratio, absence of multicollinearity
    were all met. Even though three independent variables were significantly different two of them
    directly correlated with each other (IFN-γ+TNF-α+CD56+CD3+ NKT cells and total IFN-
    γ+CD56+CD3+ NKT cells). Hence we used a combination of monofunctional IL-6+ granulocytes
    with either total IFN-γ+CD56+CD3+ NKT cells or IFN-γ+TNF-α+CD56+CD3+ NKT cells to
    generate logistic regression models. The latter was not significant and was not used.
    Monofunctional IL-6+ granulocytes with total IFN-γ+CD56+CD3+ NKT cells regression model was
    a good fit confirmed by the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test. The estimated probabilities
    obtained from logistic regression model were used to plot composite ROC curves.

    Supplementary Text
    Cohort Characteristics
     Of the 596 subjects with laboratory confirmed dengue who were included in the final data
    analyses, the mean age was 30.4±10.79 (mean±SD, range 17- 69). 72% of enrolled patients were
    male and 28% were female (table S9). They were admitted to the hospital at a median of 4 days
    (range 1-15) post symptom onset. Dengue specific IgM and IgG ELISA distinguished 336 (56.4%)
    primary patients from 256 (42.9%) secondary dengue patients. 281 patients tested positive for
    dengue specific NS1 ELISA. In our cohort, 333 (55.8%) patients were classified as DF, 227
    (38.7%) as DFWS and 32 (5.4%) as SD. The clinical laboratory parameters that correlated with
    the diagnoses are listed in tables S10 and S11. The longitudinal samples collected were not used
    for data analysis/interpretation since the innate immune activation status in these samples reflected
    the effect of medical intervention rather than disease progression. We therefore used the day of
    presentation at hospital to query the alterations in immune status as a function of kinetics of disease
    progression. Post recruitment and hospitalization, 7 patients worsened sufficiently to transition
    from DF to DFWS and 1 from DFWS to SD while 2 died. Interestingly, 9 among 10 worsened
    patients were men.
    Cytokine signature of innate immune cells against DENV
    The most abundant cytokines were IFN-γ from CD56+ NK cell subsets/CD19+ B cells and TNF-α
    from all innate cell subsets. CD16+ non-classical monocytes, CD56+CD3+ NKT cells, and
    CD14+CD16+ intermediate monocytes were the highest secretors of TNF-α. IFN-γ+TNF-α+ dual
    secreting cells were dominant in CD56+CD3+ NKT, CD19+ B cells, CD56+CD16+ and
    CD56+CD16- NK cell subsets (fig. S12, A-D). CD56+CD3+ NKT cells also had abundant dual-
    functional IL-10+TNF-α+ cells followed by IP-10+TNF-α+ cells (fig. S12A). CD56+CD16+ NK
    cells carried polyfunctional profile dominated by IP-10 in combination with IFN-γ or TNF-α (fig.
                                                                                                                                       7

    S12B). CD19+ B cells also showed the presence of IL-10+TNF-α+ dual functional cells followed
    by IP-10+TNF-α+ and IP-10+IFN-γ+. The triple positive cells from this subset included IFN-γ and
    TNF-α in combination with IL-10 or IP-10 (fig. S12C). Granulocytes and monocyte subsets had
    abundant IL-10+TNF-α+ cells (fig. S12, E-H). Granulocytes were the predominant secretor of
    multiple cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IP-10 and TNF-α; table S1) in addition to multiple combinations
    of polyfunctional cells (fig S12H). IL-6 and IL-10 were the least abundant cytokines secreted by
    all queried innate cell types against DENV.

    DFWS/SD severity groups as well as between time window of hospital presentation during 1-3, 4-
    6 or 7-15 days post symptom onset (dpso). P values were determined using Mann-Whitney U test
    between normal and abnormal levels of AST or DF and DFWS/SD groups for any single time
    interval and Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison of
    normal or abnormal AST / DF or DFWS/SD patients between the three time intervals. Medians
    with IQR are reported.

STARD 2015
AIM
STARD stands for “Standards for Reporting Diagnostic accuracy studies”. This list of items was developed to contribute to the
completeness and transparency of reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies. Authors can use the list to write informative
study reports. Editors and peer-reviewers can use it to evaluate whether the information has been included in manuscripts
submitted for publication.
EXPLANATION
A diagnostic accuracy study evaluates the ability of one or more medical tests to correctly classify study participants as having
a target condition. This can be a disease, a disease stage, response or benefit from therapy, or an event or condition in the
future. A medical test can be an imaging procedure, a laboratory test, elements from history and physical examination, a
combination of these, or any other method for collecting information about the current health status of a patient.
The test whose accuracy is evaluated is called index test. A study can evaluate the accuracy of one or more index tests.
Evaluating the ability of a medical test to correctly classify patients is typically done by comparing the distribution of the index
test results with those of the reference standard. The reference standard is the best available method for establishing the
presence or absence of the target condition. An accuracy study can rely on one or more reference standards.
If test results are categorized as either positive or negative, the cross tabulation of the index test results against those of the
reference standard can be used to estimate the sensitivity of the index test (the proportion of participants with the target
condition who have a positive index test), and its specificity (the proportion without the target condition who have a negative
index test). From this cross tabulation (sometimes referred to as the contingency or “2x2” table), several other accuracy
statistics can be estimated, such as the positive and negative predictive values of the test. Confidence intervals around
estimates of accuracy can then be calculated to quantify the statistical precision of the measurements.
If the index test results can take more than two values, categorization of test results as positive or negative requires a test
positivity cut-off. When multiple such cut-offs can be defined, authors can report a receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve which graphically represents the combination of sensitivity and specificity for each possible test positivity cut-off. The
area under the ROC curve informs in a single numerical value about the overall diagnostic accuracy of the index test.
The intended use of a medical test can be diagnosis, screening, staging, monitoring, surveillance, prediction or prognosis. The
clinical role of a test explains its position relative to existing tests in the clinical pathway. A replacement test, for example,
replaces an existing test. A triage test is used before an existing test; an add-on test is used after an existing test.
Besides diagnostic accuracy, several other outcomes and statistics may be relevant in the evaluation of medical tests. Medical
tests can also be used to classify patients for purposes other than diagnosis, such as staging or prognosis. The STARD list was
not explicitly developed for these other outcomes, statistics, and study types, although most STARD items would still apply.
DEVELOPMENT
This STARD list was released in 2015. The 30 items were identified by an international expert group of methodologists,
researchers, and editors. The guiding principle in the development of STARD was to select items that, when reported, would
help readers to judge the potential for bias in the study, to appraise the applicability of the study findings and the validity of
conclusions and recommendations. The list represents an update of the first version, which was published in 2003.
