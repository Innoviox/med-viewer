                                                           (Dated: October 15, 2020)
                    The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 1,000,000 reported deaths globally, of which
                more than 200,000 have been reported in the United States as of October 1, 2020. Public health
                interventions have had significant impacts in reducing transmission and in averting even more deaths.
                Nonetheless, in many jurisdictions the decline of cases and fatalities after apparent epidemic peaks
                has not been rapid. Instead, the asymmetric decline in cases appears, in most cases, to be consistent
                with plateau- or shoulder-like phenomena – a qualitative observation reinforced by a symmetry
                analysis of US state-level fatality data. Here we explore a model of fatality-driven awareness in which
                individual protective measures increase with death rates. In this model, fast increases to the peak are
                often followed by plateaus, shoulders, and lag-driven oscillations. The asymmetric shape of model-
                predicted incidence and fatality curves are consistent with observations from many jurisdictions. Yet,
                in contrast to model predictions, we find that population-level mobility metrics usually increased
                from low early-outbreak levels before peak levels of fatalities. We show that incorporating fatigue and
                long-term behavior change can reconcile the apparent premature relaxation of mobility reductions
                and help understand when post-peak dynamics are likely to lead to a resurgence of cases.

FIG. 1: Plateaus and shoulder-like dynamics in COVID-19 fatalities. (A) Examples of daily number of reported deaths for
COVID-19 (black points and lines) and the corresponding locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) curves (red lines)
in four states, including two estimated to be the most plateau-like (Minnesota and North Carolina) and two estimated to be
the most peak-like (Indiana and Maryland). Daily number of deaths is smoothed in log space, only including days with one or
more reported deaths. We restrict our analysis to states in which the peak smoothed death is greater than 10 as of June 7, 2020
(resulting in 17 states in total). (B) Smoothed daily number of reported deaths centered around the first peak time tP across
17 states. Smoothed death curves are plotted between tP − ∆t and tP + ∆t, where ∆t is defined such that smoothed death
at time tP − ∆t corresponds to 10% of the smoothed peak value. (C) Measured symmetry coefficient and confidence intervals.
Symmetry coefficient is calculated by dividing the death value at time tP − ∆t by the death value at time tP + ∆t. If the death
curve is symmetric, the symmetry coefficient should equal 1. Confidence intervals are calculated by bootstrapping across the
date of deaths for each individual 1000 times and recalculating the symmetry coefficient (after smoothing each bootstrap time
series). LOESS smoothing is performed by using the loess function in R.

FIG. S2: Dynamics given variation in the critical fatality awareness level, δc for awareness k = 1 (top) and k = 4 (bottom).
Panels show deaths/day (top) and the susceptible fraction as a function of time (bottom), the latter compared to a herd
immunity level when only a fraction 1/R0 remain susecptible. These simulations share the epidemiological parameters β = 0.5
/day, µ = 1/2 /day, γ = 1/6 /day, and fD = 0.01.
