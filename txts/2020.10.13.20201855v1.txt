    ABSTRACT
        Introduction. The Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR (4CE) includes
    hundreds of hospitals internationally using a federated computational approach to COVID-19
    research using the EHR.
        Objective. We sought to develop and validate a standard definition of COVID-19 severity from
    readily accessible EHR data across the Consortium.
        Methods. We developed an EHR-based severity algorithm and validated it on patient
    hospitalization data from 12 4CE clinical sites against the outcomes of ICU admission and/or
    death. We also used a machine learning approach to compare selected predictors of severity to
    the 4CE algorithm at one site.
        Results. The 4CE severity algorithm performed with pooled sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity
    0.83 for the combined outcome of ICU admission and/or death. The sensitivity of single code
    categories for acuity were unacceptably inaccurate - varying by up to 0.65 across sites. A
    multivariate machine learning approach identified codes resulting in mean AUC 0.956 (95% CI:
    0.952, 0.959) compared to 0.903 (95% CI: 0.886, 0.921) using expert-derived codes. Billing codes
    were poor proxies of ICU admission, with 49% precision and recall compared against chart review
    at one partner institution.
        Discussion. We developed a proxy measure of severity that proved resilient to coding variability
    internationally by using a set of 6 code classes. In contrast, machine-learning approaches may
    tend to overfit hospital-specific orders. Manual chart review revealed discrepancies even in the
    gold standard outcomes, possibly due to pandemic conditions.
        Conclusion. We developed an EHR-based algorithm for COVID-19 severity and validated it at
    12 international sites.

    BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE

        The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has stretched healthcare systems around

    the world to capacity. The need for actionable and reliable data has highlighted the value of the

    Electronic Health Record (EHR). In particular, practice patterns and patient outcomes recorded

    in the EHR can be rapidly aggregated and analyzed to promote learning and discovery and clinical

    feedback. [1] Large international investments to build such research networks [2–4] have been a

    largely unrealized vision [5]; COVID-19 has challenged our informatics infrastructures and

    highlighted continued challenges and weaknesses.

        The Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR (4CE) is a recently-

    convened volunteer consortium of over 300 worldwide sites who are leveraging EHR and clinical

    expertise to develop robust informatics-driven investigations into COVID-19. The approach relies

    on shared analytics scripts supporting two common research analytics formats where analysis is

    local, and aggregation is central. [6,7] By leveraging the investment in standard analytic models

    while respecting the issue of governance, we completed the initial phase of the study within two

    months of the COVID-19 outbreak, wherein we characterized COVID-19 comorbidities and

    laboratory test values at 96 international hospitals. [8]

        To understand patient disease courses and investigate outcomes using EHR data, it is critical

    to have a reliable and robust measure of disease severity. Intuitively, outcomes such as ICU

    admission and death would be good correlates of severity. Early work in 4CE attempted to use

    these outcomes as severity measures, but it became apparent that these data are not reliably

    available in all environments. Therefore, 4CE sought to develop a reasonable proxy measure of

    worse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 based on widely available EHR data

    (e.g., medication codes, diagnosis codes, and labs). This algorithm is essentially a computable

    phenotype, which is commonly used in medical informatics to detect the presence of a disease

    state through proxy measures, when no single validated data element for a disease exists.

    Computable phenotypes are very common [9–11] because reliable mentions of diseases are rare

    in the clinical record, and individual diagnosis codes are mediocre predictors of the actual

    presence of a disease. [12]

        Computable phenotypes are often defined using clinical and informatics expertise, wherein

    terms are specified that correlate per clinical experience with the phenotype. However, a

    phenotype can make sense clinically yet have poor performance due to coding anomalies and

    variation between sites. It is alternately possible to define phenotypes using a data-driven

    approach that uses statistical algorithms to find predictors of the desired outcomes directly from

    the data. These can also exhibit generalization problems due to overfitting. Thus, an important

    next step for either approach is to validate the phenotype, which can be done by comparing the

    concordance between the derived phenotype and the desired outcome - for which it is a proxy -

    at multiple sites. Although a variety of methods for defining an outcome are possible, the most

    reliable method of validating a computable phenotype is to perform chart review, which is

    considered the best available source of truth about the patient. [13,14] For example, identification

    of ICU admissions might not always be accurate, especially in a pandemic situation like COVID-

    19, where formal protocols were not followed. In hospitals where hallways were converted into

    ad-hoc ICUs to support the surge of sick patients, standardized EHR data elements such as

    ‘transfer to ICU’ would not be properly recorded. Manual note review (and perhaps NLP in the

    near future) would be the only method to discover a patient’s ICU status.



    Existing Severity Measures

        There has been heightened interest in disease severity measures since the outbreak of COVID-

    19. [15] We performed a review of 26 early COVID-19 studies. Five used ICU admission as the

    severity measure, one used American Thoracic Society criteria for severity of community-acquired

    pneumonia [16], and all the rest used the World Health Organization definition [17]. Other severity

    measures have been suggested [18]; however, they are not widely used or well validated.

        The WHO broadly defines “severe” disease as fever or suspected respiratory infection, plus

    one of the following: respiratory rate >30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or arterial


    oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximeter (SpO2) ≤93% while breathing room air. [17] The


    WHO definition includes patients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia who can be managed

    on medical wards and are not critically ill. Best evidence suggests that about 85% of such patients

    will never progress to critical illness such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). [19]

        ICU admission is not a useful severity measure for 4CE because these data have limited

    availability in EHRs. 4CE is only collecting common EHR data classes (demographics, diagnoses,

    medications, labs, and ICD procedure codes) and thus a severity measure must include only

    these. The WHO definition has the same issue and is also very inclusive. It is most strongly a

    proxy for hospital admission (moderate disease) rather than a difficult hospital course (severe

    disease). As such, it is a too sensitive marker for 4CE’s goal of identifying severe patients.



    Objective

        We set out to develop an EHR-driven severity algorithm as a proxy for worse clinical course in

    hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and validate this computable phenotype algorithm against

    the outcomes of ICU admission and/or death. Because outcome data had uncertain accuracy, we

    performed a limited chart review to better understand validation performance. Finally, we

    compared a data-driven algorithm at one site to the expert-derived 4CE algorithm.

    MATERIALS AND METHODS


    Defining Severity

        First, we developed a 4CE severity algorithm that is both clinically reasonable and possible to

    identify at our diverse sites. To do this, we needed to limit severity to the EHR data classes that

    4CE is collecting: demographics, diagnoses, medications, labs, and ICD procedure codes. We

    did not use outcomes (e.g., ICU admission), symptoms (e.g., wheezing), or vital signs (e.g.,

    respiratory rate), as these are not widely or reliably available in electronic health records.

        We used the WHO severity definition as a starting point and two authors (GW and GB) identified

    a much more specific diagnosis group: patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation for

    acute respiratory failure or vasoactive medication infusions for shock.

        We created a value-set of EHR data elements that suggest these disease states, based on

    commonly available data classes:

          ●    Lab Test: PaCO2 or PaO2

          ●    Medication: sedatives/anesthetics or treatment for shock

          ●    Diagnosis: ARDS, ventilator-associated pneumonia

          ●    Procedure: endotracheal tube insertion or invasive mechanical ventilation [20]

        These data elements correlate with many individual standard codes. To identify standard

    codes, we cross-referenced the i2b2 ontology in the ACT network. [2] This is a comprehensive

    terminology dictionary of 2.5 million codes found in many EHRs, arranged hierarchically so that

    individual codes are arranged in folders describing the above concepts. The result was a list of

    ~100 codes in the International Classification of Diseases versions 9 and 10 (ICD-9 and ICD-10),

    Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC), and RxNorm format, which are

    international standards used for research. These are listed in Table A1 in the Appendix.

        Local sites expanded these standard codes to match their local codes. Often, this was assisted

    with previous mappings from i2b2 where local items were a child folder of the standard code. [21]

    When mappings were not straightforward, the terms that most closely matched the definition were

    used, maximizing semantic equivalence across sites. For example, some US sites had both CPT

    and ICD procedure codes; the CPT codes were not added when ICD was available. In contrast,

    because some European sites do not use ICD-10-CM, other coding systems (like OPS codes)

    were added to identify invasive mechanical ventilation.

        Each participating site defined a “4CE Cohort” as any hospitalized patient who had any positive

    test for SARS-CoV-2 +14/-7 days around the hospitalization. A patient was considered severe if

    codes generated during the hospital course matched any code in the value set.



    Network-Wide Analysis: 4CE Severity Validation

        To validate the 4CE severity algorithm, a subset of sites identified patients who were admitted

    to the ICU and/or who died. Although these outcomes were not a perfect equivalence to severe

    disease or hospital course, they are objective measures that can be gleaned from patient data.

    We defined three options for confirming ICU admission, in order from most to least accurate:

          1) Chart Review. This is considered the gold-standard for identifying outcomes like ICU

               admission and could have been particularly useful in crisis situations like the COVID-19

               pandemic. Nonetheless, chart review is time-consuming and laborious, so this option was

               impractical at institutions without substantial human resources.

          2) Local Hospital Data. Hospital systems have idiosyncratic methods of determining ICU

               status, but they tend to be fairly accurate because they are used to determine admission,

               discharge, and transfer (ADT) status and to manage hospital bed allocation. However, not

               all sites had access to local hospital data, and expertise was required to incorporate this

               information into a data warehouse. Such limitations underscored the rationale for

               development of the severity proxy.

          3) Specific ICU CPT Procedure Codes. In the US, healthcare providers and hospitals use

               current procedural terminology (CPT) codes to bill for provided critical care services. CPT

               codes for billing time spent providing critical care (99291, 99292) provide a third option for

               defining ICU admission. These CPT codes were not used to define the severity proxy

               measure.

    Each site computed a set of 2x2 tables comparing the 4CE severity algorithm to three outcomes

    (death only, ICU only, and ICU-or-death) (Table A2). Sites calculated sensitivity, specificity,

    positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and F1-score from these tables.

    We used a fixed-effects meta-analysis model to estimate pooled scores over all sites. Sites then

    calculated the performance of individual code classes by computing the sensitivity for the same

    set of three outcomes. This analysis gave further insight into the components of the algorithm’s

    performance at each site. Sensitivity would be highest for the full algorithm, as it is a combination

    of all 4CE severity code classes. Additionally, each site reported its approach for confirming ICU

    admission, total number of ICU beds (to give a sense of site capacity), and any variation from the

    standard 4CE severity definition or cohort definition. Sites performed these analyses between

    August 5, 2020 and September 18, 2020, reflecting cases that were recorded from March through

    August 2020.

        To understand the practical differences between methods of defining ICU admission, we

    performed a limited analysis at two sites. We used a set of chart-reviewed ICU admission data

    among 866 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) between

    March 8, 2020 and June 3, 2020. Extensive manual chart reviews were completed by trained

    reviewers, including physicians, pharmacists, research nurses, and clinical research coordinators.

    [22] University of Freiburg Medical Center in Germany (UKFR) provided a set of ICU admission

    flags obtained from manual chart review of 168 patients in their 4CE COVID-19 cohort. They

    identified ICU stays directly related to their COVID-19 infection. We compared coded ICU

    admissions to the chart-reviewed data at MGH and UKFR for patients in the 4CE COVID-19

    cohort. These overlapping data sets allowed us to compare the two definitions of ICU admission

    with the 4CE severity algorithm. We also compared the performance of the chart-reviewed

    definition to CPT code-based ICU admission (99291 and 99292) using MGH data.



    Data-Driven Pilot Analysis

        We undertook a machine-learning approach at a single site, Mass General Brigham, using an

    existing computable phenotyping pipeline.

        First, we evaluated the classification performance of the 4CE severity algorithm. Second, we

    performed automated computable phenotyping using the Minimize Sparsity Maximize Relevance

    dimensionality reduction algorithm to select codes from among all possible data elements. [23,24]

    In both approaches, we applied generalized linear models (GLM) with a logit link, binomial

    distribution, and component-wise functional gradient boosting [25,26] to develop the

    computational models. We used the 4CE COVID-19 cohort with ICU admission and/or death as

    the target for prediction. We trained and tested the models using an 80-20 train-test split, which

    we iterated 9 times to capture potential variability in performance metrics due to sampling. Model

    tuning was performed via 5-fold cross-validation. To evaluate the two computable phenotyping

    models, we calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) on

    the held-out test sets.

    RESULTS


    4CE Severity Analysis

        Twelve sites participated in this analysis. The site names, locations, number of hospital beds,

    number of ICU beds (not reflecting surge capacity), and total 4CE cohort size (rounded to the

    nearest 10) are shown in Table 1. We also included the data source used for ICU admission and

    whether the site’s code mapping included any significant additions to the severity value set. (For

    example, European sites do not use the US Clinical Modifications of ICD-10, so additional

    standard codes were needed.) In further results, site names were replaced by a randomly-

    assigned region identifier (either USAx for sites in the United States or GLOBALx for others).

    Table 1: Participating 4CE sites and metadata on ICU and 4CE coding definitions, number of
    beds, and 4CE cohort size (rounded to the nearest 10).


        Sites reported the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the 4CE severity algorithm for the

    outcome of ICU admission and/or death. The pooled F-score over 12 sites was estimated as 0.72

    (95% CI: 0.63,0.80) using a fixed-effect meta-analysis model. The pooled sensitivity was 0.73

    (95% CI: 0.64,0.82) with mean 0.73 (range 0.56). The pooled specificity was 0.83 (95% CI:

    0.76,0.91) with mean 0.80 (range 0.5). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and F-score by site

    can be seen in Table 2. Sites also computed these measures separately for ICU admission and

    death. The pooled specificity went down for the individual outcomes (0.79 for ICU and 0.67 for

    death), but sensitivity was higher (0.77 for ICU, 0.76 for death). The statistics for the individual

    outcomes can be seen in Table A3 in the Appendix.

    Table 2. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and F1-score of the 4CE severity algorithm for the
    outcome ICU admission and/or death, at each site in the United States (USA) and outside the US
    (GLObal). Estimates of the pooled scores were computed using a fixed-effect meta-analysis
    model.


        Sites computed the sensitivity of individual code classes to understand how each contributed

    to the performance of the overall metric. Code classes demonstrated high variability of sensitivity

    across sites (Figure 1). For example, the anesthetic medication class had sensitivity ranging from

    0.02 to 0.67. Code class sensitivity for the separate outcomes of ICU admission and death can

    be seen in Figures A1-A3 in the Appendix. Figure 2 shows the percentage of all severe patients

    with a code in each class with the outcome of ICU admission and/or death. Figure 3 shows the

    overlap of high-level code classes in a Venn Diagram.

    Comparison of ICU Definitions

        We computed the precision and recall of code-defined ICU admission using chart review as the

    reference at MGH and UKFR. At MGH, we found agreement for ICU admission with 97% precision

    and 83% recall. At UKFR, we measured 78% precision and 85% recall. At MGH, we also

    compared agreement of CPT-code ICU admission definition to chart-reviewed ICU admission and

    found a 49% precision and 49% recall.

        We also recomputed summary statistics of the performance of our 4CE severity algorithm for

    the outcome of ICU admission and/or death using the chart-reviewed definition of ICU. At MGH

    and UKFR, the sensitivity was higher using the chart-reviewed definition (MGH: 0.80 vs 0.58 using

    hospital codes; UKFR: 0.85 vs. 0.74 using hospital codes). Specificity went down at MGH (0.75

    vs 0.86 using hospital codes), while it went up slightly at UKFR (0.96 vs 0.93 using hospital

    codes).

        The differences between UKFR and MGH (lower agreement precision at UKFR, higher

    specificity performance of severity) are likely due to UKFR identifying only COVID-related ICU

    admissions, while MGH identified all ICU admissions during the COVID-19 hospitalization.

        The full sets of summary statistics are reported in Tables 3 and A4.

        The GLM model trained using the 4CE severity codes performed with a mean AUC ROC 0.903

    (0.886, 0.921) on the MGB COVID-19 cohort of 4227 patients. The GLM model trained on MSMR-

    DISCUSSION

        When using EHR-derived data for research, we often adopt proxies for outcomes, especially if

    these outcomes are infrequently or poorly recorded in the EHR. Validation of these proxies is

    essential so that we can understand their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, if research is to

    be performed on a network and especially global scale, the outcome proxies must use data types

    broadly available through most EHRs and also be validated at multiple sites to account for the

    differences of coding patterns that occur. Examining subgroup performance of the codes can

    further improve our ability to understand cross-site differences.

        In this study, our primary aim was to develop and validate an EHR-based severity algorithm for

    the 4CE network to enable network-wide research on COVID-19 across numerous heterogeneous

    sites. The EHR proxies we used to test for severity included commonly available elements in the

    EHR: diagnosis codes, laboratory orders, medication orders, and procedure codes. These

    elements improve our ability to infer the presence of respiratory distress and shock, which

    presumably are serious enough to lead to ICU admission, if available, and/or death.

        This study highlights the frequent presence of coding differences between sites, as

    demonstrated by the remarkable variation of sensitivity by code class. Moreover, the codes

    captured for the severity algorithm at each site are very different. For example, some sites had a

    very high prevalence of mechanical ventilation codes and blood gas orders, whereas others had

    a low prevalence of these same measures, likely due to practice variation and code extraction

    differences. We compensated for this limitation by employing a method that accounts for this

    issue and highlights the importance of expert-derived proxies for accurate EHR-based analysis.

    Clinicians who understood the vagaries of hospital coding helped several sites to improve their

    data extraction and analysis, thereby contributing to the data quality of the 4CE initiative.

        Given that the codes were a proxy for the severity of illness, the PPVs we obtained in the range

    of 0.7 to 0.9 and the NPVs in the range of 0.68 to 0.98 are indicative of the model’s overall

    success. At three sites, the 4CE severity algorithm was more sensitive than specific. Patient

    mortality or ICU transfer was captured by the algorithm, but it also captured patients without those

    outcomes. At most sites (9/12), the algorithm had higher specificity than sensitivity; it flagged

    mostly ICU or deceased patients but missed patients as well.

        This study also highlights the challenges in selecting a gold standard for validation. There is no

    measurable assessment of a patient’s actual complexity, so we chose ICU admission or mortality

    as they are commonly measured gold standards. However, ICU admission is not always clearly

    defined, especially during the pandemic. We evaluated 3 ways of identifying ICU admission, with

    accuracy improving from CPT codes to hospital code ICU designation to chart review by clinical

    experts. Our separate analysis of ICU admission definition suggests that the particular approach

    to coding ICU admission could impact measured performance. It also validated our prioritization

    of choices for defining ICU admission: chart review was preferred, followed by hospital codes,

    and then billing data. The gold standard for validation is chart review, and the differences between

    what is actually recorded in a patient’s chart and what data elements are available in the EHR are

    not always appreciated. In our analysis, chart review as compared to hospital data had precision

    of 97% (MGH) / 78% (UKFR) and recall of 83% (MGH) / 85% (UKFR), due largely to ICU

    admissions missed in hospital codes. This is probably due to the pandemic situation of COVID-

    19, where non-traditional spaces were converted into ICUs to support the surge of sick patients.

    The 4CE Severity algorithm performed overall better when using the chart review-based ICU

    admission numbers and was able to correctly identify many more severe patients. Sensitivity

    increased by 0.22 at MGH and 0.11 at UKFR. Change in specificity was mixed, but this was likely

    influenced by the different ICU admission targets at the two sites (all ICU admissions at MGH vs.

    COVID-related ICU admissions at UKFR). Billing codes were significantly less precise, missing

    many ICU admissions, yielding 49% precision and 49% recall. In the next phase of our work, it

    will be important to validate our findings with the addition of clinical notes at additional sites.

        We explored a machine-learning data-driven approach at a single site and compared the results

    to our expert-derived algorithm. Among the top ten features identified by the data-driven model,

    four were conceptually similar to the expert-derived algorithm. Three were labs that occurred more

    frequently in the ICU than on the floor, which are reflective of biases in ordering patterns more

    than clinically meaningful data points. [27] The remaining orders were interesting proxies of the

    ICU (e.g., chlorhexidine, an antibacterial agent used for cleaning the skin). These proxies may be

    less generalizable than expert-curated codes.



    Limitations

        Our data-driven computable exploration was only performed at one site. In the future, we hope

    to engage a larger sample of sites in a data-driven analysis, which would allow us to pool together

    a list of common codes to better discern generalizability. This will become possible as the 4CE

    network expands its computational infrastructure.

        Additionally, all participating hospitals were in countries that experienced a surge in the COVID-

    19 pandemic, which could create unanticipated bias in the results.



    Conclusion

        We developed an EHR-based severity algorithm that can be used when longer-term outcomes

    data are not readily or reliably available. We validated this at 12 international 4CE sites and

    confirmed its good performance, due largely to its inclusiveness and breadth. We discovered

    many coding differences in individual EHR elements across sites. Additionally, we explored the

    comparison of an expert-derived proxy to a data-driven acuity score that maximized performance

    captured information that was not reliable in hospital administrative data.
