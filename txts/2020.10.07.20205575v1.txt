    ABSTRACT
    Background: As the number of new cases and death due to COVID-19 is increasing,
    understanding the characteristics of severe COVID-19 patients and identifying characteristics
    that lead to death is a key to make an informed decision. In Ethiopia, as of September 27, 2020, a
    total of 72,700 cases and 1165 deaths were reported.
    Objective: The study aimed to assess the determinants of death in Severe COVID-19 patients
    admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.
    Methods: A case-control study of 147 Severe COVID-19 patients (49 deaths and 98 discharged
    alive cases) was conducted from August to September 2020. A comparison of underlying
    characteristics between cases (death) and controls (alive) was assessed using a chi-square test
    and an independent t-test with a p-value of <0.05 considered as having a statistically significant
    difference. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess a statistically significant
    association between the predictor variables and outcome of Severe COVID-19 (Alive Vs Death)
    where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR, and P-values were used for testing
    significance and interpretation of results.
                                                                                                                                               1

    Results: Having diabetes mellitus (AOR= 3.257, 95% CI= 1.348, 7.867, p-value=0.00), fever
    (AOR=0.328, 95% CI: 0.123, 0.878, p-value= 0.027) and Shortness of breath (AOR= 4.034,
    95% CI= 1.481, 10.988, p-value=0.006) were found to be significant predictors of death in
    Severe COVID-19 patients.
    Conclusions: The outcome of death in Severe COVID-19 patients is found to be associated with
    exposures to being diabetic and having SOB at admission. On the other hand, having a fever at
    admission was associated with a favorable outcome of being discharged alive.

    INTRODUCTION
    The 2019 corona virus pandemic has caused significant mortality all over the world, with a total
    death of 991,000 globally, 25,481 in Africa, and 1165 in Ethiopia as of September 27, 2020.
    Though it is reported that the African region showed a decreasing trend in the number deaths
    over the past several weeks compared to other WHO regions, according to the national report the
    number of deaths in Ethiopia seems considerable over the past weeks, with 10 to 20 death per
    day, compared to the trend at the beginning of the pandemic in the country 1,2.
    Studies conducted till today, in a non-African setup, show that the outcome of COVID-19 varies
    based on individual characteristics and it could include uneventful recovery, respiratory
    complications requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, renal abnormality requiring kidney
    replacement therapy, hyper-coagulable state, and death3-5.
    Studies also identified different risk factors as potential factors for mortality in COVID-19
    patients including older age, race, obesity, presence of pre-existing comorbidities, fracture,
    complications like acute organ failure, lack of early improvement in arterial partial pressure of
    oxygen (PaO2) to a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio 4,6-13.
    The role of sex in the severity of the disease or outcome is not clear yet but one study reported no
    difference in epidemiological characteristics with regard to sex, and in another study, it was
    reported that sex might have an impact in the clinical presentation and prognosis showing worse
    prognosis among males 14-18.
    Abnormal laboratory markers including higher levels of leukocyte count, neutrophil count,
    highsensitivity C reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, interleukin (IL) 2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8,
    tumor necrosis factor α, D-dimer, fibrinogen, lactic dehydrogenase, and N-terminal pro-brain
    natriuretic peptide, raised cytokine and LDH, lower CD4 count and deranged lymphocyte count
    and others have been attributed as determinants of death in severe COVID 19                                   patients 12,18-20.
    Understanding the characteristics of severe COVID-19 patients and identifying those
    characteristics that lead to death in our setup is the key to make an informed decision to result in
    the most favorable outcome of treatment for each patient. Yet, there is no such study conducted
    in Ethiopia.
    Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the predictors of death in Severe COVID-19
    patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.
                                                                                                                                       3

    METHODS AND MATERIALS
    Study setting and Study population
    The study was conducted at the Millennium COVID-19 Care Center (MCCC). The center is the
    biggest COVID-19 center in the country with a capacity of 1000 bed including ICU patient
    management.
    The study design was a hospital-based case-control study.
    The source population was all patients admitted to MCCC with a confirmed diagnosis of
    COVID-19 using RT-PCR as reported by a laboratory given mandate to test such patients by the
    Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health 21.
        -    Case: all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infected patients admitted to MCCC and whose
             treatment outcome was death.
        -    Control: all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infected patients admitted to MCCC and
             who recovered from the disease and discharged alive.
    The study population was all selected COVID-19 patients who were on treatment and follow up
    at MCCC and who full fill the inclusion criteria.
    Sample Size Determination and Sampling Technique
    All COVID-19 related deaths in the Center since the Center started admission on June 2, 2020,
    up to September 10, 2020 (49 deaths) were included in the study. And with a 1:2 ratio of case to
    control, 49 deaths and 98 recovered patients, a total of 147 patients were included in the study.
    To select the controls, simple random sampling method was used.
    Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
    All COVID-19 patients who were on treatment and follow up at the Center during the
    observation period were included in the study.
    COVID-19 patients who were on treatment and follow at the Center during the observation
    period but whose outcome status is unknown due to transfer to other hospitals or any other
    reason that resulted in the discharge of the patient before the observation of the outcome were
    excluded.
    Operational Definitions
    Severe COVID-19 disease: Includes patients who have developed complications. The following
    features can define severe illness 22.
                                                                                                                                       4

             o Hypoxia: SPO2 ≤ 93% on atmospheric air or PaO2:FiO2 < 300mmHg (SF ratio <
                   315)
             o Tachypnea: in respiratory distress or RR>30 breaths/minutes
             o More than 50% involvement seen on chest imaging
    COVID-19 Death: A death due to COVID-19 is defined for surveillance purposes as a death
    resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless
    there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma).
    There should be no period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death 23.
    Data Collection Procedures and Quality Assurance
    Data abstraction tool consisting of all the variables of interest was developed from the patient
    registration and follow up form and used to abstract the necessary data from the patients’ chart.
    Amendment on the tool was made after a pre-test of the data abstraction tool was made on 5% of
    randomly selected charts.
    Training on the basics of the questionnaire and data collection tool was given for four data
    collectors (General practitioners) and one supervisor (General practitioner).
    Data consistency and completeness were checked before an attempt was made to enter the code
    and analyze the data.
    Data Management and Analysis
    The extracted data were coded, entered into Epi-Info version 7.2.1.0, cleaned, stored, and
    exported to SPSS version 25.0 software for analysis. Categorical covariates were summarized
    using frequencies and percentages. To assess the presence of a statistically significant difference
    between those who died and those who were discharged alive in terms of the independent
    variables, a chi-square test (for the categorical variables), and independent t-test (for the
    numerical variables) were run. The assumptions of a chi-square test, that no cell should have an
    expected frequency of less than 5, and the assumptions of t-test, normality of distribution, and
    equality of variance, were checked before the analysis, and the data was found to satisfy these
    assumptions. Variables with a p-value of ≤ 0.05 were considered as having a statistically
    significant difference in terms of COVID-19 outcome (Alive Vs Dead).
    The association between the outcome of the disease and predictor variables was assessed using
    Binary Logistic Regression. Univariate analysis was run at 25% level of significance to screen
    out independent variables to be used in the Multivariable Binary Logistic regression model. The
    adequacy of the final model was assessed using the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test
    and the final model fitted the data well (x2(8)=5.234 and p-value = 0.732). For the Binary Logistic
                                                                                                                                       5

    regression, a 95% confidence interval for AOR was calculated and variables with p-value ≤ 0.05
    were considered as statistically associated with the outcome of COVID-19 (Alive Vs Dead).
    RESULT
    Socio-demographic, co-morbid illness and medication use related variables and comparison
    between Alive Vs Dead group
    The majorities (25.9%) of the patients were ≥ 70 years and the smallest proportion was in the age
    range of 50-59 years (15.6%). More than two-thirds (72.8%) of the patients were males. Eighty-
    seven (59.2%) of the patients had a history of one or more pre-existing co-morbid illness. The
    commonest being hypertension (33.3%) followed by diabetes mellitus (30.6%), cardiac illness
    (12.9%), and chronic lung disease (COPD and /or asthma) (11.6%). Twenty patients (13.6%) had
    a history of medication use including ACEIS, ARBs, and/or NSAIDs within 14 days of
    admission.
    A statistically significant difference in the COVID-19 treatment outcome (Alive Vs Death) was
    found among the different age groups, those with a history of pre-existing co-morbid illness,
    hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Accordingly, a significantly greater proportion of patients in
    each age group from 27 to 69 years were discharged improved, on the contrary for those ≥ 70
    years and above a significant proportion has died (p-value=0.019). Regarding co-morbid illness
    history, those who died had a significantly higher proportion of patients with one or more pre-
    existing co-morbid illness (79.6% Vs 20.4%, p-value= 0.0001) compared with those with no co-
    morbid illness. Similarly, diabetic patients showed a significant association with death outcomes
    compared to those patients with no diabetes mellitus (53.3% Vs 46.7%, p-value= 0.001). On the
    other hand, a significant proportion of patients with a history of hypertension (51.0% Vs 49.0%,
    p-value= 0.004) were discharged alive compared to those with no such illness. (Table 1)

    Baseline vital sign and laboratory markers related variables and comparison between Alive
    Vs Dead group
    The independent t-test result shows that, compared to those who were discharged alive, patients
    who died had a significantly lower mean admission diastolic blood pressure (20.2 mmHg Vs
    78.2 mmHg, p-value=0.0001) and mean Spo2 (89.3% Vs 93.1%, p-value=0.001).
    On the laboratory biomarkers, those who died had significantly lower mean values of
    Hemoglobin (13.9 mg/dl Vs 14.9 mg/dl, 0.017, p-value=0.017), lymphocyte percent (4.1% Vs
    8.3%, p-value=0.003) and platelet count (245,300 Vs 318,800, p-value=0.002) and higher
    neutrophil percent (91.8% Vs 82.4%, p-value=0.0001) compared to those who were discharged

    Factors associated with death outcome in Severe COVID-19 patients
    Based on the result of the univariate analysis at 25% level of significance; Age group,
    hypertension, diabetes mellitus, fever, sore throat, chest pain and SOB were found to be
    significantly associated with COVID-19 treatment outcome.
    However; only history of diabetes mellitus, fever and SOB were found to be significantly
    associated with COVID-19 treatment outcome (Alive Vs dead) in the multiple Binary Logistic
    Regression model at 5% level of significance.
    Accordingly, after adjusting for other covariates, the odds of dying among those with a history of
    diabetes were 3.257 times compared to those with no diabetes (AOR= 3.257, 95% CI= 1.348,
    7.867, p-value=0.009).
    Patients who died were 67.2% less likely to have a history of fever at admission compared with
    those who recovered from the disease (AOR=0.328, 95% CI: 0.123, 0.878, p-value= 0.027).
    On the other hand, the odds of dying among patients who presented with shortness of breath at
    admission was 4.034 times compared to those with no such symptom (AOR= 4.034, 95% CI=
    1.481, 10.988, p-value=0.006). (Table 4)

    DISCUSSION
    In this study, we assessed the predictors of death in severe COVID-19 patients who were
    admitted at MCCC. The chi-square and independent t-test result showed that there was a
    significant difference in the underlying characteristics of patients who died and discharged alive,
    showing that the death group was significantly older, had one or more comorbid illness, had
    diabetes mellitus, had lower diastolic blood pressure and lower SPO2, lower hemoglobi,
    neutrophil predominance, relatively lower platelet count and raised urea, creatinine, and ALT.
    On the contrary, a significantly lower proportion of patients with hypertension, symptoms of
    fever, sore throat, and chest pain died compared to those discharged alive. This result shows the
    possible contribution of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics in disease outcome in the
    study setup.
    On the univariate analysis; Age group, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, fever, sore throat, chest
    pain, and SOB were found to be significantly associated with COVID-19 treatment outcome
    showing that these factors significantly contribute to disease outcome independently.
    On further analysis after controlling for other covariates, using a multivariable binary logistic
    regression, only three factors were found to be significant predictors of death in patients with
    severe disease; a history of diabetes mellitus, fever, and Shortness of breath at admission.
    Being diabetic was found to be an important predictor of disease outcome. The odds that those
    who died had a history of diabetes were 3.257 times compared with those who recovered from
    the disease. This could be because diabetes mellitus, especially if poorly controlled, is known to
    lead to compromised immunity that decreases the body’s ability to fight off any infection
    including viral infections like COVID-19. Also, the chances of having and/or developing another
    chronic illness are higher than non-diabetic individuals. This results in any diabetic patient to be
    vulnerable to develop symptomatic infection and complications from any infectious disease that
    could result in worse disease prognosis. This result also seems to be the case in others’ setup as it
                                                                                                                                     11

    is reported that having diabetes mellitus is associated with poor prognosis in studies conducted in
    China and England 14,17-19.
    The study found that having fever at admission is associated with having a favorable outcome of
    being discharged alive. Patients who died were 67.2% less likely to have a history of fever at
    admission compared with those who recovered from the disease. As fever is an indication of
    serious disease, it is also an indication of an active immune response of the body to infection
    including a virus in an attempt to prevent it from overtaking the body. Therefore, having
    symptoms of fever could imply that the patient has a competent immunity that is fighting the
    infection which in turn leads to a favorable disease outcome. In other words, a compromised
    immunity due to different causes means the immune system may not mount the ordinary
    reactions to threats like fever which leads the person to have a higher risk of serious infection.
    In addition, the result of the study found that having SOB at admission is one of the significant
    factors that predict having a death outcome. The odds that those who died had a history of SOB
    at presentation were 4.034 times those who recovered from the disease. Shortness of breath is a
    manifestation of decreased lung function and is considered as a sign of a life-threatening
    condition. Patients with persistent shortness of breath complaint are those with such lower lung
    reserve, functional or anatomical cause, that makes them vulnerable to a virus like COVID-19
    and are unable to cope with the stress leading to a bad prognosis.
    On the other hand, the other risk factors identified in most studies like old age, male sex, and
    hypertension didn’t show any significant effect on disease outcome in the final regression model
    14,17,18,20
                . Age group and hypertension showed a significant association in the chi-square test and
    a significant association on the univariate binary logistic regression but didn’t show any
    predictive effect on the multivariable binary logistic regression. On the other hand, Sex didn’t
    show any association or predictive value on the chi-square test and binary logistic regression
    model (both univariate and multivariate).
    The other important determinants identified in most studies are deranged laboratory parameters
    12,18-20
              but in our study, the only laboratory parameters assessed for all patients are complete
    blood cell count, renal function test, and liver function, and none showed any significant
    association. Other relevant parameters were not assessed for the patients during the clinical
    course due to the unavailability of the laboratory tests and reagents.
    CONCLUSION
    Being diabetic and having SOB at admission were found to be predictors of death in Severe
    COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, having a fever at admission was associated with a
    favorable outcome of being discharged alive.
                                                                                                                                     12

    We recommend a more careful follow-up and management of diabetic patients. In addition, a
    more strict infection prevention practice should be advised to diabetic individuals. A more
    careful evaluation of patients with SOB should be done with a more sensitive triaging method to
    pick the symptom. Furthermore, SOB can be used as a warning sign in a patient follow-up to
    provide early detection and intervention for a favorable outcome.
