74     ABSTRACT
75     Background
76     Healthcare resource constraints in low and middle-income countries necessitate selection of
77     cost-effective public health interventions to address COVID-19.
78
79     Methods
80     We developed a dynamic COVID-19 microsimulation model to evaluate clinical and economic
81     outcomes and cost-effectiveness of epidemic control strategies in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
82     Interventions assessed were Healthcare Testing (HT), where diagnostic testing is performed
83     only for those presenting to healthcare centres; Contact Tracing (CT) in households of cases;
84     Isolation Centres (IC), for cases not requiring hospitalisation; community health worker-led Mass
85     Symptom Screening and molecular testing for symptomatic individuals (MS); and Quarantine
86     Centres (QC), for household contacts who test negative. Given uncertainties about epidemic
87     dynamics in South Africa, we evaluated two main epidemic scenarios over 360 days, with
88     effective reproduction numbers (Re) of 1·5 and 1·2. We compared HT, HT+CT, HT+CT+IC,
89     HT+CT+IC+MS, HT+CT+IC+QC, and HT+CT+IC+MS+QC, considering strategies with
90     incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) <US$3,250/year-of-life saved (YLS) cost-effective.
91     In sensitivity analyses, we varied Re, molecular testing sensitivity, and efficacies and costs of
92     interventions.
93
94     Findings
95     With Re 1·5, HT resulted in the most COVID-19 deaths over 360 days. Compared with HT,
96     HT+CT+IC+MS+QC reduced mortality by 94%, increased costs by 33%, and was cost-effective
97     (ICER $340/YLS). In settings where quarantine centres cannot be implemented,
98     HT+CT+IC+MS was cost-effective compared with HT (ICER $590/YLS). With Re 1·2,
99     HT+CT+IC+QC was the least costly strategy, and no other strategy was cost-effective.
                                                                                                                                          4

100     HT+CT+IC+MS+QC was cost-effective in many sensitivity analyses; notable exceptions were
101     when Re was 2·6 and when efficacies of ICs and QCs for transmission reduction were reduced.
102
103     Interpretation
104     In South Africa, strategies involving household contact tracing, isolation, mass symptom
105     screening, and quarantining household contacts who test negative would substantially reduce
106     COVID-19 mortality and be cost-effective. The optimal combination of interventions depends on
107     epidemic growth characteristics and practical implementation considerations.

113     INTRODUCTION
114     By early September 2020, 16 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) had reported over 10,000
115     COVID-19 cases.1 High urban density, limited opportunities for physical distancing, and poor
116     access to hygiene interventions raise the risk of severe epidemics in the region.2 The existing
117     public health infrastructure for epidemic response in SSA is also of concern: testing capacity,
118     surveillance infrastructure, isolation facilities, and intensive care (ICU) services are sparse.3,4
119
120     Low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are implementing epidemic control programs. The
121     World Health Organization (WHO) promotes establishment of disease surveillance platforms,
122     contact tracing, and isolation facilities.5 Epidemiologic models of these interventions have
123     generally suggested that their efficacy depends on intervention adherence and transmission
124     dynamics.6,7 Yet few studies have included resource costs to examine their cost-effectiveness
125     and feasibility. Limitations in human resources, public health financing, and healthcare facility
126     availability necessitate particular attention to these issues in LMICs.
127
128     We used a dynamic microsimulation model to compare medical outcomes and costs for a range
129     of COVID-19 control measures in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Our objective was to inform
130     policy decision making by projecting clinical and economic outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and
131     budget impact of alternative control strategies, focusing on those proposed or currently in use in
132     South Africa. Though the first wave of diagnosed COVID-19 cases in South Africa peaked in
133     July 2020, this analysis can inform preparation for or response to a resurgence or subsequent
134     waves.
                                                                                                                                           6

135     METHODS
136     Analytic Overview
137     We developed the Clinical and Economic Analysis of COVID Interventions (CEACOV) dynamic
138     state-transition Monte Carlo microsimulation model to reflect COVID-19 natural history,
139     diagnosis, and treatment. We compared six public health intervention strategies (figure S1). In
140     all strategies: (a) testing consists of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for severe acute
141     respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on a nasopharyngeal specimen; (b) those
142     awaiting test results are instructed to self-isolate; (c) those severely ill (with dyspnoea and/or
143     hypoxemia), regardless of test result, are admitted to hospital until hospital capacity is reached;
144     (d) those with a negative test result are advised to practice physical distancing and hand
145     hygiene; (e) those with an initial negative test result can present for repeat testing if they
146     develop new or worsening symptoms; (f) those not initially admitted to hospital can be admitted
147     later if they develop severe illness. Unique characteristics of each modelled strategy are:
148
149               1) Healthcare Testing (HT): Approximately 30% of people with mild/moderate COVID-
150               19-like symptoms and all with severe symptoms self-present to a healthcare centre for
151               testing. Those with a positive result and not severely ill are instructed to self-isolate at
152               home.
153
154               2) Contact Tracing (HT+CT): In addition to HT, household contacts of COVID-19 cases
155               are tested. Those with a positive result are instructed to self-isolate at home.
156
157               3) Contact Tracing + Isolation Centre (HT+CT+IC): In addition to HT+CT, cases who are
158               not severely ill are referred to an isolation centre (IC) offering food, shelter, and basic
159               medical care without supplemental oxygen. They are discharged after 14 days.
160
                                                                                                                                           7

                                                                          Cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 interventions in South Africa
161               4) Contact Tracing + Isolation Centre + Mass Symptom Screening (HT+CT+IC+MS): In
162               addition to HT+CT+IC, community healthcare workers screen the entire population for
163               COVID-19 symptoms every 6 months and refer those with symptoms for PCR testing.
164               Individuals with a positive PCR test but not severely ill are referred to an IC. As a frame
165               of reference, epidemic control measures in South Africa in June 2020 included
166               combinations of HT, CT, IC, and MS.
167
168               5) Contact Tracing + Isolation Centre + Quarantine Centre (HT+CT+IC+QC): In addition
169               to HT+CT+IC, household contacts with a negative test result who cannot safely
170               quarantine at home are referred to a quarantine centre (QC) where they receive food
171               and shelter. They are discharged after 14 days, unless they develop COVID-19-like
172               symptoms, in which case they are referred to ICs or hospitals, as available.
173
174               6) Contact Tracing + Isolation Centre + Mass Symptom Screening + Quarantine Centre
175               (HT+CT+IC+MS+QC): This is a combination of all measures described above.

177     Starting with SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence of 0·1%, we simulated COVID-19-specific
178     outcomes over 360 days, including daily and cumulative infections (detected and undetected),
179     deaths, resource utilization, and healthcare costs from the health sector perspective without
180     discounting. Outside the model, we calculated the average lifetime years-of-life saved (YLS)
181     from each averted COVID-19 death during the 360-day model horizon, which equated to 16·8
182     life-years (appendix p.5-6). The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
183     (ICER), the difference in healthcare costs (2019 US dollars [US$]) divided by the difference in
184     life-years between strategies. We did not include costs beyond the 360-day model horizon.
185     Average non-HIV public health expenditures in South Africa are approximately $600/year per
186     capita;8,9 including those annual costs over a lifetime yields a lifetime ICER approaching
                                                                                                                                           8

187     $600/YLS. Therefore, our ICER estimates include healthcare costs during the 360-day model
188     horizon and YLS over a lifetime from averted COVID-19 deaths during the 360-day model
189     horizon. Recognizing no established threshold, we judged an ICER less than $3,250/YLS cost-
190     effective, based on an opportunity cost approach (appendix p.2).10
191
192     Model Structure
193     Health States and Natural History
194     At simulation initiation, each individual is either susceptible to, or infected with, SARS-CoV-2
195     according to age-stratified probabilities (0-19, 20-59, ≥60 years). Once infected, an individual
196     transitions to the pre-infectious latency state. Each individual faces an age-dependent
197     probability of developing asymptomatic, mild/moderate, severe, or critical disease (appendix
198     p.2, table S1, figure S2). Those with critical disease face daily probabilities of death. If they
199     survive, they pass through a recuperation state (remaining infectious) before going to the
200     recovery state. Those in other disease states can transition directly to the recovery state.
201     “Recovered” individuals pose no risk of transmission and are assumed immune from repeat
202     infection for the simulation duration. All simulated individuals advance through the model
203     simultaneously to capture infection transmission dynamics. To validate our natural history
204     assumptions, we compared model-projected COVID-19 deaths with those reported in KwaZulu-
205     Natal (appendix p.4).
206
207     Transmission
208     Individuals in asymptomatic, mild/moderate, severe, critical, or recuperation states of COVID-19
209     may transmit infection to susceptible individuals at state-dependent daily rates. The number of
210     daily infections is a function of the proportion of susceptible people in the population, the
211     distribution of disease states among those with COVID-19, and interventions that influence
212     transmission (appendix p.3).
                                                                                                                                           9

213
214     Testing and Interventions
215     PCR testing specifications include sensitivity, specificity, time from testing to result, and
216     cost. Interventions influence testing probability (e.g., CT and MS), infection transmission rate
217     (e.g., IC and QC), and costs.
218
219     Resource Utilization
220     Individuals with severe or critical disease are referred to hospitals and ICUs, respectively. If
221     those resources are not available, the individual receives the next lower available intervention,
222     which is associated with a different mortality risk and cost (e.g., if a person needs ICU care
223     when no ICU beds are available, s/he receives non-ICU hospital care).
224
225     Model Calibration
226     We populated CEACOV with COVID-19 natural history data from published literature (table
227     1). We used estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) and viral shedding duration in
228     various disease states to calculate transmission rates. We then calibrated transmission rates to
229     construct an effective reproduction number (Re) corresponding to South African estimates in
230     May 2020, after implementation of physical distancing and lockdown policies (appendix p.4).11
231
232     Input Parameters
233     Cohort Characteristics
234     We defined cohort demographic characteristics using 2019 population estimates (table 1).12 In
235     KwaZulu-Natal, 40.26% were aged 0-19 years, 51.48% were 20-59 years, and 8.26% were over
236     60 years. Day 0 of the model represents a provincial 0·1% prevalence (approximately 11,000
237     individuals) of active SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the remainder of the population susceptible to
238     infection.

239
240     Natural History
241     For those newly infected with SARS-CoV-2, average pre-infectious latency was 2·6 days. Table
242     S1 indicates duration in each state, age-dependent probability of developing severe or critical
243     disease, and age-dependent mortality for those with critical disease.
244
245     Transmission
246     We stratified transmission rates by disease state (table 1). We adjusted transmission rates to
247     reflect Re=1·5.11 Given uncertainty over Re, both in the past and future, we also simulated
248     alternative epidemic growth scenarios with lower (1·1 or 1·2) or higher (2·6) Re (appendix p.4).
249
250     Testing and Interventions
251     In the base case, we assumed a 70% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and five days to PCR result
252     return and action across all active infection states.13 We defined the probability of undergoing
253     testing based on the health state and intervention strategy in place (table S2, appendix p.7).
254     Given limited data about the precise efficacy of each intervention for reducing SARS-CoV-2
255     transmission rates (e.g., IC), we made assumptions about efficacies and varied them in
256     sensitivity analysis. Ongoing transmission after diagnosis was reduced by 50% from HT alone
257     and by 95% when HT was combined with ICs or QCs (table S2).
258
259     Resource Utilization and Costs
260     The maximum capacity of hospital and ICU beds was 26,220 and 748 per 11 million people, as
261     reported for KwaZulu-Natal (table 1).14 We assumed that IC and QC beds were available to all
262     who needed them. We applied costs of PCR testing, contact tracing, and mass symptom
263     screening, as well as daily costs of hospitalisation, ICU stay, and IC/QC stays based on
264     published estimates and/or cost quotes obtained in KwaZulu-Natal (appendix p.6).

265
266     Resource Utilization and Budget Impact Analysis
267     We conducted resource utilization and budget impact analysis from a combined public/private
268     health sector perspective for KwaZulu-Natal (population 11 million). We projected the total
269     resources, including testing, hospital/ICU beds, and IC/QC beds, that would be used in each
270     intervention strategy. IC/QC beds are offered to those who meet criteria, and we assumed in the
271     base case that all offered would be used. In budget impact analysis, we projected total and
272     component healthcare costs associated with each strategy over 360 days and compared them
273     with the 2019 KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health budget of $3·12 billion.15 Because ICU care
274     is relatively expensive and mostly in the private sector, we also considered costs exclusive of
275     ICU care.
276
277     Sensitivity Analysis
278     We conducted one-way sensitivity analysis by varying key parameters across plausible ranges
279     to determine the impact on clinical and cost projections (table 1, table S2). To extrapolate to
280     other settings, we limited hospital and ICU bed availability to the average numbers in SSA
281     countries (22,275 and 371 per 11 million people).16 We performed multi-way sensitivity analysis
282     in which we varied parameters influential in one-way sensitivity analysis, including reducing
283     IC/QC efficacy and costs to reflect the impact of home-based isolation and quarantine
284     strategies.

285     RESULTS
286     For an epidemic with Re=1·5, we projected that HT would result in the most COVID-19
287     infections and deaths, most life-years lost, and lowest costs over 360 days (table 2, figures S3-
288     S4). HT+CT+IC+MS+QC provided the greatest clinical benefit and was cost-effective (ICER
289     $340/YLS) (figure 1). HT+CT+IC+MS+QC decreased life-years lost by 94% and increased costs
290     by 33% compared with HT. All other strategies resulted in higher costs while providing less
291     clinical benefit than HT+CT+IC+MS+QC. In settings where quarantine centres cannot be
292     implemented, HT+CT+IC+MS was the cost-effective strategy (ICER $590/YLS compared with
293     HT).
294
295     With Re=1·2, HT+CT+IC+QC was cost-saving compared with HT (table 2). HT+CT+IC+MS+QC
296     resulted in 48% fewer life-years lost but was not cost-effective (ICER $27,590/YLS) compared
297     with HT+CT+IC+QC. HT+CT+IC was the least costly strategy in settings where quarantine
298     centres cannot be implemented, and other strategies were not cost-effective compared with
299     HT+CT+IC.
300
301     Regarding resource utilization, with Re=1·5, HT resulted in the highest peak daily use of hospital
302     beds (table 3). Compared with HT, HT+CT+IC+MS+QC increased cumulative PCR test usage
303     by 2.6 times (though with lower peak daily PCR use) and reduced peak daily hospital bed use
304     by 86% (due to fewer cumulative infections), while requiring 12,380 IC beds and 18,140 QC
305     beds at peak daily use. Only the HT+CT+IC+MS, HT+CT+IC+QC, and HT+CT+IC+MS+QC
306     strategies maintained peak daily ICU bed demand below provincial capacity.
307
308     With Re=1·2, compared with HT, HT+CT+IC+MS+QC increased cumulative PCR test usage by
309     4.1 times and reduced peak daily hospital bed use by 66%, while requiring 1,860 IC beds and
                                                                                                                                          13

310     3,480 QC beds at peak daily use. All strategies except HT maintained peak daily ICU bed
311     demand below capacity.
312
313     Over 360 days, for an epidemic with Re=1·5, PCR testing contributed 9-27% to overall costs,
314     depending on the strategy (figure 2). In strategies with QCs, these centres contributed 26-30%
315     to overall costs. In strategies without QCs, ICU care was the largest contributor to costs, ranging
316     from 38-71%. Costs exclusive of ICU care were $125 million (HT), $413 million
317     (HT+CT+IC+MS), and $461 million (HT+CT+IC+MS+QC), reflecting approximately 4%, 13%,
318     and 15% of the 2019 KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health budget. CT and MS together
319     contributed ≤10% and ICs contributed 22-31% to overall costs in strategies in which they were
320     used. For an epidemic with Re=1·2, costs exclusive of ICU care were $71 million (HT), $159
321     million (HT+CT+IC+MS), and $167 million (HT+CT+IC+MS+QC), reflecting 2%, 5%, and 5% of
322     the 2019 KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health budget.
323
324     In sensitivity analyses, results were similar to the base case (i.e., HT+CT+IC+MS+QC remained
325     cost-effective) when varying costs of CT and MS (table S3) and hospitalisation (table S4);
326     varying PCR sensitivity and time to result (table S5) and PCR cost (table S6); and varying
327     availability of hospital and ICU beds (table S7). When PCR sensitivity increased to 90%, both
328     HT+CT+IC+MS (ICER $440/YLS) and HT+CT+IC+MS+QC (ICER $1,660/YLS) used resources
329     efficiently.
330
331     Conversely, our projected ICERs changed meaningfully in a model with Re=2·6 – resource
332     requirements increased substantially, making HT+CT+IC+MS+QC no longer cost-effective
333     (ICER $25,040/YLS), and all strategies had ICERs above our cost-effectiveness threshold
334     compared with HT (table S8). The pattern of results with Re=1·1 was similar to that with Re=1·2
335     (table S8). When the efficacies of CT and MS to detect infections were halved from the base
                                                                                                                                          14

336     case values, HT+CT+IC+MS+QC was no longer cost-effective (ICER $5,930/YLS) (table S9).
337     When the efficacy of ICs/QCs for transmission reduction was decreased from 95% to 75%,
338     HT+CT+IC+MS+QC was not cost-effective ($12,490/YLS) (table S10). When the IC/QC costs
339     decreased, HT+CT+IC+MS+QC became more favourable in terms of cost-effectiveness, and it
340     remained cost-effective when IC/QC costs were double those of the base case (table S11).
341
342     In a multi-way sensitivity analysis that varied CT/MS efficacy and reduced IC/QC efficacy and
343     cost to assess lower-cost but potentially lower-efficacy home-based IC and QC programs,
344     HT+CT+IC+MS+QC or HT+CT+IC+QC were cost-effective in nearly all scenarios in which
345     CT/MS efficacy for case detection was double that of the base case efficacy (figure S5). When
346     CT/MS efficacy for case detection was half that of the base case efficacy, strategies involving
347     quarantine centres were less likely to be cost-effective. If quarantine centers were not an option,
348     then HT+CT+IC+MS was cost-effective in most scenarios (figure S6).

350     DISCUSSION
351     Public health strategies combining contact tracing, isolation of those with confirmed COVID-19,
352     community-based mass symptom screening, and quarantine of household contacts of confirmed
353     cases will substantially reduce infections, hospitalisations, and deaths while efficiently using
354     healthcare resources in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We estimate that a strategy combining all
355     interventions would cost an additional $340 per year-of-life saved, which compares favourably
356     with the cost-effectiveness of many established public health interventions in South Africa,
357     including tuberculosis diagnostic testing17 and cervical cancer screening.18 In scenarios in which
358     implementation of quarantine centres cannot be accomplished, a strategy of contact tracing,
359     isolation centres, and mass symptom screening would be cost-effective.
360
361     Notably, the cost-effectiveness of strategies was sensitive to epidemic growth conditions. We
362     conducted sensitivity analyses intended to generalize to other settings with resource
363     constraints, to epidemics at varying degrees of acceleration (including published estimates in
364     South Africa11,19), and with varying intervention costs.20 With low epidemic growth (Re 1·1-1·2),
365     HT+CT+IC+QC was the optimal strategy; QCs remained cost-effective but adding MS was not
366     cost-effective. With high epidemic growth (Re 2·6), when the epidemic outpaced control
367     measures and costs increased substantially, no combination of the modelled interventions was
368     cost-effective compared with HT alone.
369
370     Our model parameters and specifications were selected for their relevance to LMICs. Our
371     estimates are based on the population structure of KwaZulu-Natal, with a median age of 25
372     years (compared with 38 years in the USA), and thus are likely to reflect epidemic scenarios in
373     LMICs with similarly young age structures. We chose intervention scenarios based on prior work
374     supporting their efficacy for epidemic control, WHO recommendations, and particular relevance
375     to settings with limitations in formal healthcare infrastructure.5–7 We did not limit the PCR testing

376     availability – so that the total number of tests needed and associated costs could be estimated –
377     and peak PCR use reached approximately 10,000-15,000 tests/day in the optimal strategies,
378     marginally above established capacity in KwaZulu-Natal during the recent surge.21 We specified
379     the model to reflect the number of available hospital and ICU beds in KwaZulu-Natal,14 and
380     results were similar when we further restricted bed availability to that elsewhere in SSA.16
381     Contact tracing and community-based screening have been frequently used for case-finding in
382     LMICs.22 Many SSA countries are thus theoretically poised to implement such interventions
383     through established networks of community health workers. Finally, isolation centres, which are
384     likely to require the greatest investment in new infrastructure, have been implemented
385     successfully in response to Ebola epidemics in West Africa and the Democratic Republic of
386     Congo, where healthcare resources are among the lowest in the world.23 South Africa has
387     rapidly implemented and expanded COVID-19 related services in recent months, but further
388     scale-up would be required to meet demand in some of our modelled scenarios.21,24
389
390     Isolation centres in our model are designed as housing facilities for people with confirmed
391     COVID-19 who do not require hospital-level care but cannot safely isolate at home. We
392     estimated that their use reduces ongoing transmission after a confirmed diagnosis from 50% (in
393     the HT strategy) to 5%. They are likely to be most effective in areas with high household density
394     and limited capacity for in-home isolation, as is the case for many urban centres in SSA.
395     Quarantine centres, which include optional housing for contacts who test negative and cannot
396     safely distance during the latency period, have also been proposed for interrupting epidemic
397     spread and were implemented in the early phases of the COVID-19 response in China. They
398     were effective in our model at reducing the deleterious impact of the epidemic and were cost-
399     effective in many modelled scenarios.

401     Importantly, there are critical social and human rights considerations to implementation of
402     isolation and quarantine in many settings, due to trade-offs between public health benefits and
403     civil liberties.25 In our model, both interventions are provided optionally for those who cannot do
404     so safely at home, but we conservatively included costs to reflect needs should they be used.
405     We also considered the use of home-based isolation and quarantine in a multi-way analysis that
406     reduced efficacies and costs of both. We found that isolation and quarantine remained cost-
407     effective in some lower efficacy scenarios, particularly if their costs were also reduced. On
408     balance, from a public health perspective, our findings support use of quarantine centres in
409     areas with individual and community support for their use.
410
411     Our model should be interpreted within the context of several limitations. We did not account for
412     heterogenous mixing within the population. Instead, we assumed that contact patterns were
413     random, as commonly done in infectious disease models. We assumed that the age-adjusted
414     prevalence of non-communicable co-morbidities in South Africa would be similar to that in in the
415     US and that age would be the primary driver of COVID-19 outcomes as demonstrated in
416     multiple settings.26–28 In line with most published studies, we conservatively assumed no
417     modifying effect of HIV on the severity of COVID-19, though additional data are needed from
418     HIV-endemic countries to support this.28,29 If the high prevalence of non-communicable diseases
419     and/or HIV in South Africa does worsen COVID-19 outcomes compared with resource-rich
420     settings, then the benefit of public health interventions in terms of years-of-life saved and cost-
421     effectiveness will likely be greater than our estimates. Nonetheless, in extending projections
422     beyond the 360-day model horizon, we accounted for South Africa-specific mortality rates in our
423     calculations of life expectancy and years-of-life lost. It will be crucial to consider how resources
424     and interventions implemented in response to COVID-19 will impact available resources for
425     other regional healthcare priorities. We did not include lifetime costs of healthcare beyond
426     COVID-19 or of sequelae among the recovered, and we did not account for impacts of COVID-
                                                                                                                                          18

427     19 interventions on other economic sectors. As with all modelling exercises, our estimates are
428     determined by assumptions of input parameters. We selected COVID-19 clinical parameters
429     based on the published literature, which are largely derived from high-income settings.
430     Intervention efficacy estimates were hypothesized based on other model parameters, existing
431     literature where available, or expert opinion if no data were available. Recognizing a lack of
432     empiric data for some of these estimates, we focused our sensitivity analyses on varying those
433     for which data was lacking. Finally, costing data were derived from the literature and direct cost
434     estimates from local suppliers in KwaZulu-Natal and therefore might not reflect costs in other
435     contexts nor full implementation and scale-up costs. Nonetheless, our primary findings and
436     policy conclusions were largely consistent across a range of costing estimates.
437
438     We recommend that policymakers consider contact tracing, isolation of confirmed cases, mass
439     symptom screening, and quarantine of household contacts of cases to address COVID-19
440     epidemic control efficiently. Where quarantine centres are not feasible – for example, due to
441     budget constraints or lack of public support – a strategy that includes the other interventions
442     would still provide clinical benefit in an economically efficient manner.

    cost-effective strategy is highlighted in light grey in each Re scenario. The displayed life-years and
    costs are rounded, but the ICER was calculated with non-rounded life-years and costs.
    *We assumed that each death results in 16·8 life-years lost, on average, based on our derivation

        ‡
          The ICER is the difference between two strategies in costs divided by the difference in undiscounted
        life-years (16·8 YLS per averted COVID-19 death, see appendix p.5-6). We considered a strategy
        cost-effective if its ICER was less than US$3,250/YLS.10 When we used life-years discounted 3%/year
        (12·5 discounted YLS per averted COVID-19 death), cost-effectiveness interpretations were
        unchanged: in the Re=1·5 scenario, HT+CT+IC+MS+QC remained cost-effective with ICER $460/YLS
        compared with HT; in the Re=1·2 scenario, HT+CT+IC+MS+QC had ICER $37,210/YLS compared
        with HT+CT+IC+QC.

583   Model results are shown for an effective reproduction number of 1·5. Strategies that are below the
584   line are dominated – i.e., an inefficient use of resources compared with other strategies. For non-
585   dominated strategies, ICERs are shown below the strategy label.

595   Panel A shows results for an epidemic with Re=1·5, and Panel B shows results for an epidemic
596   with Re=1·2. The figures show the total and component COVID-19-related healthcare costs, from
597   a health sector perspective, associated with different intervention strategies when applied to the
598   entire KwaZulu-Natal population of 11 million people. The costs are derived from model-generated
599   results. Percentages in parentheses represent the proportion of the 2019 KwaZulu-Natal
600   Department of Health budget.
