 1    Abstract
 2    Alzheimer disease(AD) affects profoundly the quality of human life. Quantifying the
 3    severity degree of Alzheimer dementia for an individual person is critical for the early
 4    diagnose and prescription for delaying the further dementia progression. However, the
 5    quantitative diagnose for human subjects of the mild cognitively impairment(MCI) or
 6    AD with the different degree of dementia severity is a difficult task due to both the very
 7    broad distribution of dementia severities and the lack of good quantitative determinant
 8    to assess it. Here, based on cortical thickness profiles of human brains measured by
 9    magnetic resonance experiment, a new algebraic approach is presented for the
10    personalized quantification of the severity degree of AD, ranging from 0 for the basin
11    of cognitively normal state to 1 for AD state. Now one can unfold the broad distribution
12    of dementia severities and corresponding cortex regions of human brains with MCI or
13    AD by the different severity degree.

 1    Introduction
 2    Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most well-known neurodegenerative diseases,
 3    and it profoundly affects the quality of human life. Various causes of AD are known,
 4    and clinical treatments for preventing or delaying the progression of AD are currently
 5    practiced. The precise diagnosis of AD requires not only the systematic identification
 6    of cohorts that classify the different stages of brain progression toward AD but also the
 7    estimation of the severity degree of AD for a given individual (Galvin et al., 2012,
 8    Solomon and Soininen, 2015, Raj et al., 2012). The symptoms of AD appear in various
 9    forms in the human body, behavior, and cognition, yet the direct anatomical evidences
10    appear in the structural change within the brain cortex (Hojjati et al., 2019, Kim et al.,
11    2020, Qiu et al., 2020, Tetreault et al., 2020). Among these evidences is the
12    degradation of the cortical thickness of the human brain, which is one of the imprints
13    of AD. Such physical change can be monitored through the neuro-image analysis, for
14    example the magnetic resonance image (MRI) analysis of the brain (Hartikainen et al.,
15    2012, Im et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2014, Lebedev et al., 2013, Paternico et al., 2016,
16    Querbes et al., 2009).
17    The anatomical degradation of the cortical thickness becomes more pronounced as
18    the degree of dementia becomes greater (Im et al., 2008, Querbes et al., 2009).
19    Therefore, there is a rationale for taking advantage of the degree of cortical
20    degradation for determining the dementia cohort and estimating the severity of
21    dementia progression. Given the big data information of cortical thickness for a single
22    subject, however, we are faced with several obstacles to overcome in accomplishing
23    abovementioned tasks. First, we noted that the person-to-person fluctuations in
24    cortical thickness of an individual may overwhelm the degradation in cortical thickness.
25    In clinical cases, we frequently observed that the average cortical thickness of some
                                                                      3

 1    cognitively normal people is thinner than that of people with AD, which appears to
 2    contrast conventional view. The second obstacle is the ambiguity in what we should
 3    do if two different cohorts have a difference in the cortical thickness in brain regions
 4    that have little to do with AD. In principle, we should construct some determinants for
 5    distinguishing a cognitively normal person from a person with AD based on cortical
 6    thickness, but in practice, we are confronted with the differences in cortical thickness
 7    in regions of the cortex that are unrelated to the pathogenesis of AD. We noted that
 8    the abundant existence of such unrelated regions is an intrinsic source that increases
 9    the uncertainty of the dementia determinants and hinders the appropriate construction
10    of good classifier and predictor for AD.
11    In this study, instead of dealing with all 327,684 vertices point on the whole cortex of
12    a human brain, we demonstrated that the consideration of a few hundred essential
13    vertices were enough for distinguishing CN, MCI, AD cohorts each other. With cortical
14    thickness data at these essential vertices, we defined the statistical score matrix and
15    the covariance correlation matrix between human subjects as a set of classifier and
16    predictor for AD. Unlike the conventional view that the degradation of the cortical
17    thickness of human brain was responsible for AD, the singular valued decomposition
18    analysis of the statistical score matrix developed in this study implicated that the
19    simultaneous consideration of both thinner and thicker cortical regions together
20    compared to those of CN are important and necessary for the precise diagnose of the
21    severity of AD.

 2    Preparation of cortical thickness data from MRI of 1522 human brain
 3    images from ADNI
 4    Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease
 5    Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched
 6    in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by principal investigator Michael W. Weiner,
 7    MD. The primary goal of the ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other
 8    biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined
 9    to measure the progression of MCI and early Alzheimer’s disease. For up-to-date
10    information, see www.adni-info.org.
11    We selected 274 individuals (human subjects) who were identified as CN, 265
12    individuals with MCI, 125 individuals with AD from the ADNI-2 study of ADNI, and 97
13    with MCI from the ADNI-GO study of ADNI. A human brain image-data set of 1522 MR
14    images from a total of 761 subjects was constructed, for each of which both 1.2-mm
15    sagittal      Magnetization                Prepared          Rapid      Gradient        Echo        (MPRAGE)            and
16    MPRAGE_SENSE2 images were taken separately.
17
18    Partition 1516 MR images of human brains into four groups and determine
19    the essential region-of-interest vertices for each group
20    We performed the FreeSurfer analysis to obtain the cortical thickness data at 327,684
21    vertices on the cortex of a human brain (Dale et al., 1999, Fischl et al., 1999). The
22    cortical thickness at each vertex ranges from 0 mm to 5 mm. After eliminating those
23    vertices at which cortical thickness information was missing for any one of the 1522
24    MR images of human brains in the ADNI data set, 276,825 common vertices whose
                                                                      5

 1    In order to assign subjects from each CN, MCI, and AD cohort into one of the four
 2    groups (A-D) of average cortical thickness, we employed the Z score criteria in
 3    selecting the region-of-interest (ROI) vertices and the essential ROI vertices on the
 4    cortex at which the distribution of cortical thickness of the CN cohort is distinguished
 5    from that of the AD cohort within each group of average cortical thickness. A similar
 6    procedure is repeated for distinguishing the CN cohort from the MCI cohort and also
 7    the MCI cohort from the AD cohort:

11    deviation, and 𝑛𝑝,ℎ∈𝑘 is the number of MR images belonging to the k cohort. The
12    positive (negative) value of 𝑍𝑝CN-AD , for example, indicates that the distribution curve
13    of the average cortical thickness of the CN cohort is right (or left)-shifted compared to
14    that of AD cohort. And the bigger the absolute value of the Z score, the better
15    distinguished the distribution curves of average cortical thickness of the cohorts. In
16    this study, we identified ROI vertices satisfying the absolute value of the Z score larger
17    than 1.5, and essential ROI vertices satisfying much higher cut-off Z scores (Table S1).

      With this statistical score matrix 𝑆𝑝,𝑚 , we employed a strategy for determining to which
15    one of k cohorts a given subject would belong. First, we evaluated the averaged
16    cortical thickness of a given subject over 276,825 vertices. Second, we assigned this
17    subject to one of four groups (A-D) of average cortical thickness. Third, based on the
18    preselected essential ROI vertices p for the assigned group, we determined the
19    cortical thickness index m’(p) at which the cortical thickness at an essential ROI vertex
20    p is between (𝑚 − 1)𝛥 and 𝑚𝛥. Then, for each k cohort, the total score 𝑆(𝑘)                                       ′

 1    Results
 2    Identification of essential ROI vertices at which the distributions of
 3    cortical thickness of CN, MCI, AD subjects are distinguishable
 4    Although the averaged cortical thickness of subjects with AD is generally known to be
 5    thinner than that of CN or MCI subjects, the distribution curves of averaged cortical
 6    thickness for the cohorts are not well distinguishable except near both ends of the
 7    distribution curves as demonstrated in Figure 1A. This illustrates that a subject can be
 8    CN even though the averaged cortical thickness is thinner than that of a subject with
 9    AD, and vice versa. Also, we found that many subjects identified as CN, MCI, or AD
10    have a similar averaged cortical thickness. This is due to the fact that the average
11    cortical thickness for a subject was calculated over all 276,825 vertices, and the
12    cortical thicknesses at most vertices are similar for all subjects, which prohibits us from
13    successfully clustering 1552 human brain images into the image of CN, MCI, AD
14    cohorts. Therefore, instead of resorting on the cortical thickness of all 276,825 vertices,
15    we need to select the ROI vertices at which the cortical thickness values are
16    distinguishable from each other among CN, MCI, and AD. For a fair selection of such
17    ROI vertices, we divided the range of the averaged cortical thickness of subjects into
18    four (A-D) different regions (for the detailed method, see in the section 2.2).
19    Figure 1B illustrates how we identified ROI and essential ROI vertices. The x-axis

21    the distribution curves of cortical thickness for CN subjects and AD subjects at a vertex
22    p normalized by the dispersion of the cortical thickness of CN subjects, which is
23    quantified            by            the        value         of         its     Z        score.        The          y-axis

 2    dispersion of the cortical thickness of individuals with AD. Therefore, the x-values (y-
 3    values) at a vertex point p represent the degree by which the distribution of cortical
 4    thickness at this point p of CN (AD) subjects is distinguished from averaged cortical
 5    thickness of subjects with AD (CN). It means the larger the value of (𝑍𝑝CN-AD )2 =
 6    [𝑥 −2 + 𝑦 −2 ]−1 is, the two distribution curves are more distinguished each other (for the
 7    illustration, see Figure S1). The ROI cut-off line is defined by points satisfying
 8    |𝑍𝑝CN-AD | = 1.5, and the distribution of cortical thickness of CN subjects and individuals
 9    with AD is clearly distinguished at those points satisfying |𝑍𝑝CN-AD | > 1.5 (outside of
10    the ROI cut-off line).
11    Figure 1C shows ROI vertices for each of the cortical thickness groups (A-D) by
12    colored points on the white cortex, at which the thickness of the cortex is either thicker
13    or thinner particularly for one cohort compared with that of two other cohorts. These
14    ROI vertices are widely distributed on the cortex, and their locations are not fixed but
15    vary depending on the groups A to D. We uncovered, however, that the medial
16    temporal lobe, known to be very important for memory formation, is always indicated
17    by a red or dark red color irrespective of the groups A to D (Figure S2). This implies
18    that the cortical thickness values of the medial temporal lobe for subjects with AD are
19    characteristically thinner than those of CN subjects or individuals with MCI (red color),
20    and this decrease occurs in the following descending order: CN-MCI- AD (dark red

 2        cortical thickness of subjects from the ADNI. (A) The distribution of average cortical
 3        thickness of subjects in the CN (black), MCI (cyan), and AD (magenta) cohorts. Above
 4        arrows point to the range of average cortical thickness. Subject number, sex, and age for
 5        each group are listed in Table 1. (B) For the cortical thickness group D, the degree of
 6        separation of the distribution curve of average cortical thickness between CN subjects and
 7        AD subjects is presented in the form of black points. The closer to the origin point (0, 0) the
 8        degree of separation of two distribution curves of average cortical thickness is, the less
 9        distinguishable they are (Figure S1). Black points residing outside of the blue-dashed line
10        (Z = ±1.5) are ROI vertices, and black points residing outside of red-dashed line (Z values
11        are listed in Table S1) are essential ROI vertices. (C) For each group of average cortical
12        thickness, ROI vertices at which the thickness of the cortex for CN subjects is thicker
13        (thinner) than that of the other subjects with MCI or AD is represented by cyan (blue) color.
14        As a similar procedure, ROI vertices for MCI subjects is thicker (thinner) than the other
15        cohorts is represented by green (dark green) color. Also, ROI vertices for AD subjects is
16        thicker (thinner) than the other cohorts is represented by orange (red) color. Especially, the
17        ROI vertices at which the cortical thickness decreases in the descending order of CN-MCI-
18        AD is represented by dark red. And the essential ROI vertices are represented by a black
19        color. The ROI vertices commonly found from more than three groups of average cortical
20        thickness are presented in Figure S2.

22    Character of statistical score matrix and classification of subject’s cohort
23    The section 2.3 described the detailed procedure of constructing the statistical score
24    matrix for determining a subject’s cohort within each group of the average cortical
25    thickness (Figure 2A). In order to judge how well the statistical score matrix
26    distinguishes CN, MCI, and AD cohorts from each other before we predict the cohort

 1    of a new subject, we performed the singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis on
 2    the combined statistical score matrix S(All) which consists of matrix elements of S(CN),
 3    S(MCI), and S(AD). We used the SVD character of a matrix that a given matrix can be
 4    reconstructed as a linear combination of the products of two singular vectors by one
 5    singular matrix. Since the reconstructed matrix from the few highest modes of singular
 6    values contains the predominant character of an original given matrix, one expects
 7    that the differences among the cohorts should appear in singular vectors of different
 8    cohorts. Otherwise, the statistical score matrix S(All) is not reliable nor does it contain
 9    the characteristic ingredient of different cohorts. Figure 2B, 2C and S3 show the
10    highest six singular vectors corresponding to the six largest singular values from SVD
11    analysis of the statistical score matrices for each group of the average cortical
12    thickness A to D. Here, it demonstrates that elements in the singular vectors v1 to v3
13    for CN, MCI, and AD follow qualitatively a similar trend, meaning that these compose
14    the fundamental default modes, whereas those in v4 to v5 follow a different trend and
15    are distinguished each other.

 2        process starting from the cortical thickness matrix at all 276,825 vertices to that at only 564
 3        essential ROI vertices, and then construction of the score matrix. The dimension in the x-
 4        axis of the cortical thickness matrix at all 276,825 is too large to draw, we placed the blank
 5        in the middle to abbreviate the large dimension of the x-axis. (B) The results of singular
 6        value decomposition analysis on score matrices, which are composed of 547 CN, 722 MCI,
 7        247 AD human brain images and used for self-recognition test. For each group of average
 8        cortical thickness, six singular vectors corresponding to the six largest singular values are
 9        presented. Here, x-axis is m value defined in the section 2.3, and y-axis is an arbitrary unit
10        for the singular vectors. For each graph, the singular vector components for CN, MCI, and
11        AD subjects are plotted by black, cyan, magenta colors, respectively. (C) The results of
12        singular value decomposition analysis on score matrices, which are composed of 363 CN,
13        480 MCI, 163 AD human brain images as a training set and used for the first iteration of
14        the stratified 3-fold cross validation test. The other results of that used for the second and
15        third iterations of the stratified 3-fold cross validation test are presented in Figure S3.

17    Out of 547 CN, 722 MCI, and 247 AD human brain images predetermined clinically
18    and provided from the ADNI data set, we performed the self-recognition test and the
19    stratified 3-fold cross validation test using the 1516 human brain images for each
20    group on the average cortical thickness A to D (Table 2). For the first (second; third)
21    iteration of stratified 3-fold cross validation test, 1006 (1011; 1015) human brain
22    images were used as the training set for learning the statistical score matrix and 510
23    (505; 501) human brain images were used as an independent validation set. The new
24    method presented in this study recognized and predicted the subjects with AD in the
25    cohort with more than 91% (self-recognition test) and 82% (stratified 3-fold cross
26    validation test) accuracy, respectively.

 1    than 80% accuracy that they belong to the AD cohort. Thus, we extracted the cortical
 2    thickness profile (or vector) at essential ROI vertices for all brain images, and
 3    constructed the covariance correlation matrix between them. Then we compared the
 4    profile for a given subject’s image with that of patients with AD, to estimate the severity
 5    degree of AD for a given subject towards patients with AD (for the detailed method,
 6    see the section 2.4 and Figure 3A). The personalized quantitative severity degree of
 7    dementia (see the equation (8)) is plotted at the right-bottom graph of Fig. 3A for each
 8    subject of CN, MCI, AD cohort of the group D in the ascending order. The values of
 9    severity degree of dementia were distributed around the averaged value of 0 (ranging
10    from about -0.5 to +0.5) for subjects with CN, 0.5 (ranging from about -0.2 to +1.2) for
11    subjects with MCI, and 1.0 (ranging from about +0.2 to +1.5) for subjects with AD,
12    respectively. The distribution of the severity degree for subjects with MCI was laid
13    across both ranges of those for CN and AD, which points out that this is the intrinsic
14    source of the low success ratio in determining the dementia cohort of subjects with
15    MCI. One could sort out quantitatively the broad spectrum of the severity of dementia
16    for MCI subjects in that whether they are prone to CN or how much they are
17    progressed toward AD. Given a new person for diagnosing the dementia state, one of
18    the cohort CN, MCI, AD was assigned by the equation (3) and the personalized
19    quantitative severity degree of dementia was estimated by the equation (8). Then, with
20    these two-qualitative and quantitative-determinants, one may infer that a new person
21    with the estimated severity degree below 0.0 is most likely to be CN, with that between
22    0.0 and 0.5 might be CN or MCI prone to CN, with that between 0.5 and 1.0 might be
23    MCI prone to AD or AD, and with that above 1.0 is most likely to be AD state.
24    We constructed the covariance correlation matrices for all groups A, B, C, D of the
25    average cortical thickness and observed the common pattern in the matrices that

 2    clustered at the top-right (bottom-left) corner, represented by the cluster of red colors

 4    severity degree of AD and the results to which one of the CN, MCI, AD cohorts each
 5    human brain would belong, based on both the clinical test and our stratified 3-fold
 6    cross validation test (Figure 3B). After comparing the result from our independent
 7    validation test with that of the clinical test, we noted that those subjects which were
 8    predicted to belong to the MCI cohort by the clinical test and yet estimated to have the
 9    higher (lower) severity degree of AD by our estimation, were predicted to belong to the
10    AD (CN) cohort from the our validation test.

 1    Discussion
 2    Based on the cortical thickness data of 1516 human brain images from the ADNI data
 3    set, we presented a new algebraic approach for both (1) the identification of the cohort
 4    (CN, MCI, AD) a given subject would belong to and (2) the quantitative estimation of
 5    the severity degree of AD for a given new person (Figure 4). A total of 1516 human
 6    brain MR images were partitioned into four groups by the average cortical thickness
 7    of each subject. Out of 327,684 vertices on the cortex, a few hundred essential ROI
 8    vertices for each group were identified, which were enough to distinguish the cortical
 9    thickness distribution of the CN, MCI, and AD cohorts from each other. Statistical score
10    matrices using the cortical thickness on the essential ROI vertices were constructed
11    as a classifier for determining the cohort of a given subject. Out of 547 CN, 722 MCI,
12    and 247 AD subjects predetermined clinically, the success ratio for recognizing their
13    cohort was 92% with CN, 69% with MCI, and 91% with AD subjects. On the other hand,
14    the stratified 3-fold cross-validation test gave the correct prediction rate of 84% with
15    CN, 59% with MCI, and 82% in subjects with AD; this is in agreement with the results
16    of clinical determination. Using the quantitative severity degree of AD for subjects, we
17    could explain the reason why the inevitable uncertainty in the determination of the MCI
18    cohort arouse by the very broad distribution of the severity degree of dementia which
19    MCI subjects possess intrinsically. We suggested that the severity degree of AD
20    presented in this study would be a realistic measure for the quantitative personalized
21    diagnosis of a given subject instead of tri-partitioning the classification of a subject’s
22    cohort only by CN, MCI or AD. It is the continuous degree for a given subject along
23    the scale from 0 for the basin of CN state to 1 for the basin of AD state. One could sort
24    out quantitatively the broad spectrum of the severity degree of dementia for MCI or AD
25    subjects with the different severity degree of dementia in that whether they are prone
                                                                     23

1    to CN or how much they are progressed toward AD. This study not only provided a
2    straightforward algebraic approach to analyzing the cortical thicknesses of human
3    brains but also suggested quantitative measures by which one could estimate both the
4    cohort and the severity degree of AD for a given new subject based on the neuro-
5    images from the structural MRI. The MRI data of a larger number of human brains
6    could also be implemented into this study in a systematic and robust manner, which
7    would facilitate the better diagnose of AD with the different degree of dementia.

 2        Supplementary Figure 3. The character of score matrix for each group of average
 3        cortical thickness. (A) The results of singular value decomposition analysis on score
 4        matrices, which are composed of 365 CN, 481 MCI, 165 AD human brain images as a
 5        training set and used for the second iteration of stratified 3-fold cross validation test. And
 6        (C) the results of that which are composed of 366 CN, 483 MCI, 166 AD human brain
 7        images as a training set and used for the third iteration of stratified 3-fold cross validation
 8        test. For each group of average cortical thickness, six singular vectors corresponding to the
 9        six largest singular values are presented. Here, x-axis is m value defined in the section 2.3,
10        and y-axis is an arbitrary unit for the singular vectors. For each graph, the singular vector
11        components for CN, MCI, and AD subjects are plotted by black, cyan, magenta colors,
12        respectively.
