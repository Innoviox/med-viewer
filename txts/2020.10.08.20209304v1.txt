 1      Abstract
 2      Background
 3      People with active cancer are recognised as at risk of COVID-19 complications, but it
 4      is unclear whether the much larger population of cancer survivors is at elevated risk.
 5      We aimed to address this by comparing cancer survivors and cancer-free controls for
 6      (i) prevalence of comorbidities considered risk factors for COVID-19; and (ii) risk of
 7      severe influenza, as a marker of susceptibility to severe outcomes from epidemic
 8      respiratory viruses.
 9      Methods
10      We included survivors (≥1 year) of the 20 most common cancers, and age, sex and
11      general practice-matched cancer-free controls, derived from UK primary care data
12      linked to cancer registrations, hospital admissions and death registrations. Comorbidity
13      prevalences were calculated 1 and 5 years from cancer diagnosis. Risk of
14      hospitalisation or death due to influenza was compared using Cox models adjusted for
15      baseline demographics and comorbidities.
16      Findings
17      108,215 cancer survivors and 523,541 cancer-free controls were included. Cancer
18      survivors had more asthma, other respiratory, cardiac, diabetes, neurological, renal,
19      and liver disease, and less obesity, compared with controls, but there was variation by
20      cancer site. There were 205 influenza hospitalisations/deaths, with cancer survivors at
21      higher risk than controls (adjusted HR 2.78, 95% CI 2.04-3.80). Haematological cancer
22      survivors had large elevated risks persisting for >10 years (HR overall 15.17, 7.84-
23      29.35; HR >10 years from cancer diagnosis 10.06, 2.47-40.93). Survivors of other
24      cancers had evidence of raised risk up to 5 years from cancer diagnosis only (HR 2.22,
25      1.31-3.74).
26      Interpretation
27      Risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes are likely to be elevated in cancer survivors. This
28      should be taken into account in policies targeted at clinical risk groups, and vaccination
29      for both influenza, and, when available, COVID-19, should be encouraged in cancer
30      survivors.

 3      Evidence before this study
 4      Few data are available to date on how COVID-19 affects cancer survivors. We
 5      searched PubMed with the keywords “influenza cancer survivors” to identify studies
 6      that compared severe influenza outcomes in cancer survivors and in a control group.
 7      No study was identified.
 8
 9      Added value of this study
10      In this matched cohort study of routinely collected electronic health records, we
11      demonstrated raised risks of influenza hospitalisation or mortality in survivors from
12      haematological malignancies for >10 years after diagnosis, and in survivors from
13      solid cancers up to 5 years after diagnosis.
14
15      Implications of all the available evidence
16      Cancer survivorship appears to be an important risk factor for severe influenza
17      outcomes, suggesting that cancer survivors may also be at raised risk of poor
18      COVID-19 outcomes. This should be taken into account in public health policies
19      targeted at protecting clinical risk groups. Influenza vaccination should be
20      encouraged in this group, and may need to be extended to a wider population of
21      medium- to long-term cancer survivors than currently recommended.

 1      Introduction
 2      As of 7 July 2020, the novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been
 3      diagnosed in over 11.6 million individuals with more than 539,000 deaths reported
 4      worldwide.1 Around 20% of individuals contracting the virus are estimated to develop
 5      severe disease requiring hospitalisation, with a high risk of mortality.2 A key aspect of
 6      managing the impacts of the pandemic is understanding who is vulnerable to
 7      experiencing severe outcomes, so that mitigation strategies can be targeted at those
 8      most in need. Those under current treatment for cancer were recognised early on as
 9      being a high risk group,3 but the extent to which the much larger population of medium-
10      to long-term cancer survivors, might be considered vulnerable is unknown. In England
11      alone, this group includes over 1.8 million people.4
12      Current guidance on who should be considered vulnerable has been largely based on
13      policies developed for previous epidemic respiratory viruses, notably influenza. For
14      example, vaccination against influenza is only recommend for individuals under active
15      treatment for cancer and for up two years following some treatments and
16      haematological cancers,5 while longer-term cancer survivors with no recent
17      immunosuppressing treatment are not considered high-risk in vaccination guidance
18      from Public Health England or the American Cancer Society.5,6 Yet medium- to long-
19      term cancer survivors could plausibly be at raised risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes.
20      Studies among women with breast cancer have found chemotherapy to be associated
21      with changes in immune parameters that did not return to pre-treatment levels a year
22      or more after end of treatment, raising the possibility of a long-term weakened immune
23      system in cancer survivors.7,8 In addition, cancer survivors have known raised risks of
24      heart disease,9 which is itself an emerging risk factor for COVID-19 mortality.10 One
25      large UK study identified raised risks of COVID-19 mortality in survivors of
26      haematological malignancies even several years after cancer diagnosis,11 but there is
27      little other evidence to date to inform policy around managing COVID-19 related risks
28      in cancer survivors.
29      We therefore aimed to investigate whether cancer survivors are likely to be a high-risk
30      group for severe outcomes during the current COVID-19 pandemic in two ways: first,
31      by comparing the prevalence of risk factors currently used to guide COVID-19 policy
32      between site-specific cancers survivors and cancer free controls; second, by
33      comparing the risk of influenza hospitalisation or death between cancer survivors and
34      cancer free controls, as a way of exploring susceptibility to severe outcomes from
35      epidemic respiratory viruses.

 3      Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline (S1 Checklist).

 5      Study design and data sources
 6      We carried out a population-based cohort study among 1-year survivors of the 20 most
 7      common site-specific cancers matched to cancer-free controls. We used primary care
 8      data from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD GOLD)12 linked to national data
 9      on hospital admissions from the Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care
10      (HES APC) database,13 cancer registrations from the National Cancer Registration and
11      Analysis Service (NCRAS),14 death registrations – including cause of death information
12      – from the Office of National Statistics mortality database, and postcode-based index
13      of Multiple Deprivation data.9 CPRD GOLD comprises routinely collected clinical and
14      administrative data from general practices in the UK that use Vision software and have
15      chosen to participate; approximately 7% of the UK population is included. Data include
16      Read-coded diagnoses and care events, drug prescriptions, numerical measurements
17      (e.g., height and weight), laboratory test results (e.g. serum creatinine) and health risk
18      factors (e.g. smoking status). Secondary care diagnoses reported to the general
19      practitioner (GP) through discharge letters are typically recorded in the general
20      practice record if they are considered to affect the ongoing care of the patient. Linked
21      International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD-10) coded HES APC and
22      NCRAS data improve ascertainment of diseases treated in secondary care.9 Use of
23      linked data restricted our study to England and the study period covered by all linked
24      data sources, January 1 1990 to December 31 2015.
25
26      Study population
27      Cohorts of adult cancer survivors (aged ≥18 years) were identified for each of the 20
28      most common cancer sites (listed in Table 1), as in a previous study.9 Briefly, we used
29      CPRD GOLD, HES APC, and NCRAS to identify 1-year survivors of incident cancer
30      diagnoses. Incident diagnoses were defined as the earliest record of a malignant
31      cancer of interest among individuals with at least 1 year of follow-up meeting CPRD
32      internal quality control criteria prior to the diagnosis (to ensure that the cancer was
33      incident). The derivation of the final analysis cohort is described in Supplementary
34      Figure S1. Cancer survivors with missing data on smoking (5.5%), body mass index
35      (13.0%), or index of multiple deprivation (an area-based proxy for socioeconomic
36      status derived from the patient’s postcode; <0.1%) were excluded from the cohorts.
                                                                                                                          5

 1      Older records were more likely to be excluded, as completeness of lifestyle information
 2      improved when the Quality and Outcomes Framework was introduced in 2004.12
 3      Cancer survivors were followed up from 1 year after diagnosis (index date) and
 4      matched on age (±3 years), sex, and general practice to 5 controls with no history of
 5      cancer and at least 2 years of follow-up prior to the index date of the matched cancer
 6      survivor (since cancer survivors had to have one year of follow-up before and after the
 7      date of cancer diagnosis to be included). Cancer survivors were eligible to be selected
 8      as controls until the date of the incident cancer.
 9
10      Outcome and covariates
11      The main outcome for the study was influenza hospitalisation or death, identified using
12      ICD-10 codes in HES and ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes in ONS mortality data (codes
13      available in Supplementary Table S1). For the primary analysis, we counted
14      hospitalisations with a primary diagnosis of influenza, and deaths with an underlying
15      cause of influenza. In a sensitivity analysis, we broadened the definition to include
16      hospitalisations/deaths with any code for influenza present.
17      Age and sex were matching factors. Other covariates were index of multiple
18      deprivation quintile, smoking status (never, former, current smoker), and common
19      comorbidities identified a priori as of potential importance in determining risk of severe
20      COVID-19 outcomes, namely asthma, chronic respiratory disease other than asthma,
21      chronic heart disease, chronic liver disease, chronic neurological disease, chronic
22      kidney disease, diabetes, obesity, sickle cell disease or splenectomy. Other causes of
23      immunosuppression were not included due to overlap with cancer and its treatment. In
24      a secondary analysis we also described the total number of comorbidities (0 vs 1 vs
25      ≥2 comorbidities from the aforementioned list). Full variable definitions and code lists
26      are provided in Supplementary Table S1.
27
28      Statistical analysis
29      Prevalence of COVID-19 related risk factors in cancer survivors and controls: Among
30      cancer survivors and controls alive and under follow-up in CPRD GOLD at the index
31      date (i.e. 1 year after cancer diagnosis for cancer survivors) and 4 years later (5 years
32      after diagnosis), we calculated the proportion with each morbidity of interest for all
33      cancers combined and individual cancer sites. The numerator included those with any
34      history of the relevant comorbidity at the given time point, except for obesity, which
35      was classified based on the most recent body mass index (BMI) measure available at
36      that time point.
                                                                                                                          6

 1      Risk of influenza hospitalisation and mortality in cancer survivors and controls:
 2      Individuals were followed up from the index date until the earliest occurrence of the
 3      outcome, death without the outcome, or end of study period. Follow-up was not
 4      censored at the end of data collection in CPRD GOLD because the main analysis did
 5      not require post-baseline primary care data. We then fitted Cox proportional hazards
 6      models with time since index date as the timescale, initially accounting only for
 7      matching factors (i.e. age at index date, sex, and general practice) through stratification
 8      by matched set and then additionally adjusting for the presence of risk factors at the
 9      index date (for this analysis obesity was classified at the cancer diagnosis date since
10      weight measures in the year following cancer diagnosis may be unstable). We
11      examined the role of time since cancer diagnosis, by fitting a time-updated variable
12      indicating time of cancer survivorship (1 to <5, 5 to <10, and ≥10 years since diagnosis,
13      vs control group patient).
14      Since haematological malignancies directly affect the immune system and treatments
15      may have long-term immune consequences, we stratified results by haematological
16      versus other cancers by fitting a three-level cancer survivorship variable. Due to limited
17      power, we did not break cancer sites down further. In a post hoc analysis, the exposure
18      variable included each haematological malignancy separately (leukaemia, non-
19      Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma) and four groups of solid cancers (i.e. breast,
20      gastrointestinal, genitourinary, others); Wald tests were used after model estimation to
21      test the null hypothesis of heterogeneity of effect among subgroups.
22      As a secondary analysis, we explored mediation of any raised risk of the primary
23      outcome by development of recognised risk factors during follow-up, by adjusting for
24      time-updated risk factor variables (taking the value “0” until the risk factor is first
25      present, and “1” afterwards). This analysis was additionally censored at the end of
26      follow-up in CPRD GOLD, since it relies on post-baseline primary care data.
27      Patients with missing data on BMI, smoking or deprivation were excluded from the
28      cohorts (see above), therefore all models were based on complete case analyses.
29      Multiple imputation was not used, as the missingness was considered likely to be not
30      at random in the primary care setting 15,16, and complete case analysis minimises bias
31      in this situation, providing missingness is conditionally independent of the outcome
32      17
          .Sensitivity analyses: We conducted two main sensitivity analyses. First, we
33      broadened our definition of the outcome to include influenza recorded anywhere in the
34      hospitalisation or death record, to account for the possibility of differential prioritisation
35      of influenza codes between cancer survivors and controls. Second, we adjusted for
36      time-updated influenza vaccination status and ever receipt of a pneumococcal vaccine,
37      as cancer survivors may be more likely to receive influenza and pneumococcal
38      vaccinations than general population controls due to higher engagement with
                                                                                                                          7

 4      the date of vaccination until the start of the following influenza season in September.
 5      As vaccination records were ascertained from primary care data, these analyses were
 6      additionally censored at the end of CPRD follow up; we also re-ran the primary model

 1      Results
 2      This study included 108,215 cancer survivors, of which 9,685 had prior haematological
 3      malignancies, and 523,541 individuals with no history of cancer (Table 1). Median
 4      (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 67 (58, 76) in the cancer survivor and comparison
 5      group; 6,674 (52.4%) and 277,781 (53.1%) of subjects were female, respectively.
 6      Prevalence of COVID-19 related risk factors in cancer survivors and controls
 7      For all cancers combined, we observed higher absolute prevalence of all risk factors
 8      for severe COVID-19 except for obesity and sickle cell disease/splenectomy in 1-year
 9      cancer survivors, compared to the cancer-free comparison group (Figure 1, sickle
10      cell/splenectomy not shown as the prevalence was <0.2% in all groups). At 5-years
11      after diagnosis, cancer survivors overall had slightly higher prevalence of all risk factors
12      except heart disease and neurological conditions (differences in prevalences ranging
13      from 0.3% for diabetes and chronic liver disease, to 1.8% for chronic kidney disease).
14      Survivors of most site-specific cancers also had raised prevalences of these risk
15      factors, with the magnitude varying by cancer site. The prevalence of obesity was lower
16      in cancer survivors than controls for several cancer sites, but was substantially more
17      common in survivors of uterus and kidney cancers (prevalence difference at 5 years
18      20.1% [95%CI 19.8-20.5], and 8.5% [95%CI 8.1-8.8], respectively). Overall, 62.7% of
19      the cancer survivors had at least 1 of the included comorbidities 5 years after
20      diagnosis, while 37.3% had two or more (Supplementary Table S2). Comorbidity
21      prevalences stratified by age and sex are provided in Supplementary Figure S2(a)-(h).
22      Risk of influenza hospitalisation and mortality in cancer survivors and controls
23      205 people had the primary outcome (190 hospitalisations, 15 deaths) during a median
24      follow-up time from the index date of 4.7 years in cancer survivors (IQR 1.9-8.4 years)
25      and 6.2 years in controls (IQR 3.3-9.9 years); follow-up exceeded 10 years for 19,273
26      (18%) cancer survivors and 128,132 (25%) controls. The risk of influenza
27      hospitalization or death was 2.7 times higher (95%CI 2.12-3.44) in cancer survivors
28      compared to people with no history of cancer after accounting for matching factors only
29      (Table 2). Control for other covariates had little impact on the relative risk estimate
30      (adjusted HR=2.78; 95%CI 2.04-3.80).
31      Stratification by cancer group (haematological vs non-haematological) showed
32      substantial differences. Haematological cancer survivors had 15 times higher risk of a
33      severe influenza outcome compared to people without cancer (adjusted HR 15.17;
34      95%CI 7.84-29.35), and further stratifying by time since cancer diagnosis, the hazard
35      ratio was 29.56 (95%CI 10.20-85.66) for those 1 to <5 years from diagnosis, falling to
36      9.56 (95%CI 4.39-20.84) and 10.06 (95%CI 2.47-40.93) for those 5 to <10, and 10+
                                                                                                                          9

 1      years from diagnosis respectively. Associations were smaller for non-haematological
 2      cancer survivors. The overall adjusted HR was 1.38 but compatible with chance
 3      variation (95%CI 0.92-2.07). However, stratification by time since diagnosis suggested
 4      a doubling of risk in those 1 to <5 years from diagnosis (adjusted HR 2.22, 1.31-3.74)
 5      with no raised risk in longer-term survivors.
 6
 7      Sensitivity, mediation and post-hoc analyses
 8      Using hospitalisations and deaths with any mention of influenza in the outcome
 9      definition led to more events being included (n=320) but a very similar pattern of results
10      to the primary analysis (Supplementary Table S3). In analyses that censored at end of
11      CPRD follow-up, fewer events were included (n=167) but hazard ratios were generally
12      larger than in the primary analysis (overall adjusted HR for cancer survivors vs controls
13      3.88, 2.54-5.91, Supplementary Table S4). Additional control for time-updated
14      exposure to influenza and pneumococcal vaccination led to similar but slightly stronger
15      associations (overall HR 4.06, 2.65-6.24), while adjusting for mediators led to slightly
16      weaker associations (overall HR 3.27, 95%CI 2.12-5.04), but in both cases patterns of
17      results were similar. There was no strong statistical evidence of a variation in the HRs
18      among survivors of leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma
19      (p=0.08), or among survivors from the different solid cancers (p=0.42).

 1      Discussion
 2      Most comorbidities thought to be risk factors for COVID-19 were more prevalent in
 3      cancer survivors than cancer-free controls, with variation by cancer site. After
 4      accounting for baseline demographics, deprivation, smoking and risk factors
 5      distribution, the risks of influenza hospitalisation and death were elevated >9-fold in
 6      haematological cancer survivors compared with matched controls for at least 10 years
 7      after diagnosis, and >2-fold in non-haematological cancer survivors in the one to five
 8      years after diagnosis.
 9      To our knowledge, this is the first large cohort study using prospectively collected data
10      to quantify the relative risk of severe influenza outcomes in different groups of cancer
11      survivors compared to the general population, including stratification by time since
12      diagnosis. The few previous studies in this area have reported high rates of influenza
13      among cancer survivors, consistent with our findings, but have lacked a cancer-free
14      comparison group.18-21 Hermann et al. investigated outcomes among patients with a
15      history of cancer presenting with influenza, and found no difference in mortality
16      according to haematological or non-haematological cancer type, or activity of the
17      cancer.18 Our results showed considerably higher risks of hospitalisation or death
18      among haematological cancer survivors, which could be consistent with the findings in
19      Hermann et al. if haematological cancer survivors are at increased risk of infection, but
20      not mortality once infected, compared to non-haematological cancer survivors. Other
21      studies have investigated vulnerability to influenza infection of any severity; two studies
22      using administrative claims data in South Korea found a high rate of claims for
23      influenza among both breast cancer survivors and survivors of childhood cancers.19,20
24      Similarly, Australian survey data found that a large proportion (38%) of hematopoietic
25      stem cell transplant survivors had had influenza-like illnesses in the time (median 5
26      years) since their transplant suggesting potentially high vulnerability to infection, but
27      there was no control group or information on severity of infection.21
28      Direct evidence on how COVID-19 affects cancer patients and survivors is immature.
29      Early evidence from China and Italy suggested that patients with history of cancer were
30      overrepresented among those admitted to hospital with COVID-19.22,23 The large UK
31      OpenSAFELY study found substantially raised risks of COVID-19 mortality among
32      individuals with prior haematological cancer persisting for at least 5 years from cancer
33      diagnosis, and smaller raised risks for those with a history of non-haematological
34      cancers up to 5 years from diagnosis, consistent with our findings for influenza.11 A
35      study from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) reported high 30-day
36      mortality among individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and active or
                                                                                                                       11

 1      previous malignancy, finding high 30-day mortality, even among those in remission,
 2      though active disease was a strong predictor of mortality.24 Finally, a study that
 3      focussed on patients with active cancer and COVID-19 found a non-statistically
 4      significant increased risk of mortality in patients exposed to chemotherapy 4 weeks
 5      prior to infection (OR=1.18, 95%CI 0.81-1.72), compared to cancer patients that did
 6      not receive chemotherapy, but the small numbers involved require further studies to
 7      confirm these associations.25
 8      We used a large cohort of cancer survivors and matched controls, nearly a quarter of
 9      whom were followed up for more than 10 years. The size of our study enabled us to
10      estimate prevalence of risk factors for severe respiratory infections in site-specific
11      cancer survivors for the twenty most common cancer sites with good precision, and to
12      adjust our primary analysis of severe influenza outcomes for multiple risk factors and
13      stratify by type of cancer (haematological vs other). Multiple validation studies have
14      demonstrated the validity of CPRD primary care data for measuring disease
15      phenotypes including cancer, especially when combined with additional linked data
16      sources.26 Our primary analysis was designed to be specific to hospitalisations and
17      deaths caused by influenza, and a broader definition in sensitivity analysis found
18      similar results. A second sensitivity analysis took account of time-updated vaccination
19      status, which showed that the associations we observed persisted, and in fact were
20      stronger after accounting for this apparent negative confounder.
21      There are some important limitations. We analysed severe influenza in an attempt to
22      inform COVID-19 policy but despite both being infectious respiratory illnesses, it is not
23      certain that risk factors for severe influenza will have the same associations with
24      COVID-19. Our approach follows that of policy makers who have assumed parallels
25      with influenza in the absence of mature COVID-19 data.27 As data from the COVID-19
26      pandemic itself have started to flow, they have largely confirmed a broad overlap
27      between those at high risk for seasonal influenza and for severe COVID-19
28      outcomes.11 Another limitation was that we did not have data on anti-cancer
29      treatments, so could not separate cancer survivors into those under active treatment
30      or not undergoing any treatment, which may be an important determinant of risk. We
31      only included cancer survivors at least one year out from diagnosis, so it is likely that
32      most patients with high-grade malignancies would have completed primary treatment,
33      but people with low-grade tumours could conceivably have received anticancer
34      therapies some years after initial diagnosis, which could explain part of the medium-
35      to long-term increased risk of severe influenza; linked cancer treatment data will be
36      needed to investigate this further. We cannot rule out that differences in the prevalence
37      of risk factors between cancer survivors and controls five years post-diagnosis may be
                                                                                                                       12

 1      due to increased contact with health services, particularly for diseases such as chronic
 2      kidney disease which may be asymptomatic. Our primary outcome combined influenza
 3      hospitalisations and deaths but was dominated by the former; it is plausible that there
 4      may be a lower threshold for hospitalisation in cancer survivors which could have
 5      exaggerated the difference in risk of the primary outcome between cancer survivors
 6      and controls, but is unlikely to fully explain the large associations we observed. Finally,
 7      we had some missing data on smoking and BMI data, and we excluded those with
 8      missing data from the analysis; this is unlikely to affect our findings under the
 9      assumption that the association between cancer survivorship and severe respiratory
10      outcomes is the same in people with and without missing data, conditional on the
11      covariates included in the model. We have no reason to doubt this assumption, as
12      recording of BMI and smoking in primary care could be associated with cancer
13      survivorship but most likely is not associated with the risk of influenza hospitalization
14      or death.
15      The high prevalence of several established COVID-19 risk factors in cancer survivors,
16      and the increased risk of influenza hospitalisation and death in survivors of
17      haematological cancers even many years from diagnosis, and in survivors from other
18      cancers in the first five years of survivorship, indicate a likely increased risk of severe
19      COVID-19 outcomes in these patient groups. Early direct evidence from the COVID-
20      19 pandemic appears to be consistent with this. These findings suggest that cancer
21      survivorship should be considered a potentially important risk factor for severe COVID-
22      19 outcomes in public health policy. At present, while UK policy defines those with
23      active cancers and/or receiving treatments as high-risk for COVID-19 complications,
24      the much larger overall population of cancer survivors does not appear in either
25      moderate or high-risk groupings;28 these risk groupings become increasingly important
26      as general population social distancing measures are eased and advice becomes
27      more targeted to those at risk.
28      Our results also have implications for preventive medicine in the coming autumn and
29      winter, when influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are expected to coexist in the population.
30      Improving influenza vaccination coverage among cancer survivors should be a priority,
31      as the vaccine is both effective and safe29,30 but coverage has been reported in the
32      range of 50% to 76% among cancer survivors in the US and in the UK.31,32
33      Immunisation for streptococcus pneumoniae may also be considered.33 Of note, UK
34      influenza vaccine guidance focusses on cancer patients with active or recent disease
35      or treatment;5 our findings suggest that a broader population of cancer survivors should
36      be considered as a high-risk group for influenza vaccination.

 1      Future studies should focus on the risk of severe COVID-19 in cancer survivors,
 2      explore the role of comorbidities and prior exposure to specific anti-cancer therapies,
 3      disaggregating data by cancer site when possible.
 4      In conclusion, survivors of haematological malignancies had substantially elevated
 5      risks of influenza hospitalisation or death persisting for at least 10 years after cancer
 6      diagnosis, while risk was doubled for survivors of other cancers for up to 5 years from
 7      diagnosis. In addition, cancer survivors had higher prevalence of several chronic
 8      conditions associated with severe COVID-19, compared to people with no history of
 9      cancer. This should be taken into account in public health policies targeted at
10      protecting clinical risk groups. Influenza vaccination should be encouraged in this
11      group, and may need to be extended to a wider population of medium- to long-term
12      cancer survivors than currently recommended.
