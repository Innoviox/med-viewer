    Abstract:
    Background
    Polyester nasal swabs stored in saline or in a dry tube were evaluated as an alternative to foam
    nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain
    reaction (RT-qPCR) since they may be inexpensively manufactured at high capacity.
    Methods
    Surrogate clinical specimens were prepared by inoculating foam and polyester nasal swabs with
    residual SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens diluted in porcine or human matrix. Dry swab
    elution with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was evaluated by vortex, swab swirling, and passive
    methodologies. Surrogate and clinical nasal specimen stability were evaluated at refrigerated (4C)
    and elevated temperatures (40C for 12 hours, 32C hold) through 72 hours.
    Results
    Polyester swabs demonstrated equivalent performance to foam swabs for detection of low and high
    SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. Dry swab elution performed with PBS and mechanical disruption by
    vortex resulted in nearly complete quantitative recovery of virus. Dry polyester and foam surrogate
    specimens were stable through 72 hours both when refrigerated and after high temperature
    excursion, which simulated specimen transport without cold chain. Similarly, clinical specimens
    collected with polyester swabs and stored dry were stable through 72 hours in the presence and
    absence of cold chain. Polyester surrogate specimens stored in saline were stable through 72 hours
    refrigerated but only through 48 hours at elevated temperatures.

    Polyester nasal swabs stored in dry collection tubes comprise a robust and inexpensive self-

    Introduction:
    The worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has
    caused unprecedented demand for testing to diagnose patients with coronavirus disease 2019
    (COVID-19). To expand capacity and increase accessibility, nasal (anterior nares, AN) specimens
    were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing and were deemed acceptable by the FDA,
    leading to inclusion in recommendations by both the CDC and the FDA (1, 2). Recent studies
    demonstrated that self-collected AN specimens are equivalent to healthcare-professional collected
    nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-
    polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (2, 3). Nasal swab self-collection is more tolerable and
    reduces patient contact with medical professionals, thereby decreasing the risk of viral
    transmission and preserving PPE supplies.
    In early March of 2020, the initial studies which established the nasal swab collection method
    utilized foam swabs (2, 3). However, supplies quickly became depleted as large diagnostic
    manufacturers, laboratories, and government agencies secured the available supply. To address the
    shortage, additional swab types were evaluated including spun polyester swabs, which can be
    manufactured at higher capacity than foam swabs and are inexpensive to produce. The polyester
    spun swab demonstrated similar performance for nasal specimen collection to the foam swab and
    FDA guidance was updated to include polyester swabs as an acceptable swab type for SARS-CoV-
    2 testing (1, 4).
    Upper respiratory swabs have historically been transferred to the laboratory in viral transport
    media (VTM), however VTM shortages ensued upon the start of the pandemic. Phosphate buffered
    saline (PBS), saline, and other alternative solutions were deemed acceptable by the FDA for swab
    transport (1), with saline demonstrating better performance for use with nasal swabs as compared
                                                                        5

    to VTM (4). While alternate swab transport solutions have alleviated the immediate supply
    shortages, consideration of additional swab transport methods such as dry tube storage prompted
    further investigation.
    In this study, we evaluated the performance and stability of polyester nasal swabs stored in dry
    collection tubes as an alternative specimen collection option for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing.
    Replicate swabs were prepared using residual positive clinical specimens diluted in clinical matrix
    to known concentrations near the limit of detection (LoD). The conclusions of these studies were
    confirmed by the assessment of fresh positive patient specimens collected with polyester nasal
    swabs. We demonstrate that clinical specimens stored dry are stable under conditions required for
    home collection and shipment to the laboratory for testing.
    Materials and Methods:
    SARS-CoV-2 Clinical Specimens
    Residual clinician-collected nasal specimens were collected in sterile saline or VTM and
    refrigerated (UnitedHealth Group protocol #2020-0002, approved by UHG Institutional Review
    Board). All positive specimens were collected from known COVID-19 patients previously tested
    using the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the Emergency
    Use Authorization (EUA) instructions (5).
    Source Materials
    Nasal swabs included: Puritan foam (#25-1506), Fisherbrand polyester-tipped applicator (Fisher
    Scientific, #22-363-170), Copan spun polyester (#164KS01), SteriPack spun polyester #60564
    (also known as US Cotton spun polyester #3), SteriPack spun polyester #60567 (also known as
    US Cotton spun polyester 3ARS), Copan mini FLOQ (#503CS01), and Copan regular FLOQ
                                                                        6

    (#56380CS01). PBS (Sigma) was used for dry swab elution and sterile saline (Kroger) was used
    for swab storage when media was utilized. Porcine mucus (clinical matrix) was obtained from the
    University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Lab and the Iowa State University Veterinary
    Medicine Laboratory.
    Dry Swab Elution
    Dry swab elution was performed by adding 1 mL of PBS to the 15 mL screw top tube, a 30 second
    vortex with intermittent pulsing, and incubation for 10 minutes at room temperature prior to RNA
    extraction.
    RNA Extraction and RT-qPCR
    RNA extraction was performed from 400 µL PBS eluate using the MagMAX™ Viral/Pathogen
    Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher). RT-qPCR was performed on the QuantStudio™ 7
    Flex 96-well Fast (Thermo Fisher) using 5 µL RNA and the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit
    according to the EUA Instructions For Use, 14March2020; Pub. No. MAN0019181 Rev. A.0 (5).
    Raw cycle thresholds were obtained using the QuantStudio™ Real-Time PCR Software v1.3 and
    the following thresholds: 40,000 for ORF1ab, 25,000 for N, and 38,000 for S. Samples with
    indeterminate or spurious amplification signals were designated a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 40
    cycles. For the experiments using human matrix, RNA samples were also tested using the
    TaqMan™ RNase P assay (Fisher Scientific) on the QuantStudio™ Dx Real-Time Instrument.
    Construction of Surrogate Clinical Specimens
    Residual specimens with negative SARS-CoV-2 results were pooled and diluted 1:2 in porcine
    mucus to generate the negative clinical matrix. Twelve high-positive SARS-CoV-2 specimens
    with Ct values < 25 cycles for all three viral target genes (ORF1ab, N, S) were combined to
                                                                        7

    generate a master positive pool and replicates were tested to determine the average Ct values. Ct
    values corresponding to 2x LoD (20 genomic copy equivalents (GCE)/PCR reaction) and 10x LoD
    (100 GCE/PCR reaction) were calculated using the formula 2-ΔCt=F, where ΔCt is the necessary
    Ct adjustment and F is the fold change (6). Using N gene ΔCt calculations, the master positive
    pool was diluted with negative clinical matrix to generate two positive clinical pools; 2x LoD (low-
    positive pool) and 10x LoD (high-positive pool). Ten replicates of the low- and high-positive
    clinical pools were tested to confirm that N gene Ct values were within the expected range (± 20%
    linear fold change). SARS-CoV-2 GCE values for the clinical pools were determined by N gene
    standard curve analysis and digital PCR (Supplemental Data).
    Viral Recovery from Swabs
    Viral recovery from polyester swabs (Copan) was evaluated across a range of viral loads (1x to
    64x LoD) by serial dilution of the master positive specimen pool with negative specimen clinical
    matrix. The viral pools were tested directly (no swab) or spiked onto polyester swabs. To create
    the spiked swabs, polyester swabs were submerged into a 1.5 mL tube containing 40 µL of positive
    pool and abraded against the tube wall five times in each direction to mimic nasal collection or
    until all of the specimen material was absorbed. The inoculated swab was then transferred to a 15
    mL screw cap tube. For the direct viral testing, 40 µL of positive pool was aliquoted into a 15 mL
    screw cap tube. Three replicates were performed for each of the clinical positive pools and
    conditions (+/- swab). All tubes, with or without swabs, were incubated for 30 minutes at room
    temperature followed by dry swab elution with 1 mL PBS for the spiked swab or addition of 1 mL
    PBS directly to the tube (no swab).
    For the evaluation of alternative swab elution methods, paired polyester swabs (SteriPack #60567)
    were collected from the AN of 10 healthy volunteers by an equal loading method with a crossover
                                                                        8

    design (7). Negative specimens were spiked with 40 µL of the low-positive (2x LoD) clinical
    specimen pool and stored at 4C in a dry tube overnight. Swabs were divided into two groups,
    each containing five pairs, and eluted by the addition of 1 mL PBS. Group 1 compared the standard
    vortex method with swab swirling (swirling the swab within the tube for 10 seconds) while group
    2 compared the standard vortex method to passive elution for 1 hour under refrigeration. RNA
    was extracted for SARS-CoV-2 and RNase P testing by RT-PCR.
    Evaluation of Surrogate Specimen Stability (Porcine Matrix)
    A two-arm study (Supplemental Figure 1) was performed to evaluate the stability of surrogate
    clinical specimens prepared using foam (Puritan) and polyester swabs (Fisherbrand) stored in dry
    tubes, as well as polyester swabs (Fisherbrand) stored in a tube containing 1 mL of sterile saline.
    Swabs were stored at 4C (control arm) or at 40C for the initial 12 hours and then held at 32C
    (experimental arm). To create the surrogate clinical specimens, 2x LoD and 10x LoD specimen
    pools were added directly to the swabs through a procedure that mimicked nasal swabbing action.
    Each swab was placed in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 80 µL of the appropriate
    specimen pool, with the tip of each submerged into the mixture and abraded in a circular motion
    against the side of the tube for 30 seconds. Swabs were transferred to 15 mL screw cap tubes
    containing either 1 mL saline or with no addition of media (dry). After inoculation, baseline and
    negative (n=2 per swab type) swabs from the control arm were processed immediately (0 hours).
    Remaining swabs were stored at 4°C or 40°C for the control and experimental arms, respectively.
    After 12 hours at 40°C, experimental swabs were transferred to 32°C. Swab stability was assessed
    at three time points: 1) 24 hours (+ 8 hours), 2) 48 hours (+ 8 hours), and 3) 72 hours (+ 8 hours).
    The additional eight hours were included as a FDA requirement for stability labeling. Swabs were
    retrieved from storage two hours prior to each time point to equilibrate to room temperature.
                                                                        9

    Evaluation of Polyester Swab Clinical Specimen Stability
    Dry swab specimen stability using human matrix was evaluated through 72 hours at 4C and
    through 48 hours at elevated temperatures (40C 12 hours, held at 32C). Healthy volunteers were
    each given one Copan polyester swab and one SteriPack #60564 polyester swab and were
    instructed to collect normal AN clinical matrix onto the swabs to generate roughly equivalent
    replicates as follows: 1) five revolutions of the Copan swab (left nostril), 2) five revolutions of
    the SteriPack #60564 swab (right nostril), 3) five revolutions of the same SteriPack #60564 swab
    (left nostril), and 4) five revolutions of the same Copan swab (right nostril) (7). The swabs were
    collected from volunteers within an eight-hour timeframe and stored overnight in 15 mL screw
    cap tubes at 4°C prior to viral inoculation. Each swab was placed in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube
    containing 40 µL of one SARS-CoV-2 high-positive (10x LoD) patient sample, with the tip
    submerged into the mixture and abraded in a circular motion against the side of the tube for 30
    seconds or until complete absorption. Swabs were transferred to dry 15 mL screw cap tubes.
    Baseline swabs were processed and tested immediately (0 hours), while all remaining swabs were
    stored at 4°C or 40°C for the control and experimental arms, respectively. After 12 hours at 40°C,
    experimental swabs were transferred to 32°C. Specimens were retrieved from storage two hours
    prior to each time point and were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature. Specimen stability
    was assessed at 24 hours (+ 8 hours) and 48 hours (+ 8 hours) in both study arms and at 72 hours
    (+ 8 hours) in the control arm.
    For the evaluation of clinical specimens, paired SteriPack polyester #60564 swabs were collected
    from five SARS-CoV-2 positive and five SARS-CoV-2 negative patients by the same method
    described above. Paired dry swabs were stored at 4°C or 40°C for the control and experimental
    arms, respectively. After 12 hours at 40°C, experimental swabs were transferred to 32°C.
                                                                       10

    Specimens were retrieved from storage two hours prior to each time point and were allowed to
    equilibrate to room temperature. Specimen stability was assessed at 72 hours (+ 8 hours).
    Data Analysis
    Specimen stability at each time point was defined as ≥ 95% agreement with the expected result for
    low-positive samples (2x LoD) and ≥ 100% agreement with the expected results for high-positive
    (10x LoD) and negative control samples. When calculating the differences between Ct values,
    negative ΔCt values indicate a lower Ct and thus higher viral load, while positive ΔCt values
    indicate a higher Ct value and thus lower viral load. All statistical analyses (one-way ANOVA
    and t-test) were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.
    Results:
    Swab Absorption and Elution from Swabs Stored in Dry Format
    Surrogate specimens were prepared by spiking polyester and foam nasal swabs with SARS-CoV-
    2 positive clinical specimen pools using a swab swirling procedure to mimic nasal swabbing.
    Polyester swabs were 150% more absorbent than foam swabs by the swirling method and by
    passive absorption (Table 1). Once prepared, surrogate specimens were stored dry in empty tubes
    and eluted with 1 mL PBS, followed by a 30 second vortex and 10 minute room temperature
    incubation. Specimen recovery from dry swabs was evaluated by comparing Ct values from
    serially diluted surrogate specimens created with polyester swabs to Ct values from serially diluted
    clinical specimen pools tested directly, without absorption and elution from swabs. SARS-CoV-
    2 N gene mean Ct values from swabs and pools were not statistically different from one another
    (p>0.05) for viral loads ranging from 10 to 66,779 GCE/PCR reaction (Figure 1). Mean ΔCt values
                                                                       11

    were < 0.5 cycle indicating that there is nearly complete quantitative absorption and recovery of
    clinical specimens from swabs using the vortex elution method.
    Two additional dry swab elution methodologies, swab swirling within the tube and passive
    recovery, were compared to the vortex method to determine if mechanical disruption is necessary
    for full specimen recovery. Paired polyester swabs collected from healthy volunteers were spiked
    with a low-positive clinical specimen pool (2x LoD) and dry swabs were eluted using the vortex
    and swab swirling methods or the vortex and passive methods. Mean Ct values for the SARS-
    CoV-2 targets (N, ORF1ab, S) and human RNase P were all statistically higher (p<0.05) for
    swirled and passively eluted swabs than the paired vortexed swabs (Figure 2). Mean paired ΔCt
    values ranged from one to three cycles, correlating to a two- to seven-fold reduction in sample
    detection. These results indicate that mechanical disruption by vortex is necessary for full elution
    of viral material from dry swabs.
    Polyester and Foam Swab Surrogate Specimen Stability
    Stability of swabs for RT-qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed with and without cold
    chain storage. Polyester and foam swabs stored dry (“dry polyester” and “dry foam”) and polyester
    swabs stored in saline (“polyester saline”) were prepared using low- or high-positive SARS-CoV-
    2 clinical specimen pools containing 22 and 144 GCE/PCR reaction, respectively. Ct values from
    the three swab types held under refrigerated conditions were not statistically different (p>0.05)
    through 72 hours (Figure 3A). Refrigerated dry polyester, dry foam, and polyester saline low-
    and high-positive specimen replicates had 100% positive agreement, demonstrating stability
    through 72 hours. At elevated temperatures (40C 12 hours, 32C hold), all three swab types had
    100% positive percent agreement for high-positive specimen replicates through 72 hours. Ct
    values for low-positive dry polyester and dry foam swab specimens were not statistically different
                                                                       12

    (p>0.05) through 72 hours, indicating that the two swab types were equivalent (Figure 3B). For
    both, one of 20 low-positive specimen replicates were inconclusive (only N detected) after 72
    hours at elevated temperatures, resulting in 95% positive percent agreement, meeting the study
    acceptance criteria and establishing stability for dry specimens through 72 hours. Stability for
    polyester saline specimens was established through 48 hours at elevated temperatures (100%
    positive agreement), however, Ct values were significantly higher (p<0.05) than dry polyester and
    foam after 48 hours. Seven of 20 low-positive polyester saline replicates were inconclusive (only
    N detected) after 72 hours at elevated temperatures for 65% positive percent agreement; thus,
    stability for polyester saline specimens was established through 48 hours at elevated temperatures
    (100% positive agreement).
    Viral RNA levels were relatively stable for the dry swabs through 72 hours at both temperatures,
    with ΔCt values for N and ORF1ab < 3 cycles (less than 10-fold change in viral RNA levels)
    (Table 2). Polyester swabs in saline were also stable through 72 hours when refrigerated, however
    they were less stable at elevated temperatures and only met the acceptance criteria through 48
    hours. The S gene target demonstrated diminished stability for all three specimen types at elevated
    temperatures and extended time periods when refrigerated, with less relative stability in saline
    versus dry. The detection of only two out of three viral targets were required for a positive SARS-
    CoV-2 result in accordance with the interpretation algorithm, therefore the S gene results did not
    impact the stability claims for the dry polyester and foam swabs. The Ct drift analysis confirmed
    that at elevated temperatures, dry polyester and dry foam specimens are stable through 72 hours
    with ΔCt values < 3 cycles while polyester specimens stored in saline are stable through 48 hours.

    Polyester Swab Human Matrix and Clinical Specimen Stability
    An additional evaluation of dry polyester swab specimen stability was performed using matrix
    from individual human volunteers. Paired Copan and SteriPack #60564 polyester nasal swabs were
    self-collected by healthy adults and inoculated with virus to create high-positive (10x LoD)
    specimens. Consistent with the results obtained with surrogate specimens prepared with porcine
    matrix, in the presence of human matrix, contrived dry polyester swabs were stable for SARS-
    CoV-2 detection through 72 hours refrigerated and through at least 48 hours at elevated
    temperatures (the experiment was only conducted to 48 hours + 8 hours) (Supplemental Table
    1).
    The stability of contrived dry swab specimens was confirmed with clinical specimens collected
    from five SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals and five healthy individuals using paired polyester
    swabs. Paired swabs were stored for 72 hours with one swab refrigerated and the other at elevated
    temperatures. Ct values for the three SARS-CoV-2 targets and RNase P were not statistically
    different (p>0.05) by storage temperature (Figure 4), indicating that dry clinical specimens are
    stable through 72 hours at both refrigerated and elevated temperatures.
    Discussion:
    Self-collected nasal specimens from the AN perform equivalently to nasopharyngeal and
    oropharyngeal specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR (2, 3). In this study, we
    demonstrate that very low viral loads near the assay limit of detection are detectable from nasal
    swab surrogate clinical specimens that are consistent with viral loads through 10 days from the
    start of COVID-19 symptoms (Y-P Tu, personal communication, August 2020). Viral infectivity
    studies conducted by the CDC and other groups have shown that specimens collected from
                                                                       14

    confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients with mild to moderate illness who are not severely
    immunocompromised and who are greater than 9 – 11 days from the start of symptoms do not
    yield culturable virus, thereby supporting the notion that nasal swab specimens are sensitive
    enough for detection of the virus through the infectious phase (8-11). In the present study, we
    demonstrate the performance of AN swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing using surrogate and clinical
    specimens and show that self-collected nasal swab specimens produce sufficient material for
    molecular testing as demonstrated by the reproducible detection of the RNase P human target.
    Importantly, the self-collection instructions for nasal swabbing must be accurately followed to
    ensure a quality specimen for molecular testing (12). In a recent usability study for the
    HealthPulse@home Nasal Specimen Collection Kit, AN specimens were successfully self-
    collected (n=33) as demonstrated by RNase P detection (mean Ct = 26.4) using swabs transported
    dry in the absence of cold chain storage (Audere, personal communication, August 2020). The
    advantages of self-collected swabs from the AN, whether collected at home or in a healthcare
    setting, include improved patient tolerance, reduction of healthcare worker risk of infection, and
    preservation of PPE. It is anticipated that compliance with COVID-19 testing recommendations
    will increase with the use of a well-tolerated and simple collection device and will enable serial
    testing when appropriate.
    In the present study, we demonstrated that polyester swabs from multiple manufacturers are a
    suitable alternative to foam swabs for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated the
    performance of polyester and foam nasal swabs stored in the absence of any transport media within
    a dry tube and developed a dry swab elution method utilizing PBS and a brief vortex, which can
    be easily performed in the laboratory. Mechanical disruption by vortex resulted in nearly
    quantitative recovery of virus from dry swabs even at very low virus levels, while passive elution
                                                                       15

    and swab swirling showed a marked reduction in viral recovery (although this may be sufficient
    in certain settings). We show that foam and polyester nasal swab specimens may be stored dry
    without transport media for up to 72 hours in the absence of cold chain. Polyester swabs stored in
    saline in the absence of cold chain were stable through 48 hours, however there was reduced
    stability of the low-positive (2x LoD) SARS-CoV-2 samples at 72 hours. Note that buffered saline,
    such as PBS, may support extended stability beyond 48 hours.
    The use of pre-positioned nasal swab collection kits in the home or workplace could facilitate more
    rapid COVID-19 testing and reduction in transmission. Differential diagnosis of other upper
    respiratory infections including influenza, which is also detectable in nasal specimens (13), would
    be feasible from a self-collected specimen. The nasal swab specimens can be stably transported in
    dry tubes within 72 hours to the laboratory where they can be eluted using a robust and
    reproducible elution method. Studies to evaluate reduced elution volumes for increased assay
    sensitivity or direct swab elution into extraction or PCR buffer are under way. The utility of dry
    swabs can also be extended to future applications, including direct antigen testing for SARS-CoV-
    2. It is hoped that the inexpensive polyester nasal swab will bolster testing capabilities to improve
    patient outcomes specifically in low resource settings where swabs and other testing components
    are in limited supply.

    Figure 3. Quantitative measurement of nasal swab specimen stability. Dry polyester (blue), dry
    foam (red), and polyester swabs stored in saline (gray) were stored refrigerated (A, 4C) or at
    elevated temperatures (B, 40C 12 hours, 32C) through 72 hours. No PCR amplification was
    assigned a Ct value of 40. *statistically different, p<0.05.
