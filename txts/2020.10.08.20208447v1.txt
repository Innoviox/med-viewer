    Abstract
    Background
    The number of patients with coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has amplified in India.
    Understanding the district level correlates of the COVID-19 infection ratio (IR) is therefore
    essential for formulating policies and intervention.
    Objectives
    The present study examines the association between socio-economic and demographic
    characteristics of India’s population and the COVID-19 infection ratio at district level...
    Data and Methods
    Using crowdsourced data on the COVID-19 prevalence rate, we analyzed state and district level
    variation in India from March 14 to July 31 2020. We identified hotspot and cold spot districts
    for COVID-19 cases and infection ratio. We have also carried out a regression analysis to
    highlight the district level demographic, socio-economic, infrastructure, and health-related
    correlates of the COVID-19 infection ratio.
    Results
    The results showed that the IR is 42.38 per one hundred thousand population in India. The
    highest IR was observed in Andhra Pradesh (145.0), followed by Maharashtra (123.6), and was

    the lowest in Chhattisgarh (10.1). About 80 per cent of infected cases, and 90 per cent of deaths
    were observed in nine Indian states (Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka,
    Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Gujarat). Moreover, we observed COVID-
    19 cold-spots in central, northern, western, and north-eastern regions of India. Out of 736
    districts, six metropolitan cities (Mumbai, Chennai, Thane, Pune, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad)
    emerged as the major hotspots in India, containing around 30 per cent of confirmed total
    COVID-19 cases in the country. Simultaneously, parts of the Konkan coast in Maharashtra, parts
    of Delhi, the southern part of Tamil Nadu, the northern part of Jammu & Kashmir were
    identified as hotspots of COVID-19 infection. Moran's- I value of 0.333showed a positive spatial
    clusteringlevel in the COVID-19 IR case over neighboring districts. Our regression analysis
    found that district-level population density (β: 0.05, CI:004-0.06), the percent of urban
    population (β:3.08, CI: 1.05-5.11), percent of Scheduled Caste Population (β: 3.92, CI: 0.12-
    7.72),and district-level testing ratio (β: 0.03, CI: 0.01-0.04) are positively associated with the
    prevalence of COVID-19.
    Conclusion
    COVID-19 cases were heavily concentrated in 9 states of India. Several demographic, socio-
    economic, and health-related variables are correlated with COVID-19 prevalence rate. However,
    after adjusting the role of socio-economic and health-related factors, the COVID-19 infection
    rate was found to be more rampant in districts with a higher population density, a higher
    percentage of the urban population, and a higher percentage of deprived castes and with a higher
    level of testing ratio. The identified hotspots and correlates in this study give crucial information
    for policy discourse.

    Introduction
    With more than16,96,962 confirmed cases on July 31,2020, India ranked third globally in terms
    of the total number of infected patients of COVID-19(1). The rate of spread of the disease was
    slow in the initial three months of the first outbreak in Kerala in January 2020, possibly because
    of the early nationwide lockdown(2–4); widespread coverage about the pandemic in print,
    electronic and social media(5), and targeted efforts by the union and state governments on
    quarantine facilities and travel protocols (6,7). With the demarcation of local containment zones,
    these definitive measures significantly reduced the doubling time (S1Fig.), although there is no
    sign of stalling in the infection rates. There is a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases
    of COVID-19 in many districts. India has been recording over 50,000 new cases every day since
    July 25, 2020. It took 59 days (14 March-18 May) to increase from about 1,000 cases to more
    than 1,00,000 cases (Figure 1), whereas it took only 15 days (May 19- June 2) to add 100,000
    new COVID-19 patients. Afterward, India is adding one hundred thousand new confirmed cases
    every two days.
    Despite such a fast spread of COVID-19, India has a fairly high recovery rate and the lowest
    fatality rate globally(8). Despite India's advantage of having a young age structure less
    susceptible to COVID-19 related deaths(9). India may have to undergo a higher burden of
    disease shortly due to other demographic factors (10) such as the enormous population size, high
    population density, higher percentage of people living in poverty, lower levels of per capita
    public health infrastructure, and a high prevalence of co-morbid situations.
    Like any other health and demographic indicator, COVID-19 infection varies widely among the
    different states of the country (11,12). However, the geographical pattern of the COVID-19
    infection rate' does not coincide with the patterns of demographic and health indicators such as
    the under-five mortality rate or nutritional status. COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly in the
    urban areas, especially in states with megacities with densely populated urban slums like Delhi,
    Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. The sudden surge of return labour migration to the
    states of origin (due to COVID-19 related national lockdown), state-level health care system,
    adherence to physical distancing measures, and local government management are other
    potential community-level factors affecting geographical variations in the spread of COVID-19

    in India. Some recent studies have computed composite indices to rank the districts in terms of
    their COVID-19 vulnerabilities                          using      demographic information and                  infrastructure
    characteristics(13–15).                 While such analyses are useful for district-level planning and
    prioritization they are based on the assumption that vulnerability will decrease as -the districts'
    socio-economic indicators improve. However, such an inverse relationship may not be applicable
    in the rare COVID-19 context; for instance, a higher percentage of urban population may
    indicate a higher socio-economic status of the district population in a non-COVID situation but
    maybe positively correlated with the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 is more prevalent in cities
    and towns than in rural areas or hilly regions(16).Therefore, it is imperative to unfold the
    empirical relationship patterns between the district's socio-economic and infrastructural
    characteristics and the COVID-19 infection ratio. To the best of our knowledge, no such
    previous study has been conducted on COVID-19 in India. This study examined the district level
    socio-economic and demographic correlations of COVID-19 infection ratio in India.
    Identification of such correlates is crucial for framing health policy and appropriate intervention.
    Data and Methods
    We used crowdsourced district-level data on COVID-19 available in the public domain until July
    31, 2020, accessed from the COVID-19India dashboard(17). It is an application programming
    interface (API) to monitor the COVID-19 cases at national, state, and district levels. The data
    compiled in this web portal is based on state bulletins and official handles. The details of the data
    are available on the website. This portal data is consistent with the data provided by the Ministry
    of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/) (18).
    For explanatory variables, we utilized data from the National Family Health Survey of India
    2015-16 (NFHS-4), a cross-sectional survey of 601,599 households, and 2.87 million individuals
    from all 29 states and 7 union territories (19). The survey collected data on various socio-
    economic, demographic, health, and family planning indicators and anthropometry and
    biomarkers' measures related to anemia, hypertension, and diabetes. The NFHS-4 is the most
    recent source of such biomarker-based data at the district level in India. We also used some
    socio-economic and demographic variables from the Census of India(20).

    Outcome variable
    For all the 640 districts in the thirty-five states and eight union territories of India, we defined the
    outcome variable, COVID-19 Infection Ratio (IR), as the number of confirmed cases in a given
    district per 100,000 population. For the district-level population for the year 2020, we projected
    the district population using an exponential growth rate from the census 2001 and 2011.
    The infection of ratio was calculated as:
                                                                               ௜

    ௜ =  the number of confirmed cases in ith district and௜ = total projected population in the ith

    District level correlates
    Based on previous literature(21–24), we considered a set of 26 variables at district level, viz., i)
    Demographic variables: percentage of population aged 60 and above , percentage of women
    whose husbands are                   away for the last 6 months, population density, ii)Socio-economic
    variables: percentage of the literate population, percentage of Scheduled Castes (SC) population,
    percentage of Scheduled Tribes (ST) population, percentage of Hindu population, percentage of
    urban population, average number of persons that sleep in                                  one room; iii) Infrastructure
    variables: percentage of households with availability of soap, percentage of households with
    water and toilet facility within the premise; iv) Health-related variables: percentage of women
    with Diabetes (Glucose>140mg),percentage of women (among                                        age18+)       with Cancer ,
    percentage of 18+aged women consuming tobacco, testing ratio per one hundred thousand
    population, under-five mortality rate, percentage of institutional births, percentage of full
    immunization among children aged 23-36 months, percentage of women aged 18 and above
    reporting anemia and , percentage of children with stunting and wasting.

    Statistical Analysis
    We performed a bi-weekly trend analysis of COVID-19 cases in India. To examine the district
    level correlates of the outcome variable, we carried out a linear regression analysis at the district
    level. Two separate district-level regression models were fitted. Model 1 presents the
    independent variable's unadjusted effect without controlling the effect of any other independent
    variable. Model 2 shows the adjusted results of the independent variables on the dependent
    variable. We did all the analyses in the statistical package Stata14.1. We tested for the possible
    multicollinearity among the independent variables before fitting them to the regression model.
    Spatial Analysis
    We generated descriptive maps of 727 districts in the software package QGIS and later exported
    the shapefiles to GeoDa software to perform spatial analysis. Using the first-order 'Queen's
    contiguity matrix as the weight, we estimated Moran's I and univariate Local Indicators of
    Spatial Association (LISA). 'Moran's I" is the Pearson coefficient measure of spatial
    autocorrelation, which measures the degree to which data points are similar or dissimilar to their
    spatial neighbours (29). The LISA cluster map yields four types of geographical clustering of the
    interest variable (30).
    Here, "high-high" refers to the regions with above-average infection ratio and sharing the
    boundaries with neighbouring areas with above-average infection ratio values. On the other
    hand, "high-low" indicates regions with below-average value and the surrounding areas with
    above-average infection ratio. The "high-high" are also referred to as hot spots, whereas the
    "low-low" referred to as cold spots.
    Results
    India has been reporting new cases of the coronavirus (COVID-19) every day since March 14,
    2020. India reported over 1696 thousand confirmed cases as of July 31, 2020. Out of these,
    around 1095 thousand patients have recovered, while 36,565 cases were fatal (17). S2 Fig. and

    S1 Table presents the national bi-weekly (14 days) national pattern of new confirmed, infected,
    recovered, and deceased COVID-19 cases in India. In India, the average bi-weekly new
    confirmed cases rose 744 times (from 63 to 46,900), the average recovered cases increased 6307
    times (from 5 to 31,533), the average infected cases increased 1152 times (from 63 to 72614).
    The average deceased cases increased 734 times (from 1 to 734) between the 1st and the 10th bi-
    weekly phases, as given in Table A1. The COVID-19 cases have amplified in each of the Indian
    states until July 31, 2020. Therefore, the five states of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil
    Nadu, Karnataka, and Telangana, have accounted for more than half of the country’s total cases.
    The interesting fact is that 80 per cent new cases, 79 per cent recovered cases, 80 per cent
    infected patients, and 90 per cent deaths are from only nine states (Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil
    Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh) in
    India. In the S2 Table, we showed the state-wise Infection Rate (IR) per one hundred thousand
    population till July 31, 2020. India showed that the IR is 42.38 per 100 hundred thousand people.
    The highest IR was observed in Andhra Pradesh (145.0), followed by Maharashtra (123.59) and
    lowest in Chhattisgarh (10.12). However, the states like Delhi (54.03), and Southern states Tamil
    Nadu (76.58), Telangana (45.13), Karnataka (109.43), and Jammu Kashmir (58.81) showed IR
    above the national average. Only two Union Territories, viz., Lakshadweep, and Daman & Diu,
    experienced zero cases during the study period.
    District Pattern
    S3 Fig.in Panel A shows the district-level variations in COVID-19. The size of the bubble in the
    figure indicates the number of positive COVID-19 cases in districts on July 31, 2020. The larger
    the size of the bubble, the higher is the number of positive cases. Of the 736 districts, five urban
    districts contain about 28 per cent of the confirmed cases (Mumbai, 7.02 per cent; Chennai, 6.13
    per cent; Thane, 5.73 per cent; Pune, 5.48 per cent and Bengaluru, 3.41 per cent). About 11 per
    cent of the confirmed cases belongs to another seven majorly urban districts (Hyderabad, Central
    Delhi, Ahmedabad, South East Delhi, Kolkata, West Delhi, and East Godavari,) with at least
    20,000 confirmed cases. About85 per cent (625 districts) have at least 100 confirmed cases each,
    and about 36 per cent (268 districts) have at least one positive confirmed case of COVID-19.

    About two per cent (12 districts) reported at least one positive case of COVID-19 until July 31,
    2020.
    S3 Fig. in Panel B presents the district level infection ratio (IR), defined as the number of
    confirmed cases per 100,000 population by July 31, 2020.The results show that the top four
    worst affected districts (Central Delhi, New Delhi, Palghar, Shahdara) in India have at least
    2,000 (per 100,000 population) IR. Four districts (South East Delhi, Kamrup Metropolitan, North
    Delhi, and Pune) have IR ranging between 1000 to 2000 per one hundred thousand population.
    Nine districts have an infection rate of 500 to 1000 per one hundred thousand people. These are
    Chennai, West Delhi, Thane, Gurugram, Bengaluru Urban, Mumbai, Jangaon, Faridabad, Papum
    Pare).
    S4 Fig. presented the Moran's I and LISA cluster maps for the district infection ratio of COVID-
    19 in India. The 'Moran's I value of 0.333 represents a positive spatial clustering level in the
    COVID-19 infection rate over neighbouring districts. Hotspots of COVID-19 were observed in
    the parts of Konkan coast of Maharashtra (Palghar, Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Satara); the
    southern part from Tamil Nadu (Chennai, Chengalpattu, Thiruvallur, Virudhunagar, and
    Ramanathapuram); parts of Delhi; the northern part of Jammu & Kashmir (Ganderbal and
    Pulwama) whereas cold-spots were observed in central, north-western and north-eastern regions
    of India.
    Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the outcome variable (Infection Ratio) and the 26
    selected exposure variables for the 640 districts. The average infection ratio is 108.40, and the
    values vary between 0 and 5918.43 per one hundred thousand population. The IR is zero in the
    two districts from Arunachal Pradesh (Dibang valley, KrumungKumey) and another two districts
    from the Union Territories (Lakshadweep and Nicobar). All district-level socio-economic
    variables differ substantially among districts. For example, the mean percent of the old age
    population (60 and above) is 8.33, and it varies between 2.46 per cent to 17.82 per cent among
    the districts of India. The percent of women whose husbands are away for the last 6 months, a
    proxy indicator of district-level outmigration, ranged substantially between 1.36 per cent to

    33.60 per cent. Population density (number of persons per square kilometer) varies from 1 in
    Dibang Valley (Arunachal Pradesh) to 36155in northeast Delhi.
    We also observed massive variation in the districts' socio-economic variables, viz, percent
    Hindu, urban, and ST population vary between 0 percent to 100 percent in India's districts. On
    average, 2.92 persons sleep in one room in the Indian districts. On average, 48.14 per cent of the
    households have water facilities, and 61.41 per cent have toilet facilities within the household
    premise. Hygiene practice of availability of soap ranges from less than 17.20 per cent to 98.90
    per cent in India.
    with response t to health-related variables as well, there exists a wide disparity. While the testing
    ratio ranged from 0 to11471 persons per 100 hundred thousand, the percentage of full
    immunization among children ranged from 7.14 to 100. The tobacco consumption among women
    ranged from 0.8 to 88 percent.

    The regression analysis present in Table 2 displays both unadjusted and adjusted coefficients of

    outmigration were associated with IRs in the unadjusted model. In contrast, several socio-
    economic variables, such as the literate population, ST population, and urban population, were
    significantly associated. The percentage of women whose husbands were away for six months is
    associated negatively with IR (β: -0.65, CI: -5.02-7.99). Compared to those with low literacy
    rates, districts with higher literacy rates showed 7.1 times higher likelihood of COVID-19
    infection. Districts with higher levels of infrastructure reported higher levels of IRs. Among the
    health-related variables, percentage of women with diabetes (glucose>140), testing ratio and
    percentage of children immunized were significantly positively correlated with IR in the
    unadjusted model. Districts with high diabetic patients have 21.05-fold higher chance of
    COVID-19 infection in comparison to those with low prevalence of diabetes. However,
    percentage of women consuming tobacco and percentage of children with stunting condition was
    associated positively with COVID-19 prevalence.

    Summary and Discussion
    In terms of the total number of positive cases, India ranked third after the US and Brazil,
    reporting more than one million COVID-19 cases as on July 31, 2020. A further concern is
    India'sCOVID-19 curve remaining on the upward trajectory with no sign of bending like Italy
    and the UK. Due to different demographic transition phases in the states, the trajectory of
    COVID-19 and related intervention cannot be uniform. Our result illustrated the differences in
    COVID-19 cases at the state and district levels with few critical findings.
    First, the spread of COVID-19 has been increasing over time. The average bi-weekly cases show
    that the new, infected, recovered, and deceased cases are growing nationally. Besides, the 80 per
    cent of the new patients, and 90 per cent of the deaths are concentrated in nine Indian states
    (Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal, Gujarat,
    and Uttar Pradesh). On July 31,2020, IR in India is 42.38 per 100 hundred thousand population,
    with the highest in Andhra Pradesh (145.0) followed by Maharashtra (123.6) and the lowest in
    Chhattisgarh (10.1). Only two Union Territories (Lakshadweep and Daman & Diu) have zero IR.
    The most affected cities are Mumbai and Pune in Maharashtra, Kolkata in West Bengal,
    Bangalore in Karnataka, and Chennai in Tamil Nadu, Ahmadabad in Gujarat, and Gurgaon and
    Noida in NCR (National Capital Region). The study identifies the districts at higher risk of
    coronavirus infection in the southern, northern, and western states. We also found six high-risk
    COVID-19infected cities (Mumbai, Chennai, Thane, Pune, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad) in India.
    The apparent concern is that these states also contribute significantly to the Indian economy(32).
    Another important observation of this study is that districts bordering the six metropolitan cities

    were observed to be India's highest hot spots, possibly because they contribute the largest share
    of migrants and commuters to these megacities. This study indicates, in addition to Maharashtra,
    Delhi, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat, states with low socio-economic indicators such as the EAG
    states (Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha,
    Uttarakhand) are more affected due to the lack of health care facilities.
    Secondly, this study examined the district level correlates with the COVID-19 infection ratio in
    India. Our research reveals that the district's infection ratio of COVID-19 is associated with
    various socio-economic variables. However, we observed a statistically significant association
    only with a limited variable. After adjusting the role of socio-economic and health-related
    factors, the COVID-19 infection rate was found to be higher in the districts with a higher level of
    population density, a higher percentage of the urban population, a higher percentage of deprived
    castes and a higher level of testing ratio. High population density might lead to social distancing
    challenges, thereby districts with higher density have higher infection ratio.
    Similarly, as the percentage of the urban population increases, the chances of unavoidable
    economic activities might increase, which exposes more people to the Coronavirus .Previous
    studies also showed that higher population densities in congested slum areas and large towns
    accelerated COVID-19 infection and mortality rates(33–35). The congestion, slum
    concentrations, inadequate housing, and sanitation in poor urban areas may explain such high
    disease. A positive association between COVID-19, IRs and testing ratio indicates
    underreporting of COVID-19, in districts where the testing ratio is low.
    Studies based on individual data show that older people are more vulnerable to COVID-19
    infections (36,37). This study also identified that pre-existing diabetes is positively associated
    with COVID-19 disease(36,37). In our research, we didn’t find such associations, possibly
    because of the study design. Unlike these studies, we are identifying macro-level correlates of
    the COVID-19 infection rate. Interestingly, as population belonging to deprived castes such as
    SCs increase, the chances of COVID-19 increase since SCs are more vulnerable and daily
    laborer they may have higher infection chances.

    Conclusion
    The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a long-term impact on health, economy, and social
    processes globally, including India. Only a clear understanding of the disease's spatial
    distribution and its determinants will help to formulate policies and interventions. Therefore, the
    possible risk factors should be included in policy preparedness and implementation during the
    COVID-19 pandemic.
    We found that population density, urban residence, Scheduled Caste population, and testing rates
    are significantly correlated with the infection ratio (IR). As in urban areas, the population density
    is very high, and social distancing is challenging to maintain, the role of government is crucial in
    combating the pandemic. By ensuring the health and hygiene-related facilities, (providing
    adequate clean water, adequate sanitation, and sewerage facilities, cleaning the city, maintaining
    quarantine centers and public health care institutions, etc.), and improving public distribution
    system to ensure minimum food supply, especially among the urban poor and other deprived
    sub-groups, can help to control the spread of COVID-19 infection.
    More tests are required to classify patients with asymptomatic conditions. Currently, India has a
    population of over 1.3 billion, but till July 31, approximately 18.8 million (lesser than 2 percent)
    tests have been carried out. Simultaneously, people's negligent behavior towards COVID-19
    protocols (say not following the social distancing norms, not wearing the mask in pubic place,
    and coughing without covering mouth) put them at a higher risk. Finally, there is need to
    improve infrastructure (hospitals, ventilators, PPE kits), and human resources (doctors, nurses,
    and frontline workers) in healthcare facilities. Our analysis does have a few limitations. First,
    there is a possibility of under-reporting positive and fatal cases due to a lack of testing or social
    stigma. Hence our data gives the most conservative estimates of infection ratio. Second, for most
    cases, the patients' level of information (such as age, sex, and co-morbidity) is unavailable.
    Therefore, we analyzed the district level determinants instead of individual-level determinants.
    Thus, our results identified the major correlates only at the district level. Finally, we analyzed the
    number of confirmed cases rather than the number of active cases, as the later considers the
    recovery rate and reflects the health service available in a region. We used the number of
