Abstract
Background: Quantifying antibody reactivity against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens at the population
level may help understand individual differences in COVID-19 severity. Pre-existing low antibody cross-
reactivity may be particularly prevalent among childcare providers, including pediatric health care
workers (HCW) who may be more exposed to circulating coronaviruses.
Methods: Cross-sectional study that included adults in the Vancouver area in British Columbia (BC),
Canada, between May 17 and June 19, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was ascertained by measuring
total SARS-CoV-2 IgG/M/A antibodies against a recombinant spike (S1) protein and adjusted for bias
due to false-positive and false-negative test results. A novel, high sensitivity multiplex assay was also
used to profile IgG against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, SARS-CoV and four circulating coronaviruses.
Findings: Among 276 participants (71% HCW), three showed evidence of direct viral exposure, yielding
an adjusted seroprevalence of 0.60% [95%CI 0% – 2.71%], with no difference between HCW and non-
HCW, or between paediatric and adult HCW. Among the 273 unexposed individuals, 7.3% [95%CI 4.5%
– 11.1%], 48.7 [95%CI 42.7% – 54.8%] and 82.4% [95%CI 77.4% – 86.7%] showed antibody reactivity
against SARS-CoV-2 RBD, N or Spike proteins, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 reactivity did not
significantly correlate with age, sex, did not significantly differ between HCW and non-HCW (prevalence
1.0% vs 1.0%; P=1.00) and between pediatric and adult HCW (0.7% vs 1.6%; P=0.54), and modestly
correlated with reactivity to circulating coronaviruses (Spearman rho range: 0.130 to 0.224 for 7
significant (FDR 5%), out of 16 correlations, from 36 correlations tested).
Interpretation: A substantial proportion of individuals showed low, but detectable antibody reactivity
against SARS-CoV-2 antigens in this population despite low evidence of direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic on March 11th, 2020 and has
resulted in more than 36.3 million cases and 1.06 million deaths worldwide as of October 8, 2020.
Although this virus has caused unacceptably high mortality, a majority of cases are asymptomatic (1).
Seroconversion occurs within 2-3 weeks in >99% of individuals with COVID-19, with the spike and
nucleocapsid proteins eliciting strongest antibody responses (2, 3). However, up to 40% of SARS-CoV-2-
unexposed individuals showed T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens, suggesting a high degree
of cross-reactivity from a previous exposure to unidentified heterologous antigens (4, 5).
Four seasonal coronaviruses pre-dated COVID-19 and are known to cause up to 30% of upper respiratory
tract infections (6). Of these endemic coronaviruses, the beta-coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43 are more
structurally similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 40% sequence similarity between their main surface antigen
(the spike protein) and that of SARS-CoV-2, whereas the alpha-coronaviruses, NL63 and 229E, are less
structurally related (7). Since the SARS-CoV and the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemics, interest in the
natural history and antibody levels of circulating coronaviruses across seasons has increased (8, 9). The
potential for pre-existing antibody reactivity against SARS-Cov-2 due to circulating coronaviruses has
been debated (10-13). A main caveat of previous studies is that the assays used may not have been
sensitive enough to detect the low SARS-CoV-2 antigen cross-reactivity in unexposed individuals (14).
Across the world, estimates for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence range from 0.26% to 24.4%, with some
reports suggesting higher rates in health care workers (HCW) (15, 16). Vancouver, British Columbia
(BC), is the third largest metropolitan area in Canada, with a population of 2.5 million people. The
province of BC (population 5.017 million) reported its first COVID-19 case on January 25. In BC, the
epidemiological peak of the pandemic occurred between the third week of March and late April, with the
vast majority of cases occurring in the greater Vancouver area (17). This westernmost Canadian province
has done comparatively well in controlling the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 within its territory (17). Indeed,
a study from the BC Centre for Disease Control (BC CDC) estimated that only 0.55% of individuals in
Vancouver had been directly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 after the first wave. Thus, with its low number of
reported COVID-19 cases, and considering that immunity to circulating coronaviruses is only short-lived
and seasonal (8, 9), BC, represents an interesting setting to compare antibody reactivity against SARS-
CoV-2 arising from a direct exposure to COVID-19 versus the pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 antibody
reactivity in unexposed individuals, within the same population and across the same time period.
The main objective of this study was to determine the population-level seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2,
and antibody reactivity against SARS and circulating coronaviruses in unexposed individuals within the
greater Vancouver area. Understanding that pre-existing reactivity to circulating coronaviruses could be
more prevalent among paediatric HCW (18), a secondary objective of this study was to compare the
SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity profiles between adult, paediatric HCW and non-HCW.
Methods
Study design: Prospective cross-sectional seroprevalence study after the first pandemic wave in BC.
Participants: Adults over 18 years of age from the greater Vancouver metropolitan area were included if
they did not have active COVID-19, did not require self-isolation as per BC provincial public measures or
had recovered from COVID-19 at least 14 days prior to the study visit and blood sample collection.

Recruitment: At the time this study was initiated, the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Canada was not
known and there were little data around the world. To gain more insight, an invitation email was sent
about this study to the following departments at BC Children’s Hospital and BC Women’s Hospital
(together, C&W, the largest pediatric referral hospital centre in BC): pediatric intensive care; pediatric
emergency; family medicine; obstetrics and gynecology; pediatric anesthesiology; and pediatric
otolaryngology. The affiliated research institute, the BC Children’s Hospital Research Institute
(BCCHRI), was also contacted email. The email was also sent to hospitalists and the anesthesiology and
critical care departments at Surrey Memorial Hospital (SMH), the most active hospital site for pandemic
COVID-19 cases in BC. To minimize recruitment bias, all adults who responded to the email and returned
their signed consent form were enrolled sequentially and were invited to give a blood sample, without
triaging. Blood samples were collected at BCCHRI and SMH between May 17 and June 19, 2020 (2,794
COVID-19 cases had been reported in BC by the end of this enrollment period). Written informed consent
was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the University of British Columbia
Children’s & Women’s Research Ethic Board (H20-01205).
Study size: Since there was very little SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence data available at the time and none in
BC or even Canada, no a priori sample size calculation was performed. The recruitment period was
therefore defined by convenience over a three-week period of enrolment, in order to obtain baseline data.
Blood sampling: Blood was drawn in gold-top serum separator tube with polymer gel (BD, cat# 367989);
after at least 30 minutes of clotting at room temperature, the blood sample was then centrifuged at 1,400
G to obtain serum aliquots that were frozen at -80 °C within four hours of collection.
Multiplex antibody assay: A highly sensitive 10-plex assay (Meso Scale Diagnostics, Gaithersburg,
USA) where each antigen is ‘spotted’ into a single well of a 96-well plate (19) was used to measure
antibodies against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens – S-2P native spike protein (20), receptor-binding domain
(RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD) and nucleocapsid (N) protein; the SARS-CoV spike protein; and spike
proteins from circulating beta- (HKU1, OC43) and alpha- (229E and NL63) coronaviruses. Briefly, after
blocking wells with 5% BSA, sera were added at 4 dilutions (1:100, 1:800, 1:25 and 1:10,000) and
incubated with shaking for two hours. Sulfo-tag-labelled anti-IgG detection antibody was added to the
wells and the electrochemiluminescence signal was read using the MSD Sector 600 instrument. Results
are dilution-corrected interpolated values from a standard curve with assigned Arbitrary Units (AU)/mL.
Assignment of AU/mL of serum was performed by Meso Scale Diagnostics and is designed such that
values are comparable to an International Standard Serum (ISS), and such that in the future, bridging to a
WHO International Standard will be possible. In absence of a definable threshold for positive antibody
reactivity for SARS-CoV-2 antigens in unexposed individuals, we used the positive/ negative thresholds
derived from the ROC using likelihood ratios>10 from a comparison of symptomatic COVID-19 cases
versus anonymized sera from healthy adults pre-dating 2019 (19), to estimate the proportion of
individuals showing background antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens.
Commercial chemiluminescent (CLIA) antibody assay: Total antibody (IgA, IgG and IgM) against
recombinant spike (S1) protein was determined using the VITROS 5600 analyser (Ortho-Clinical
Diagnostics, Rochester, New York) according to manufacturer instructions. This is a Health Canada and
FDA-licensed qualitative assay with reported performance and in-house validation indicating sensitivities
>7 days post onset range between 96% and 100% and specificities from 99% to 100% (21, 22).
Variables: The following information about participants was collected by questionnaire: age, sex, the
first three digits of their postal code, whether they were health care workers and the type of profession,
                                                                                                                                                4

their history of travel outside BC since January 1, 2020, and history of COVID-19 symptoms and testing.
SARS-CoV-2-exposed cases were defined by a positive result on the commercial CLIA assay, confirmed
by antibody profiling on the multiplex assay. SARS-CoV-2-unexposed cases were defined by a negative
result on the commercial CLIA assay, validated using the multiplex assay.
Statistical analyses: The seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was calculated by dividing the number of
SARS-CoV-2-exposed (positive) cases by the total number of participants recruited, and adjusted for bias
due to false positive and false negative tests using the Greenland method (14). Differences in proportions
were calculated using a Fisher exact test, with significance threshold at P<0.05. Hierarchical clustering of
antibody levels (based on the multiple assay), was performed on log-transformed, z-score normalized
serology data, using the complete linkage agglomeration method and Euclidean distance measures.
Correlation between antibody levels and metavariables was computed using Spearman correlation,
adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate method (FDR 5%).
Analyses were conducted in R version 4.0.2, R Studio version 3.6.2 and GraphPad Prism version 8.4.
Role of the funding source: This study was funded by unrestricted funding to PML and an Intramural
Research Program of the Vaccine Research Centre (VRC) at the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH). The funders did not play a role in the
design, planning, execution, analysis or publication of the study.
Results
Study population: In total, 276 participants were recruited. Their demographic characteristics are shown
in Table 1, with their area of residence geographically mapped in Supplemental Figure 1. A majority (n
= 196; 71%) of participants were HCW. Nearly half of the participants had travelled outside of BC in
2020, including the USA, Europe, Iran, the Caribbean, Australia, Mexico and Japan. Two study
participants reported a history of PCR-confirmed COVID-19. About 25% of participants reported
COVID-19-associated symptoms more than 14 days prior to the study visit (Table 1).
Serology outcomes: To gain insights into participants’ antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2, we
measured antibody levels against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, SARS-CoV, and the circulating beta-
(HKU1, OC43) and alpha- (229E and NL63) coronaviruses, in the 276 study participants plus three
selected COVID-19 convalescent sera (A, B, C), included as positive controls (Supplemental Figure 2).
All individuals showed high antibody reactivity against circulating coronaviruses, over background.
Three study participants tested positive (CW087, CW0150, FH0037) on the commercial CLIA assay,
including the two individuals with a history of COVID-19 (Supplemental Figure 3). A clustering
analysis based on the multiplex of antibody profiles against the four SARS-CoV-2 antigens of the 276
study participants plus the 3 positive control convalescent sera showed that the three sera that were
reactive on the commercial CLIA assay clustered with the three convalescent sera, but distinctly from the
273 other participants (Supplemental Figure 4). Thus, we established a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of
1.1% [95%CI 0.2% to 3.1%], with 3 seropositive and 273 unexposed participants. After adjustment for
bias using point estimates of specificity and sensitivity of the CLIA assay, the adjusted seroprevalence
estimate in this population was 0.60% [95%CI 0% to 2.71%].
The pattern of antibody reactivity for SARS-CoV-2 antigens was quite distinct between seropositive
individuals, including the convalescent sera, and unexposed individuals. Exposed seroreactive individuals
                                                                                                                                               5

showed high antibodies against Spike, RBD and the N protein (Supplemental Figure 5A). However,
unexposed ones showed variably high antibodies against Spike or RBD (Supplemental Figure 5B, C).
The clinical characteristics of the three SARS-CoV-2-exposed participants are shown in Table 2. Two out
of the three exposed seroreactive participants were HCW: one a pediatric HCW and one a non-pediatric
HCW. There was no difference therefore in seroprevalence between HCW and non-HCW, or between
pediatric and non-pediatric HCW (1.0% vs 1.0%; P=1.00 and 0.7% vs 1.6%; P=0.54, respectively).
Positive antibody reactivity against RBD, N and S-2P native spike proteins was estimated to occur in
7.3% [95%CI 4.5% to 11.1%], 48.7 [95%CI 42.7% – 54.8%] and 82.4% [95%CI 77.4% to 86.7%] of the
273 unexposed participants, respectively. A clustering analysis based on these data showed that antibody
reactivity among these unexposed participants was evenly distributed according to age, sex, HCW status,
travel history and on whether participants thought they had COVID-19 symptoms (Figure 1). Moreover,
we detected no significant correlations between antibody reactivity for any SARS-CoV-2 antigens, age,
sex, recruitment site or travel history (P values from 0.36 to 0.90 adjusted at 5% FDR). On the other hand,
we did detect modest correlation between antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2, and HKU1, NL63 and
X229E, with Spearman rho values ranging from 0.130 - 0.224 for 7 significant (FDR 5%), out of 16
relevant correlations with circulating coronaviruses (Figure 2; Supplemental Table 1).
Discussion
We estimated the seroprevalence from a direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure to be 0.60% [95%CI 0% to 2.71%]
in this population mainly composed of HCW in the greater Vancouver area. Data were confirmed using
both a multiplex and commercial CLIA assays with 100% (6/6) agreement. Reported SARS-CoV-2
seroprevalence data in populations after the first wave vary widely across the world because of various
factors, including the timing of sampling in relation to the pandemic; how countries managed to control
spread of the virus; the target population of the study; and the assay used. Highest rates were reported in
Sweden in May (7.3%) (23), Geneva in April/early May (10.8%) (24), and Madrid in late April/early May
(>10%) (25); lowest rates were reported in BC (17). Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimate
from the current study is consistent with data published by the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC)
and obtained between May 15 and 27, 2020, which reported a 0.55% seroprevalence among 885 residual
sera obtained from an outpatient laboratory network in the Lower Mainland of BC; their study population
represents a wider geographical catchment and did not specifically target HCW (17). The current study
confirms that transmission of COVID-19 in BC after the first wave was low, even among HCW,
contrasting with a high seroprevalence reported among HCW in other studies (16, 26, 27).
The antibody detection combining a commercial and highly sensitive multiplex assays to detect multiple
SARS-CoV-2 antigens allowed us to distinguish antibody profiles between exposed and unexposed
participants, and to identify that a significant proportion of unexposed individuals display antibody
reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This result is consistent with the highly prevalent frequency T cell
reactivity detected in about 40% of non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals in recent studies (4, 5), and
with another smaller study where 12 out of 95 pre-pandemic sera exhibited cross-reactive IgG antibody
reactivity with conserved epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S2 and N), using a flow cytometry method
validated by ELISA (28). Previous seroprevalence studies have either used single-antigen assays, focused
on SARS-CoV-2, or, in the latter case, examined cross-reactivity in selected sera (28). However, the
current study is remarkable by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity at the population level.

The antigen source of SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity in a relatively high proportion of individuals in
the study is unclear. About 25% of participants in this study thought that they had experienced COVID-19
symptoms in the past. However, because the number of reported COVID-19 cases in BC was low, it
seems unlikely that this antibody reactivity results from a direct exposure to the virus; most likely, this
antibody reactivity in unexposed individuals reflects heterologous antigen cross-reactivity. On the other
hand, antibody cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and circulating coronaviruses was modest,
although this is predicted to occur, particularly within beta-coronaviruses, owing to relatively high
sequence similarity (35-40% for nucleocapsid and spike proteins) (7). Antibody cross-reactivity between
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is also expected, due to >75% sequence identity between the spike proteins
from these two viruses (29). Notably, evidence of cross- neutralization between circulating coronavirus
and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (28), raises a possibility that this pre-existing immunity may alter the
clinical course of COVID-19. However, answering this question requires large follow-up studies.
This study has limitations. First, its cross-sectional design and lack of follow-up makes it impossible to
establish whether the antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in unexposed individuals may confer
any immune protection. Second, the non-random method of recruitment method is likely to introduce a
selection bias towards people who wanted to get tested for COVID-19 antibodies. Third, there is a
possibility that a previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure may be underestimated by serology because of lack of
sensitivity, especially early on (<7 days) and possibly also in asymptomatic individuals (30). However,
the low number of reported cases means that this is unlikely to have represented many individuals in BC.
Fourth, the small sample size limited the power for correlation analyses and the precision of estimates.
In conclusion, this study reports frequent and variable antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in
adults from the greater Vancouver area despite a low overall seroprevalence and low evidence of direct
exposure to the virus after the first wave.
