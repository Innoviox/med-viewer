Abstract
We develop a generalized SEIRD model considering social distancing measures to describe the spread of COVID-19 with
applications in Brazil. We assume uncertain scenarios with limited testing capacity, lack of reliable data, under-reporting
of cases, and restricted testing policy. We developed a Bayesian framework for the identification of model parameters
and uncertainty quantification of the model outcomes. A sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the most significant
parameters on either the cumulative numbers of confirmed and death, or the effective reproduction number. We show
the model parameter related to social distancing measures is one of the most influential. Different relaxation strategies
of social distancing measures are then investigated to determine which strategies are viable and less hazardous to the
population. The considered scenario of abrupt social distancing relaxation implemented after the occurrence of the peak
of positively diagnosed cases can prolong the epidemic, with a significant increase of the projected numbers of confirmed
and death cases. A worse scenario occur if the social distancing relaxation policy is implemented before evidence of
the epidemiological control, indicating the importance of the proper choice of when to start relaxing social distancing
measures. The employed approach and subsequent analysis applied over the Brazilian scenarios may be used to other
locations.

 1 1. Introduction
 2 At the end of 2019, the world was taken by the news about the outbreak in China of a new coronavirus called SARS-
 3 CoV-2, which stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. The associated disease, called COVID-19
 4 by the World Health Organization (WHO), rapidly spread around the world and is currently considered a pandemic.
 5 As of September 30, 2020 there have been 235 countries and territories affected, with around 33.8 million confirmed
 6 cases and 1 million confirmed deaths [1]. Coronavirus belongs to a group of viruses that are common in humans and
 7 are responsible for 15% to 30% of cases of common cold [2]. The SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly and has already
 8 affected a significant part of the world’s population [3]. The within-host dynamics seem to be very heterogeneous and
 9 the severity of the disease varies widely. Based on currently available information, elderly people and people of any age
10 with comorbidities, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, are among those at most risk of severe
11 illness from COVID-19. In most locations, the burden of COVID-19 cases requiring medical intensive care exceeds the
12 available medical resources, worsening the situation. A great effort has been made worldwide to better understand the
13 disease and possible mechanisms to control it. Measures such as widespread testing, and reducing social contacts for some
14 age segments, or for the wider population, are known to decrease the speed of the disease spread and the case fatality [4].
15 However, countries often have to deal with limitation of testing capacity for COVID-19 which increases the uncertainty
16 associated with how the disease behaves and is likely to complicate the management of the policies to mitigate and
17 control it. One form to deal with this lack of information is through mathematical modeling, using diversified modeling
18 techniques (see [5] for a review). This type of modeling also has some limitations, because it intrinsically relies on a
19 simplification of reality. One example of such simplification is the usual assumption of constant parameters values (see
20 [6] for an overview of applications and limitations of mathematical modeling for COVID-19). Population-based models
21 that split individuals into classes are widely used, and is the approach followed in this work.
22    WHO has already recognized that testing for COVID-19 is a key way to know how the virus spread and to provide
23 insights on how to respond to it, although widespread testing is low in most countries in the world. In Brazil (BR),
24 for example, the initial testing policy included only severely ill and healthcare practitioners people. The sub-notifi-
25 cation of infected cases was, and still is, a major problem, coupled with incomplete and inconsistent overall data as
26 well as the lack of complete knowledge on the prevalence and progression of the disease [7]. Likewise, the number
27 of deaths may be underestimated for the same reason. Overall, one of the main difficulties in developing predictive
28 compartmental models of the COVID-19 is the lack of reliable data to support parameter choices. In the face of the
29 current scenario, we developed a seven-compartment model that implicitly considers the social distancing policy that
30 isolates individuals from the infection for a period of time. This modeling strategy to consider social distancing is also
31 employed in [8] using a generalization of the standard SIR model. Here we focus on understanding the model response to
32 perturbations/uncertainties. We perform sensitivity analysis and quantify the uncertainties in model outcomes, mainly
33 the cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases, and the effective reproduction number. We also investigate
34 hypothetical scenarios on how to obtain a desired effect/control via a modification to the system subject to uncertainties.
35 Our studied cases include the whole Brazilian scenario (BR) and the state of Rio de Janeiro (RJ), which was one of the
36 first states in BR to recommend and implement social distancing measures, beginning on March 17, 2020 [9]. However,
37 they have not last much longer and RJ has started a progressive social distancing flexibilization, as the whole country
38 [10].
39 2. Mathematical Modeling and Methods
40 2.1. The SEAIRPD-Q Model
41 We develop a generalized Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Removed–Dead (SEIRD) model that includes protective social
42 distancing measures based on the following assumptions: (i) the analysis time is small enough such that natural birth
43 and death are disregarded; (ii) all positively diagnosed individuals, who are severely ill, are hospitalized; (iii) only
44 symptomatic infected and positively tested (diagnosed/hospitalized) individuals may die due to complications from the
45 disease; (iv) the hospitalized individuals are under treatment and remain isolated, so that they are considered not
46 infectious; (v) social distancing measures are restrictive so that isolated individuals are not likely to be infected, and (vi)
47 the recovered/removed individuals acquire immunity. Our SEAIRPD-Q model has seven compartments, including the
48 population of positively diagnosed (P ) individuals who are under medical treatment, and the infected class that is modeled
49 as two separate compartments encompassing individuals with and without symptoms, denoted by I and A, respectively.
50 The removed compartment (R) includes the recovered individuals as well as those under social distancing measures. The
51 mathematical description (differential equations) of the SEAIRPD-Q model and its schematic representation are shown
52 in Fig. 1 while model parameters and related meanings are exhibited in Tables 1 and SM-A.1 (see the Supplementary
53 Material (SM) for more details).

   Susceptible individuals become exposed to COVID-19 when in contact with infected people. The rate at which this
happens may vary depending on whether the infected individual has symptoms or not, denoted by β or µ, respectively.
After an incubation period (1/σ), exposed individuals become infected. The fraction ρ of infected people who present
symptoms can vary widely. Due to the assumption of reduced testing capacity, asymptomatic individuals, as well
as symptomatic infected individuals with mild symptoms, are not likely to be hospitalized and therefore will not be
diagnosed. Those who present symptoms are either isolated or hospitalized. We assume that only symptomatic infected
individuals with stronger symptoms are diagnosed quickly, at a rate of I , and require hospitalization. This assumption
better reflects the policy on only testing severely ill individuals. Following the WHO guideline on social distancing,
most countries around the world are adopting social distancing policies at some extent. An interesting feature of our
model is the assumption that susceptible, exposed, and infected individuals can be kept isolated at a removal rate of ω,
an assumption also taken by [8]. Thus, the removed individuals’ compartment includes individuals who have recovered
from the disease as well as those subjected to social isolation. Asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals can recover
without medical treatment at rates of γA and γI , respectively, and hospitalized individuals recover at a rate of γP . The
cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases are obtained, respectively, from simulation day zero (t0 ) to a desired
time t as:
                                               Z t                              Z t

Following the ideas introduced in [11], we apply the Next Generation Matrix method to obtain R0 for the SEAIRPD-Q
model. Firstly, we use a reduction process to arrive at a linearized infection model, under the disease-free steady state.
The identification of the infected variables (E, A, and I) allows defining the vector xT = [E, I, A], where the superscript
T stands for the transposition of a matrix. Thus, we consider that S, R, P , and D individuals are not able to transmit
the disease. Denoting by T and Σ the transmission and transition matrices, respectively, the three-dimensional linearized

   cumulative confirmed and death cases. With Bayesian calibration, we are capable of determining the most likely uncer-
   tainties for input parameters as well as their maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of marginal distributions described
   by the a posteriori probability distribution πpost . Considering that our aim is to adjust a set of parameters θ given y
   observations, Bayes’ theorem states:

60 Bayesian calibration procedure.
61    Due to paucity data and possible model identifiability issues, we calibrate the following model parameters: β = µ, ω,
62 dI , and dP . All other parameters are gathered from the available literature and listed in Table SM-A.1 (see SM for more
63 details).
64    The code implementation is written in Python language (version 3.7), using PyMC3 as a Probabilistic Programming
65 framework [13]. Due to the intensive computational burden, we choose as calibration method the Cascading Adaptive
66 Transitional Metropolis in Parallel [14], a Transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo available in PyMC3. For the sake
67 of reproducibility, code and scripts are publicly provided at [15]. Of note, the SEAIRPD-Q system of seven ordinary
68 differential equations is solved using the LSODA method [16] from SciPy [17]. This package provides an interface for
69 such routine from ODEPACK [18].
70 2.4. Data
71 We investigate the model behavior for BR and RJ. We gathered data for C and D from [19]. Since Brazilian policy for
72 testing in COVID-19 is still mostly restricted to severe cases, model calibration aims at matching C and D, without
73 accounting the recovered outflow from P . We assessed the epidemiological data of 198 days for BR, ranging from March
74 5, 2020, to September 18, 2020, and 193 days for RJ, ranging from March 10, 2020, to September 18, 2020. The initial
75 dates were chosen considering a minimal requirement of at least five diagnosed individuals at the pandemic initial date.
76 For completeness, all used data are listed in [15].

2.5. Sensitivity Analysis                                                                                                                        77
In order to quantify how changes in the model parameters and some initial conditions (ICs) affect the quantities of
interest (QoI), we apply the Elementary Effects method [20] present in the SALib library [21]. In contrast to local
sensitivity methods, which evaluate how small changes around a singular point affect a QoI [22], the Elementary Effects
method is a globalpsensitivity method. Here we analyze QoI1 (t) = R(t) and the normalized sum of the squares of C
and D, QoI2 (t) = C(t)2 + D(t)2 . Considering θ ∈ Rk as the set of analyzed parameters, we construct a sample of m
initial points θ (1) , . . . , θ (m) from a k-dimensional p-level grid. Afterwards, a metric defined as an elementary effect EEi ,
i = 1, . . . , k, is computed for every parameter:
                                                       QoI(θ1 , . . . , θi−1 , θi + ∆, θi+1 , . . . , θk ) − QoI(θ)
                                          EEi (θ) =                                                                 .                        (8)
                                                                                     ∆
                    1                1
where ∆ ∈ { p−1       , . . . , 1 − p−1 } is the magnitude of change in the ith parameter in the k-dimensional p-level grid. Values
                                                     p
of p as an even number and ∆ = 2(p−1)                    are usual suggested choices to ensure an equal sampling probability in the
parametric space, and are the default option in the SALib library [21]. After computing the elementary effects, the
process ends by calculating the global sensitivity indexes for each parameter. Our work dedicates the analysis only to
the first order sensitivity index:
                                                                             m
                                                                         1 X
                                                                 si =            EEi (θ (j) ).                                               (9)
                                                                         m j=1
Parameters with high scores are the most influential to the QoI. In turn, the first order sensitivity index values allow                         78
ranking the parameters with respect to their order of importance.                                                                                79
2.6. Time Dependent Social Distancing Policy Modeling                                                                                            80
To represent and understand social distancing policy effects on COVID-19 epidemic, we propose a time-dependent
removal rate, which we denote by ωr . Considering that td is the time at which the relaxation policy is implemented, ωr
is defined as the following continuous function:
                                                                   (
                                                                      ω                if t < td
                                                            ωr =          −λ(t−td )
                                                                                                    ,                                       (10)
                                                                      ωe               if t ≥ td
in which λ = ln 2(t1/2 )−1 is the decay constant, with t1/2 being the half-life time for the social distancing release policy.                   81
In this way, ωr is a smooth decreasing function after t = td for which λ regulates the decay speed.                                              82

To properly perform projections and further study different social distancing scenarios of interest, we calibrated the                           84
SEAIRPD-Q model to the data of BR and RJ (separately). We employed a Bayesian calibration of some model parameter                                85
values, with remaining parameter values gathered from the literature. Model parameters are shown in Table 1, while                               86
the frequency histograms for the calibrated parameter posterior marginals and other model factors are presented in the                           87

 89    Taking into account the maintenance of the social distancing policies during the time of the analysis, Fig. 2 exhibits the
 90 fitting and predictions for the COVID-19 pandemic in BR. Fig. 2a shows that the peak of P individuals occurred on the
 91 simulation day 145 (95% CI: 143–146) with around 638.8 thousand (95% CI: 630.6–647.1) people simultaneously infected
 92 (denoted “active cases”, hereinafter). By the end of the simulation time, the model predicts around 149.3 thousand (95%
 93 CI: 145.1–153.6) of deaths and 4.392 million (95% CI: 4.306–4.482) of cumulative cases. The R0 calculated by means of
 94 MAP for BR is 3.09, and the time evolution of R(t) is displayed in Fig. 2b (black line). Notice that R(t) < 1 occurred
 95 around the simulation day 135 (95% CI: 133–136), which indicates that the disease is controlled [26].
 96    We also fitted the model with the available data for RJ. Considering again the maintenance of the social distancing
 97 policy, the projections for COVID-19 infection in RJ are shown in Fig. 3. Of note, model fitting for RJ is much worse
 98 than in the BR scenario, probably driven by highly noisy data. Nevertheless, the model could capture correctly the
 99 peak of active cases, that occurred on the simulation day 115 (95% CI: 114–116) with around 32.2 thousand (95% CI:
100 31.7–32.7) active cases. Also, around 16.6 thousand (95% CI: 16.3–17.0) of deaths and 212.5 thousand (95% CI: 207.6–
101 217.7) of cumulative cases are expected on day 225, when these numbers stabilized. The R0 is 2.68 for RJ, and the time
102 evolution of R(t) is displayed in Fig. 3b (black line). Similarly as for the broader scale of the Brazilian scenario, if the
103 social distancing measures are maintained in RJ, the disease was under control around the simulation day 105 (95% CI:
104 103–107), when the effective reproduction number becomes less than one.
105    We address the sensitivity for both C and D (QoI2 (t)), as well for R(t) (QoI1 (t)). Sensitivity analysis is performed
106 for both scenarios (BR and RJ) considering all parameters and the initial conditions E(0), A(0), and I(0). The settings
107 p = 4 and m = 40 are used for all experiments. A 50% variation around the fixed and MAP values in Table 1 is
108 considered to construct parameter ranges.
109    The sensitivity analysis results for BR are depicted in Fig. 4. The sensitivity indexes for the cumulative C and D
110 (QoI2 (t)) are heavily influenced by the initial conditions in the early stages of the disease propagation, although their
111 influence decreases as time evolves. In contrast, they are not influential for R(t) (QoI1 (t)) along all the simulation
112 time. The influence of the parameter related to social distancing (ω) on both QoIs is remarkable. More importantly, its
113 influence increases with the evolution of time, which emphasizes the need for care when establishing social distancing
114 relaxation measures. On the other hand, the proportion of infected individuals who have symptoms is also one of the
115 most influential parameters on both QoIs, although it is more relevant considering C and D. This points out the need of
116 having a more widespread testing policy. Regarding the RJ scenario, Fig. 5 reveals very similar scores. One noteworthy
117 distinction is the rank of influence of E(0) and I(0) associated with QoI2 (t). The former is more influential in the
118 BR scenario (Fig. 4b), while the latter has a higher score for RJ (Fig. 5b). Overall, the most influential parameter is
119 the removal rate (ω), and its impact increases as the dynamics evolves. The second most influential parameter is the

3.1. A study case: How would different social distancing measures affect the disease spread?                                                             122
We have shown that the rate at which S, E, A, and I are removed due to social distancing measures significantly affect                                   123
R(t), C(t), and D(t). Such average values under the actual social distancing policy are an idealization of reality since                                 124
actual values are dynamic and spatially heterogeneous. However, such idealization is useful to qualitatively analyze                                     125
the effect of different disease control mechanisms. Thus, in order to study the qualitative effects of changes in social                                 126
distancing policies, we propose to model ω as defined in (10), which can represent different social distancing relaxation                                127
scenarios. We consider three cases: (i) a sudden release from social distancing, which is modeled as a decay with half-life                              128
as t1/2 = 0.1 days; (ii) a gradual release, with half-life as t1/2 = 15 days, and (iii) the current social distancing policy, with                       129
constant removal rate. The latter represents the original study case, which can also be obtained by setting td > 400 days.                               130
For cases (i) and (ii), we selected td = 165 days, time for which the peak of active cases has already passed. Fig. 6                                    131
shows the consequences of relaxing social distance measures in terms of the model distributions of C and D for BR at                                     132
t = 397 days. Additional results are displayed in the SM for both BR and RJ scenarios. Remarkably, a sudden release                                      133
can induce an increase in C and D, and their uncertainties, extending the crisis duration due to a slower decrease in the                                134
active cases (see the SM for more details). This effect can also be noted in Figs. 2b and 3b, where we show the time                                     135
evolution of R(t) for cases (i) and (ii) in comparison with the original scenario. Social distancing release policies make                               136
the decrease of R(t) far slower, implying in a slow control of the disease. Thus, determining an appropriate moment                                      137
to begin a social distancing release policy demands special care, since applying such policies in inappropriate times can                                138
maintain a crisis status for a longer-term. Moreover, due to the small changes in R(t) for a longer time, more cases of                                  139
C and D will occur, worsening the health damage in the total population.                                                                                 140
   We also remark the importance of the release date of social distancing measures in the following less favorable scenario.                             141
Considering that social distancing is released 20 days before the peak of the active cases for BR (td = 125 days), disease                               142
spreading can yield a critical scenario even when a smooth and gradual release strategy (half-life as t1/2 = 20 days) is                                 143
adopted, causing an increase in C and D, and a drastically longer pandemic period, as shown in Fig. 7. In this case,                                     144
the peak of active cases would occur on the simulation day 154 (95% CI: 152–158) with around 664.6 thousand (95%                                         145
CI: 651.5–680.8) active cases, and D is expected to be around 270.7 thousand (95% CI: 255.1–288.9) at the end of the                                     146
simulation, with C around 7.976 million (95% CI: 7.542–8.473). Note, however, that the dynamics of C and D did not                                       147
reach the stabilization level, reflecting the more critical scenario mentioned earlier.                                                                  148

149   4. Discussion and Conclusions
150   The present paper contributes to the development of a model framework to investigate the expansion of COVID-19 and
151   the impacts of different measures of social distancing in the presence of uncertainties. We apply the developed approach
152   to model the COVID-19 dynamics in BR and RJ. This high populated Brazilian state was one of the first states to
153   adopt mitigation actions, such as the suspension of classes, cancellation of events, and home isolation [27, 10] (but has
154   not implemented a population quarantine [10]). According to the current data released by the Brazilian Ministry of
155   Health, RJ is one of the most affected states, both in the number of registered cases of COVID-19 and in the number
156   of deaths. For this reason, the present study analyzes the spread in this state, as well as in the country as a whole, in
157   order to assess the particular characteristics of the pandemic at those different spatial scales. Extensive research for the
158   spread of COVID-19 in BR with multiple perspectives has been reported, e.g.,[28, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32]. The present work
159   takes into account factors that are predominant in many underdeveloped countries, such as the current limited testing
                                                                                                                      8

brings some insights or guidelines for public health and policy-makers.                                                                           161
   Due to data paucity, parameter identifiability is a major difficulty. To overcome this issue, only four model parameters                       162
(and two hyperparameters) were calibrated using a Bayesian approach. Other parameters, as well as model initial                                   163
conditions, were set based on available information on COVID-19 (see the SM for more details). Our simulation forecasts                           164
that the peak of active cases occurred on July 28, 2020 (95% CI: 26–29) and July 3, 2020 (95% CI: 2–4) for BR and                                 165
RJ, respectively. This difference can be explained due to the discrepancy of the spatial scale, and the way the disease                           166
has spread along with the different Brazilian locations, considering, for instance, different political measures taken and                        167
the social and demographic structure of each Brazilian locality [33]. The social measures implemented in RJ at the                                168
beginning of the pandemic seemed to be able to flatten the epidemic curve and postpone the peak of active cases [27, 30].                         169
However, as happened to the whole country [10], these initial social distancing measures were not kept on through the                             170
progression of the disease, and that could explain the high number of cases (around 270 thousand confirmed cases and                              171
18 thousand death cases in RJ [34]).                                                                                                              172

173    Aiming to evaluate the influence of uncertainties in hard-to-track populations such as undiagnosed infected individuals
174 (I and A), as well those who carry the disease and are unable to transmit (E), we performed a sensitivity analysis to
175 understand which model factors (parameters and initial conditions) play important roles at the various stages of the
176 epidemic for both BR and RJ. The analysis confirms that a proper understanding of how the disease spreads can provide
177 insights and aids to elaborate containment decisions in order to reduce R(t). In this sense, considering both BR and RJ,
178 sensitivity analysis suggests that the most influential parameter for a long term perspective is the removal rate parameter
179 (ω).
180    We have shown that the rate at which S, E, I and A individuals are removed due to social distancing measures
181 significantly affects R(t), C(t) and D(t). Such average values under the actual social distancing policy are an idealization
182 since actual values are dynamic and spatially heterogeneous, as mentioned in the last paragraph. In order to study the
183 qualitative effects of changes in social distancing policies, we propose to model ω as an exponential decay function,
184 which can represent different social distancing relaxation scenarios. When more abrupt social distancing relaxation is
185 implemented after the occurrence of the peak of active cases, it accompanies a longer extension of the duration of the
186 disease, with approximately 29% increase and much higher uncertainty in the projected numbers of C and D at the end
187 of the simulation. If implemented before the peak, the consequences can be devastating, as indicated by our results.
188 The hypothetical scenario built by considering a slow and gradual release implemented 20 days before the original peak
189 indicates a delay of 9 days in the occurrence of the peak of the active cases, with more than 7.9 million C and about 271
190 thousand D accumulated over less than thirteen months of the presence of the disease in BR. Our simulations highlight
191 the importance of relaxing social distancing measures only under a very careful follow-up.
192    We note that the analysis performed in this paper should be viewed from a qualitative perspective. The conclusions
193 for the considered hypothetical scenarios (with and without social distancing relaxation) are based on model predictions
194 and current employed policies. Model simplifications and the calibration procedure of model parameters can explain
195 potential quantitative discrepancies between our predictions and data. Such simplifications include: (i) homogenization
196 of age, social, and spatial structure, (ii) some model parameters are fixed, with values obtained from the literature, and
197 (iii) model parameters are constant along time (except ω, when investigating the impacts of relaxing social distancing
198 measures). Moreover, data have limited information due to sub-notification, since mostly hospitalized cases are tested in
199 BR. These simplifications are inherent of the modeling procedure, and should be viewed as part of the scientific process
200 of the understanding of the natural phenomena.
201    The present paper can be extended in forthcoming studies, for example, by considering models with spatial hetero-
202 geneity, parameter dependence in time and space, and also analyzing data considering sub-notification. Data considering
203 other BR states could also be analyzed employing the same procedure adopted in the present paper. Another possible
204 extension could be related to the determination of limit thresholds in the number of P cases under different relaxation
205 social distancing measures.
206    It is important to highlight the impacts of social distancing relaxation in order to control the COVID-19 pandemic.
207 The adoption of this type of measure directly affects the evolution of R(t), as shown in our results. For both BR and
208 RJ, it implies a much slower stagnation or decrease in R(t) from the time the measures are implemented. Since R(t) is
209 in a controlled situation for both scenarios, i.e. R(t) < 1, a direct consequence is that the disease would need more time
210 to be eradicated. Our analyses suggest that policies based on short-term social distancing are not enough to control
211 the evolution of the pandemic. If social distancing policy measures are released before the “optimal time”, a second
212 peak should be experienced [28]. Some authors argue that longer or even intermittent social distancing will be necessary
213 to avoid recurrent outbreaks. Specifically, [35] examined a range of likely virus transmission scenarios until 2025 and
214 assessed non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate the outbreak. They concluded that if the new coronavirus behaves
215 in the same matter to similar viruses we can expect the disease to return in the coming years, depending on the level
216 and duration of immunity, an aspect that remains to be clarified in the future. The discovery of a vaccine, or new
217 treatments, coupled with the testing of the population could alleviate the need for severe social distancing measures
218 to control the disease. Until then, the need to maintain social distancing measures, even if intermittently, must be
219 carefully addressed. Concerning the actual stage of development of vaccines for COVID-19, there are already strategies
220 for the future administration of such vaccines. As an extension of the present paper using our proposed model, one could
221 employ the protocol developed in [36] for the search of the best strategies of vaccine administration. Another potential
222 extension of the present paper is to consider the economic impact of the pandemic in terms of different social distancing
223 strategies adopted by different countries. Our proposed model could be extended in a way to couple the epidemiological
224 and economic aspects, and in this way to be able to have a more complete perspective of the effects of the COVID-19
225 pandemic [6].

 6  SM A. Supplementary Material Information
 7  This Supplementary Material (SM) is organized as follows. Sections SM A.1 and SM A.2 expand the Results
 8  section of the main document with additional figures for the BR and RJ scenarios, respectively. The last
 9  part of the document shows additional model setting information and the calibration data used in this work.
10  SM A.1. BR: Additional Results
11  Fig. A.2a shows the prediction of P , I, A, D, and C in BR. A total of 638.8 thousand (95% CI: 630.6–647.1)
12  active cases are expected on the simulation day 145 (95% CI: 143–146), with D and C expected to be around
13  149.3 thousand (95% CI: 145.1–153.6) and 4.392 million (95% CI: 4.306–4.482), respectively. The posterior
14  distribution of the peak position is displayed in Fig. A.2b, with the vertical dashed lines corresponding to
15  those displayed in Fig. A.2a. Fig. A.2c depicts the time evolution of R(t) and displays two vertical lines
16  identifying the credible interval (95% CI: 133–136) of the time above which R(t) ≤ 1. The same lines are
17  depicted in Fig. A.2d that shows the uncertainty associated with that time value.
18  Fig. A.3 provides the model forecasts for the considered hypothetical scenarios of social distancing relaxation.
19  Fig. A.3a shows what to expect in case of a sudden release from social distancing after the simulation day
20  165 (t1/2 = 0.1 days as half-life decay). In this case, C reaches 5.656 million (95% CI: 5.426–5.930) and
21  D 192.2 thousand (95% CI: 183.4–202.4) at the end of the simulation (day 397), which corresponds to an
22  increase of approximately 29% in both values when compared to the original scenario with ω fixed at its
23  MAP estimate. For a gradual release after the simulation day 165 (t1/2 = 15 days as half-life decay), the
24  numbers of C and D at the end of simulation are 4.790 million (95% CI: 4.660–4.941) and 162.8 thousand
25  (95% CI: 157.3–169.0), respectively, as shown in Fig. A.3b. Figs. A.3c and A.3d compare the variability of
26  C and D at the end of simulation in the form of box plots for all scenarios considered. Outliers appear as
27  individual points and the samples medians are depicted in red.
28  SM A.2. RJ: Additional Results
29  Fig. A.5a shows the prediction of P , I, A, D, and C in RJ. A total of 32.2 thousand (95% CI: 31.7–32.7)
30  active cases are expected on the simulation day 115 (95% CI: 114–116), with D and C expected to be around
31  16.6 thousand (95% CI: 16.3–17.0) and 212.5 thousand (95% CI: 207.6–217.7), respectively. The posterior
32  distribution of the peak position is displayed in Fig. A.5b, with the vertical dashed lines corresponding to
33  those displayed in Fig. A.5a. Fig. A.5c depicts the time evolution of R(t) and displays two vertical lines
34  identifying the credible interval (95% CI: 103–107) of the time above which R(t) ≤ 1. The same lines are
35  depicted in Fig. A.5d that shows the uncertainty associated with that time value.
36  Fig. A.6 provides the model forecasts for the considered hypothetical scenarios of social distancing relaxation.
37  Fig. A.6a shows what to expect in case of a sudden release from social distancing after the simulation day
38  165 (t1/2 = 0.1 days as half-life decay). In this case, C reaches 220.5 thousand (95% CI: 214.4–227.7)
39  and D 17.3 thousand (95% CI: 16.9–17.8) at the end of the simulation (day 392), which corresponds to an
40  increase of approximately 4% in both values when compared to the original scenario with ω fixed at its MAP
41  estimate. For a gradual release after the simulation day 165 (t1/2 = 15 days as half-life decay), the numbers
42  of C and D at the end of simulation are 215.2 thousand (95% CI: 210.0–221.1) and 16.8 thousand (95% CI:
43  16.5–17.2), respectively, as shown in Fig. A.6b. Figs. A.6c and A.6d compare the variability of C and D
44  at the end of simulation in the form of box plots for all scenarios considered. Outliers appear as individual
45  points and the samples medians are depicted in red.
