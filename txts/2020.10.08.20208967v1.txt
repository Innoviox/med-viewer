       Abstract
       Introduction: The hyoid bone is deeply involved in three important body
       functions: deglutition, phonation and respiration. Several studies have shown
       that changes in the position of the hyoid bone may influence in pharyngeal size

       with mandibular advancement, thus a forward positioned hyoid bone may be an
       indicator of wide upper airways.
       Objective. To determine the changes in the position of the hyoid bone after
       functional appliance treatment.
       Subjects and methods: 20 children (aged 9-13) that currently visit Hiroshima
       University Hospital actively undergoing FKO activator therapy volunteered for
       this study. Several lateral cephalometric radiographs were indicated and traced
       to assess hyoid bone position changes that might have occurred when actively
       complying with the FKO therapy, said radiographs were procured before active
       functional treatment (T0), during it (T1), and a year after continuous use of this
       appliance (T2). ANOVA tests were done to find statistical significance.
       Results: The results of these tests were analyzed and compared; it was found
       that, the hyoid bone is at a lower position from the mandibular plane and
       Frankfurt horizontal plane after FKO treatment, also the mandible is more
       forward after activator therapy, bringing the hyoid bone forward with it thus
       widening the lowest section of the upper airways.
       Conclusion: The FKO not only induces the proper development of the mandible,
       it also potentially advances the position of the hyoid bone, thus affecting

       Introduction
       The position of the hyoid bone has received considerable attention when it
       concerns to the relation of its placement and the collapsibility of the upper
       airways. Studies have shown that in various samples of several population
       groups, that the changes in the hyoid bone position seem to be related to the
       changes in the mandibular position and other facial structures in general
       (Amayeri et al.,2014).
       Bibby and Preston, (1981), Trenouth, (1999) and Ferraz et al., (2006) previous
       studies have mentioned the importance of the fact that the high relevance of the
       hyoid bone lied in its unique anatomic relationship, when examined in response
       to mandibular advancement in subjects with mild and moderate Obstructive
       Sleep Apnea (OSA). A previous study (Battagel et al., 1999) showed that in the
       protruded mandible the hyoid bone became closer to the mandibular plane in
       the same time it got a more upward position. For this study, we examined
       skeletal Class II children and compared the results to those of skeletal Class I
       children to determine the differences in position of this structure in different
       craniofacial patterns and in different time points, especially after functional
       activator treatment in skeletal Class II children.

       Subjects and methods.
       Bearing in mind the anatomical differences that divide facio-skeletal patterns
       into Class II (SNA,SNB, and ANB angles), the participants of this study were
       evaluated according to the characteristics that the literature consensus agrees
       are skeletal Class I and Class II respectively (table I).
       Other inclusion/exclusion criteria for both groups included the absence of
       systemic diseases including bt not limited to
       For the skeletal Class II children (Activator group) , 20 children, 10 girls and
       10 boys, aged 10.7 +/- 1.8 years old, for the skeletal Class I children (control
       group) , 19 children, 13 boys and 6 girls, aged 10.8 + 1.0 years, who attended
       the orthodontic clinic at Hiroshima University Hospital between 2014-2017
       (table I), volunteered to participate in this study. All children needed to clear an
       inclusion criteria that indicated overall health with no previous history of sleep-
       related child breathing disorders. For the activator group, the subjects needed to
       be in the active stages of myofunctional activator treatment, for the control
       group, the orthodontic appliance used during active treatment was irrelevant as
       long as it did not have a direct influence on the patients’ skeletal growth nor the
       upper airways.

       University (No. E-56). All subjects needed to provide informed consent from
       their parents or guardian prior evaluation.
       Using a lateral cephalometric radiograph to assess different anatomical points
       in relation to the position of the hyoid bone, noting the discrepancy between the
       two previously mentioned skeletal patterns in Japanese children. Furthermore,
       the data was collected in three points in time for the study group, T0,initial
       assessment; T1, with the activator inserted, and T2, final assessment after
       activator therapy, with a mean average of time of 8.3 + 2.3 months elapsed in
       between stages. For the control group T0 and T2 were assessed, with a mean
       average time of 16 + 2.6 months elapsed between stages.
       The analysis that were included in this study incorporated the linear and angular
       measurements used in previous studies and depicted in Figure 1 (Bibby and
       Preston, 1981; Deljo et al., 2012; Jose et al.,2014).
       Previous studies have also remarked on the fact that there is a great variability
       on its position depending on even the slightest movement of the head. Therefore,
       they recommended to determine its position by using the cervical vertebra and
       the mandible as reference points as well the following measurement points:

       The hyoid triangle
       The hyoid triangle allows determination of hyoid bone position in three
       directions and, since it is not dependent on a cranial reference plane,
       incorrectness that may stem from changes in head posture is minimized (Figure
       2) (Bibby and Preston 1981).
       Lower airway space
       Based on the hypothesis that the more anteriorly positioned the hyoid bone is,
       the wider the lower section of the upper airways become, thus, the antero–
       posterior measurements in Figure 3 were proposed and analyzed.
       All lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken in the natural head position by
       an experienced technician and manually traced by the first author, reliability
       was ensured by repeating random traces two weeks after the first trace to check
       for inconsistencies.
       All radiographs were digitized using the free software ImageJ, U.S. National
       Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ ,

       specified. Data are presented as mean + standard deviation (sd); ANOVA tests
       were used to compare the difference between cephalometric results in both
       groups. A p-value of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.
       Results
       After tracing, digitizing and assessing the chosen landmarks and measurement
       points, a statistical difference of P<0.01 was present in H–PP, H–FH and H–
       MP perpendicular measurements. In the sagittal plane, there is an increased
       distance of the hyoid bone from the anterior cranial base (H–SN perpendicular).
       Also, in relation to the mandible, it is shown that the hyoid bone takes a more
       inferior and anterior position when the activator is inserted, and this change is
       kept post–treatment. (table II)
       When assessing the hyoid triangle, a larger distance was noticed between the
       mandible (from Rgn) and the third cervical vertebra (C3). Table II
       The lower airway space especially measured from the base of the epiglottis to
       the pharyngeal wall (LspwEb) shows a significantly (P<0.01) increased sized
       when compared to initial data. (table III)

       Discussion
       The importance of the hyoid bone and its positioning whether anteriorly or
       posteriorly to the upper airways has been debated widely in the dental
       community. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has been done
       comparing healthy skeletal Class I and functional activator treated Class II
       children. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the differences, if
       any, in the position of the hyoid bone in the mentioned groups.
       In the perpendicular plane, it was noted that in the present study, the treatment
       of skeletal Class II malocclusion with an activator resulted in a significant
       (P<0.01) displacement of the hyoid bone in an anterior and inferior direction.
       Findings reported by previous studies, by Battagel et al., (1999), Liu et al.,
       (2000), Almeida et al., (2006), Poon et al., (2008) and Doff et al., (2009),
       showed that the hyoid bone is positioned more upwardly after functional
       appliance therapy. This is a disagreement with the present study, where the
       hyoid bone takes a more inferior position.
       In the present study, the hyoid bone significantly shifts its position to a more
       anterior one, and the linear distance between hyoidale and the third cervical
       vertebra is also increased. The linear distance between the mandible from

       retrognathion and the third cervical vertebra is significantly (P<0.01) increased
       as well. This anterior displacement present in this study may be due to the
       functional therapy. Ordubazari et al., (1998) disagrees with these results. Other
       studies agree with the present research (Battagel et al.,1999; Zhou et al.,2000;
       Yassei et al.,2012)
       The present study also revealed that at T2 (roughly a year after the beginning of
       activator therapy) the hyoid bone continued to be anteriorly displaced. Taking
       into consideration that the hyoid bone displaces itself in the anterior direction
       during growth (Ordubazari et al.,1998), this anterior shift could be explained
       with the stability of the lower jaw and an increased ANB changes after
       functional therapy and stretching of the genioglossus muscle (Yassei et
       al.,2012).
       The lowest section of the upper airways as affected by displacement to the
       anterior direction of the hyoid bone as induced by the activator are also
       significantly (P<0.01) increased. Of the two newly proposed linear distances,
       the most inferior one (LspwEb) experiences a significant (P<0.01) increase
       from T0 to T1 in the Activator group, and the achieved enlargement is kept
       stable (P<0.05) at T2. This may be explained with the fact that as the activator

       places the mandible in a more anterior position, the base of the tongue along
       with the hyoid bone is dragged forward by the muscles.
       Conclusion
       The hyoid bone takes a more anterior position when the activator is inserted
       thus increasing the size of the lowest section of the upper airways. Due to the
       tendency towards collapsibility of the airways during sleep, a widening of the
       lower section of the airways could be seen as a positive side effect of continuous
       use of the Activator appliance. Whether these changes are kept throughout
       growth and development is a prospect that could be investigated in the future.
