  42      Synopsis
  43      Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance of bloodstream infections is
  44      challenging in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), limited laboratory capacity
  45      preventing routine patient-level susceptibility testing. Other specimen types could provide an
  46      effective approach to surveillance.
  47
  48      Objectives: Our study aims to systematically evaluate the relationship between resistance
  49      prevalence in non-sterile sites and bloodstream infections.
  50
  51      Methods: Associations between resistance rates in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
  52      aureus isolates from blood and other specimens were estimated in Oxfordshire, UK, 1998-
  53      2018, comparing proportions resistant in each calendar year using time series cross-
  54      correlations and across drug-years. We repeated analysis across publicly-available data from
  55      four high-income and 12 middle-income countries, and in three hospitals/programmes in
  56      LMICs.
  57
  58      Results: 8102 E. coli bloodstream infections, 322087 E. coli urinary tract infections, 6952 S.
  59      aureus bloodstream infections and 112074 S. aureus non-sterile site cultures were included
  60      from Oxfordshire. Resistance trends over time in blood versus other specimens were strongly
  61      correlated (maximum cross-correlation 0.51-0.99, strongest associations in the same year for
  62      18/27 pathogen-drug combinations). Resistance prevalence was broadly congruent across
  63      drug-years for each species. 276/312 (88%) species-drug-years had resistance prevalence in
  64      other specimen types within ±10% of that blood isolates. Results were similar across multiple
  65      countries and hospitals/programmes in high/middle/low income-settings.

  67      Conclusions: Resistance in bloodstream and less invasive infections are strongly related over
  68      time, suggesting the latter could be a surveillance tool for AMR in LMICs. These infection
  69      sites are easier to sample and cheaper to obtain the necessary numbers of susceptibility tests,
  70      providing more cost-effective evidence for decisions including empiric antibiotic
  71      recommendations.

  73      Introduction
  74      Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is among the top ten global health threats,1 and is
  75      particularly acute in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs).2–4 Surveillance is a key tool
  76      to combat rising AMR, as highlighted by the World Health Organization (WHO)5 and
  77      formalised in its Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS),6,7
  78      particularly in LMICs where lack of laboratory capacity prevents routine patient-level
  79      antimicrobial susceptibility testing.8 The lack of surveillance data was identified as a key
  80      contributor to global AMR,9 since the broad-spectrum empiric treatment approach that is
  81      pragmatic in hospitals with limited laboratory facilities2,10 generally results in
  82      overtreatment.11 Strengthening surveillance capacity in LMICs is therefore a major focus of
  83      international initiatives. To date, these programmes have generally focused on improving
  84      capacity for blood culture surveillance due to their high mortality; however, this requires
  85      substantial capital investment and sustainable funding for LMICs, where baseline laboratory
  86      functioning is poor.12 Blood cultures are comparatively costly, require trained staff due to the
  87      invasive nature of blood sampling, and can have slow turnaround times, reducing their ability
  88      to inform individual clinical management. Additionally, the low positivity rate means that
  89      very high sample throughput is needed to confidently estimate resistance prevalence.
  90      Consequently, empirical treatment guidelines are largely uninformed by local resistance rates
  91      in LMICs.
  92
  93      One way to address this would be to assess resistance rates using data from cheaper, easier
  94      non-invasive samples. Reflecting this, the 2020 WHO GLASS report includes resistance
  95      prevalence in urine cultures for key Gram-negative pathogens. However, associations
  96      between resistance rates in blood and other specimens have been rarely studied
  97      longitudinally. A 2018 report for South Korea observed similar resistance rates in E. coli

  98      blood cultures and urine isolates in 2016.13 A 2018 study showed statistical non-equivalence
  99      of antimicrobial susceptibility in nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica from blood, urine and
 100      faecal samples from 2015 U.S. National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System data.14
 101      Longitudinal surveillance of Escherichia coli bloodstream and urinary infections in a large
 102      UK region (Oxfordshire) found similar trends in co-amoxiclav resistance over 19 years.15
 103      Another Oxfordshire study also found similar trends over time in nosocomial methicillin-
 104      resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates from blood and non-blood clinical samples between
 105      1998 and 2006,16 but changes in trends were identified earlier from non-blood samples due to
 106      higher numbers. This raises the broader question as to whether, for multiple pathogen-drug
 107      combinations, the proportion of resistant bloodstream infections could be estimated by the
 108      proportion of resistant isolates from other body-sites, that are easier to sample from, and
 109      more often culture-positive, reducing the costs per drug phenotype obtained. Using the latter
 110      as a surveillance method for the former is attractive because setting up a laboratory and
 111      providing the infrastructure (e.g. reagents, personnel, electricity etc.) to conduct blood culture
 112      surveillance in LMICs approximately doubles the costs compared to urine culture
 113      surveillance.17 Their large numbers make them ideal for developing locally relevant empiric
 114      treatment guidelines.
 115
 116      We therefore investigated the annual prevalence of resistance in isolates from blood and other
 117      body-sites for multiple pathogen-drug combinations in Oxfordshire (regional analysis, high-
 118      income country (HIC)). We then extended the analysis, first to consider concurrent or
 119      previous isolates in the same patient, and second to consider other world regions through
 120      publicly available datasets (Antimicrobial Testing Leadership and Surveillance (ATLAS)18)
 121      and collaborating hospitals/programmes in LMICs with available data.

 123      Materials and methods
 124      We obtained antibiograms for E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus
 125      pneumoniae, and Enterococcus spp. from the Infections in Oxfordshire Research Database
 126      (IORD),19 from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2018, which includes all microbiology tests
 127      performed for the region of approximately 680,000 individuals, and has Research Ethics
 128      Committee and Confidentiality Advisory Group approval (19/SC/0403, 19/CAG/0144) as a
 129      de-identified electronic research database. We compared E. coli and Klebsiella bloodstream
 130      infections (BSI) versus urinary tract infections (UTI); and isolates from blood versus all other
 131      body-sites of infection for other pathogens (non-blood infections; excluding surveillance
 132      swabs), further sub-divided into sterile versus non-sterile for S. aureus (Supplementary
 133      Methods). We estimated yearly resistance prevalence for all antimicrobials with
 134      susceptibilities for >65% samples in that year (mostly >80%). Testing used manual disk
 135      diffusion before 2013, and thereafter automated testing with the BD PhoenixTM Automated
 136      Microbiology System, Beckton Dickinson. Resistance was as defined by the laboratory when
 137      the test was done, using the same breakpoints regardless of specimen type, following
 138      European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility testing (EUCAST) recommendations
 139      for bloodstream infections in each year.20 We did not de-duplicate isolates by patient,
 140      reflecting data that would be easily available from routine laboratory systems.
 141
 142      For each pathogen-drug combination, we first estimated the proportion resistant in blood
 143      versus other samples in each calendar year (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) using Lin’s
 144      concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) for comparisons.21 We used time-series cross-
 145      correlation functions to identify the time differences at which the correlation between
 146      resistance prevalence was strongest. As perfect agreement is unrealistic, we also considered
 147      agreement within what might be considered clinically acceptable error (±5% and ±10%

 148      difference in prevalence), and agreement within arbitrary categories which may nevertheless
 149      be clinically helpful, specifically: <5% resistance (most would readily prescribe an
 150      antibiotic), 5-10% (most would prescribe for mild infections), 10-20% (unclear) and >20%
 151      (many would not prescribe if other options were available). We used logistic random-effects
 152      meta-analysis to estimate the overall difference between resistance prevalence in the two
 153      sample types, treating every calendar year as an independent study, assessing heterogeneity
 154      across years using the I2 statistic.22 We used meta-regression to estimate the effect of calendar
 155      year on the proportion of resistant bloodstream isolates (with its standard error), assuming the
 156      proportion of resistant isolates from other infection sites was known (given their greater
 157      numbers). We also used meta-regression to directly estimate the association between log odds
 158      of resistance in bloodstream infections (outcome, with its standard error) and the log odds of
 159      resistance in other infection sites (explanatory variable, fixed). (Full details in the
 160      Supplementary Material.)
 161
 162      One possibility is that resistance rates differ between blood and other infection sites because
 163      of differences in the underlying populations being sampled. A secondary analysis therefore
 164      considered matched pairs of isolates from the same patient, selecting the closest culture from
 165      a different site up to 3 days before or 2 days after the blood culture,15 assessing concordance
 166      using McNemar’s test. We also considered whether susceptibility of a previous E. coli UTI
 167      could predict susceptibility of a subsequent E. coli BSI, by selecting the temporally closest
 168      urine culture taken between 3-90 days before the blood culture.15,23
 169
 170      We also analysed pathogen-drug combinations at the country level (pooling multiple
 171      hospitals/regions) using the ATLAS dataset, comprising 633,820 isolates from 73 countries
 172      between 2004-2017.18 We considered all years where at least 30 isolates were tested for a

 173      given drug in LMICs (95% CI width around prevalence always <37%); and 100 isolates for
 174      HIC (width <20%) given greater numbers from HIC and strong inverse association between
 175      numbers tested and resistance prevalence in HIC, suggesting preferential testing of resistant
 176      isolates. Finally, we also analysed microbiology data from Angkor Hospital for Children
 177      (Siem Reap, Cambodia), Mahosot Hospital (Vientiane, Laos), and the Shoklo Malaria
 178      Research Unit (Mae Sot, Thailand, serving migrant and refugee populations on the Thailand-
 179      Myanmar border), including antibiotics tested for >40% of the isolates across all study years.
 180      Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using disk diffusion and results
 181      interpreted using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2019 breakpoints.
 182      Intermediate isolates were considered non-susceptible. Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase
 183      (ESBL) status was confirmed using the double disk method (ceftazidime+/-clavulanate and
 184      cefotaxime+/-clavulanate) as a ≥5mm increase in a zone diameter for either agent with
 185      clavulanic acid.
 186
 187      We conducted all analyses using R 3.5.1, using the metafor package for meta-analyses.24
 188
 189      Results
 190      We focused initially on E. coli and S. aureus as two of the most common bacteria causing
 191      BSI,2,25,26 and often causing urine or skin and soft tissue infections, respectively. We included
 192      8102 E. coli BSI and 322087 E. coli UTI (40-fold higher) from Oxfordshire (Supplementary
 193      Figure 1); 4 antibiotics (amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim) were
 194      consistently tested in both between 1998-2018. Whilst absolute resistance prevalence was
 195      generally slightly higher in bloodstream isolates, trends in the proportion of resistant BSI and
 196      UTI were very similar, notably tracking substantial fluctuations over time in trimethoprim
 197      resistance (Figure 1, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure 2), with resistance

 198      rates in the same year most strongly correlated (maximum cross-correlation at lag 0). For
 199      these four antibiotics, there was no evidence of strong variation in the relationship between
 200      resistance rates over time (Supplementary Table 1).
 201
 202      Including a further six antibiotics (aztreonam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, co-trimoxazole,
 203      ertapenem, gentamicin, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam) consistently tested between
 204      2013-2018 (Supplementary Figure 3, Supplementary Table 1) increased the range of
 205      resistance prevalences observed. Again, resistance rates were slightly higher in BSI and
 206      showed reasonable concordance with resistance in UTI, with prevalences within 10% of each
 207      other in 109/132 (89%) drug-years (Figure 2, left-hand panel, Table 1). Overall resistance
 208      prevalence in BSI was highly correlated with resistance prevalence in UTI (CCC=0.93 (95%
 209      CI 0.91-0.95) (Table 1). Agreement was also relatively high across our four pre-defined
 210      resistance categories, with 83/132 (63%) drug-years in the same resistance category and
 211      45/132 (34%) in adjacent categories (Figure 2, right-hand panel). Although numbers were
 212      smaller, broadly similar results were seen for Klebsiella spp. (Figure 2, Table 1,
 213      Supplementary Figures 4&5, Supplementary Tables 1&2).
 214
 215      Considering matched pairs of isolates from individual patients, there was no evidence that the
 216      modestly different resistance rates seen in E. coli BSIs and UTIs overall were due to
 217      differential sampling of intrinsically different underlying populations, given high but
 218      similarly imperfect agreement in susceptibility (86-100% across 11 antibiotics for concurrent
 219      infections, 80-94% for previous infections, Supplementary Table 5). In particular,
 220      considering the closest prior E. coli UTI 3-90 days before a BSI, >80% resistant UTIs also
 221      had a resistant BSI across these four drugs.

 223      Between 1998-2018, there were 6952 S. aureus BSIs and 166179 S. aureus non-blood
 224      cultures: 54105 (33%) from sterile sites and 112074 (67%) from non-sterile sites (8- and 16-
 225      fold higher respectively, Supplementary Figure 1). Ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and
 226      oxacillin presented similar trends in the proportions resistant over time in the different sample
 227      types, which varied substantially over time (Figure 1, Supplementary Table 1,
 228      Supplementary Figure 6), again supporting the plausibility of using non-blood cultures as a
 229      proxy for blood culture surveillance. Agreement was poorer for gentamicin and tetracycline
 230      resistance, although rates were low (<15%). As might be expected, agreement was slightly
 231      better between resistance prevalence in blood and other sterile site cultures than blood and
 232      non-sterile site cultures (Supplementary Figure 7). As agreement was reasonable in both,
 233      and non-sterile site cultures would be more likely to be taken in LMICs, we focussed on this
 234      group of infection sites. Overall, resistance prevalence was more similar in bloodstream and
 235      other non-sterile infection sites in S. aureus than E. coli (Supplementary Table 1), but there
 236      were also slightly stronger effects of calendar time for S. aureus, reflecting generally higher
 237      rates of resistance in blood compared with non-sterile site cultures during the MRSA
 238      epidemic in the mid-2000s, which then became more similar (Supplementary Figure 3).
 239
 240      For S. aureus, including other antibiotics tested between 2013-2018 only, resistance
 241      prevalences in blood and non-sterile site cultures were within 10% of each other in 167/180
 242      (93%) drug-years, with 132 (73%) drug-years in the same resistance category and 45 (25%)
 243      in adjacent categories (Figure 2, Table 1). Overall resistance prevalence in blood was highly
 244      correlated with resistance prevalence in non-sterile isolates (CCC=0.97 (0.95-0.97)) (Table
 245      1). Overall agreement between resistance in concurrent blood and non-sterile cultures within
 246      a patient was extremely high (96-100%) for S. aureus, with ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and
 247      oxacillin having <5% of resistant blood cultures with susceptible non-sterile cultures and

 248      <4% susceptible blood cultures with resistant non-sterile sites cultures (Supplementary
 249      Table 5). Again, although numbers were smaller, broadly similar results were seen for S.
 250      pneumoniae, E. faecalis and E. faecium (Figure 2, Table 1, Supplementary Figure 8,
 251      Supplementary Tables 1&2).
 252
 253      In the ATLAS dataset, there were 401 and 155 country-drug-years with >100 E. coli and S.
 254      aureus isolates from HICs, respectively, from both bloodstream and urinary/non-sterile
 255      infections (Supplementary Table 3). For E. coli, time trends could be estimated over 7 years
 256      or more in four countries for 11 antibiotics, and were broadly similar (Figure 3; S. aureus in
 257      Supplementary Figure 9). Across all drugs, prevalence of resistance in E. coli BSIs and
 258      UTIs were within 10% of each other in 376/401 (94%) country-drug-years (Figure 4, left-
 259      hand panel, Table 1); 326 (81%) country-drug-years were in the same resistance category
 260      and 74 (18%) in adjacent categories (Figure 4, right column). For S. aureus, respective
 261      figures were 147/155 (95%), 154 (99%) and 1 (1%). Agreement was similar in middle-
 262      income countries where smaller numbers of isolates were available (Figure 4, Table 1,
 263      Supplementary Figures 10&11) and in other pathogens (Supplementary Figures 12-16).
 264
 265      Considering hospital/programme-level LMIC datasets, numbers were smaller
 266      (Supplementary Table 4) and hence estimates more variable, but both time trends (Figure
 267      5, Supplementary Figure 17) and comparisons of individual country-drug-years (Figure 6,
 268      Table 1, Supplementary Figure 18) supported overall findings that resistance profiles in
 269      non-blood culture isolates correlate well with those in blood culture isolates over time.

 271      Discussion
 272      Here, we show that AMR prevalence from infections in sites other than blood could
 273      potentially be used to infer AMR in bloodstream infections, which could reduce the initial
 274      costs of AMR surveillance in LMICs. Focusing on two of the most common bacteria causing
 275      serious infections, E. coli and S. aureus, we found that, whilst not perfect, agreement between
 276      the resistant rates in blood cultures and in other clinical cultures was good for most
 277      antibiotics, in terms of actual values, but, most importantly for surveillance, over time. This
 278      suggests that changes in resistance over time could be monitored using samples that are
 279      easier to collect than blood, and could also inform appropriateness of different empirical
 280      antimicrobial therapies.
 281
 282      Whilst many studies estimate resistance prevalence in various infection sites, to our
 283      knowledge, very few studies have directly compared resistance in blood versus other
 284      infection sites, either focussing on one specific drug-pathogen combination,16 or on
 285      Enterobacterales and investigating metagenomics from pooled human samples from the UK,
 286      Kenya and Cambodia as a predictor of resistance in invasive infections.27 In 2011, Health
 287      Protection Scotland and National Services Scotland published a protocol for the surveillance
 288      of AMR in UTIs, arguing that it would be more appropriate to monitor resistance in other
 289      sites where an infection initially starts before entering the bloodstream.28 However, the
 290      hypothesised relationship was not analysed using the data collected.29 WHO piloted a similar
 291      approach but did not compare with resistance rates in BSI.30
 292
 293      Current efforts on AMR surveillance in LMICs are directed towards building laboratories and
 294      training staff to carry out antimicrobial susceptibility testing on blood cultures, arguing that if
 295      this can be achieved, other types of culture will become possible too. However, setting up

 296      such systems is very expensive, both in terms of infrastructural and running costs, and it will
 297      be many years until sufficient data on blood cultures have been accumulated for surveillance
 298      purposes, particularly given initial low uptake and low rates of positivity in these samples.
 299      While longitudinal surveillance data is available at a limited number of research sites, these
 300      programmes cover a limited geographic area and may not be representative of other locations
 301      in a country. Incorporating blood culture testing into public hospitals may be further biased
 302      by differences in ability to pay.2 Collecting specimens from urine/skin surface/genital sites is
 303      cheaper and less invasive than sampling blood, and therefore substantially easier to do on
 304      large numbers from different communities, as well as having higher positivity rates,
 305      increasing their utility for AMR surveillance. This is true even in HICs, with clearly narrower
 306      confidence intervals from larger numbers of non-blood Oxfordshire isolates. Even allowing
 307      for the greater manual processing needed for non-blood cultures, for example, obtaining 100
 308      E. coli isolates would only require testing 361 urine samples assuming 37% are culture-
 309      positive and 75% of these are E. coli, but 7693 blood cultures, assuming 13% are positive and
 310      10% of these are E. coli (estimates based on Oxfordshire data 1998-2016). Whilst blood
 311      cultures may be perceived as having greater diagnostic utility, this may be limited practically,
 312      e.g. by long turnaround times.
 313
 314      One strength of our study is the different datasets used, and the robustness of findings across
 315      these, including continuous surveillance of one large region (Oxfordshire), and global
 316      analysis (ATLAS) albeit of a selection of infections within each country. The
 317      hospital/programme-level LMIC datasets are highly curated, but relatively small. One crucial
 318      underpinning assumption is that pathogens causing other infections are representative of
 319      pathogens causing BSI in terms of antibiogram, either because the source of infection is
 320      commonly from commensal colonising organisms that become pathogenic opportunistically

 321      or because both types of infection arise from a similar reservoir. Even though this may hold
 322      within the populations studied, it is possible, although fairly unlikely, that this may not
 323      generalise more widely. Generalisability is supported by the good country-level agreement in
 324      ATLAS, even though pooling different regions within countries, which could have
 325      potentially differed further between blood and other infection sites. This raises an important
 326      limitation of our approach, namely that different people were sampled for blood and other
 327      specimens. However, our analysis of samples from the same patients suggests this is unlikely
 328      to cause major bias. Another limitation is that we have only considered surveillance of the
 329      proportion of resistant infections, not numbers or population-level rates of resistance;
 330      however, in terms of empiric treatment recommendations, proportions rather than absolute
 331      numbers that are generally of interest. We have not considered surveillance of AMR across
 332      the entire antibiogram, i.e. patterns of resistance within one isolate across different
 333      antibiotics. We also pooled all samples together: in future work we could consider whether
 334      relationships are generalizable between different groups of patients (e.g. by age,
 335      nosocomial/community infections). Finally, the thresholds we considered were arbitrary,
 336      which is why we considered two different approaches (varying margins of error and varying
 337      categorical thresholds).
 338
 339      One question is how good the agreement between resistance rates in isolates from blood
 340      versus other specimens should be for surveillance of resistance in samples from other body-
 341      sites to be useful – clinically and for understanding overall trends. In our dataset, different
 342      resistance rates were observed in different sample types for many pathogen-drug
 343      combinations, with some variation over time and less than perfect agreement. However,
 344      cross-correlations were generally high, as was agreement within 10% and across categories
 345      that could inform empirical antimicrobial therapy. Several biological reasons for the lack of

 346      perfect agreement are plausible: for example, a large proportion of E. coli BSIs have a
 347      urinary focus, but susceptibility and appropriate empiric treatment generally limit progression
 348      to BSI, in contrast to resistant, and perhaps sub-optimally treated UTIs. Hence one might
 349      expect the proportion of drug-resistant BSIs to be higher due to inadequate empiric treatment
 350      of a drug-resistant UTI, but underlying time trends to track each other, as we observed. One
 351      could ask whether blood is the best sample for AMR surveillance. BSIs are the most serious
 352      infection, so risks associated with inappropriate antibiotic treatment are highest, but
 353      potentially treating the many other less serious infections correctly might mean fewer
 354      develop into BSI.
 355
 356      In HICs, susceptibility testing is still not instantaneous, with microbiology results generally
 357      taking at least 48 hours, time during which empiric antimicrobials are administered,
 358      potentially leading to poorer outcomes if the infection is caused by a resistant organism.3
 359      However, increasing use of electronic health records means it is becoming much simpler to
 360      check for previous UTIs and use this to guide empiric treatment. Our paired analysis
 361      illustrates the potential of this approach based on an arbitrarily chosen interval of 3-90 days
 362      prior to the BSI; future work could investigate how the strength of this association varies
 363      further back in time, or using the most resistant rather than most recent urinary isolate.
 364      Similarly, Yelin et al.31 found that incorporating demographic information with susceptibility
 365      results of previous UTIs and antibiotic purchases in a machine learning model improved
 366      guidance of empirical treatment for new community-acquired UTIs.
 367
 368      AMR surveillance plays a key role in optimising the use of antibiotics and hence reducing
 369      resistance: asking clinicians to reduce antibiotic use and running successful stewardship
 370      programmes cannot be done in an information vacuum, and lack of microbiology facilities

 371      and unwillingness of patients to have samples taken (often due to cost) have been identified
 372      as key factors influencing antibiotic use.32,33 LMICs face numerous challenges in setting up
 373      surveillance systems similar to those in HICs, including lack of coherent governance, budget,
 374      technical expertise, information technology systems and co-ordination. Our study shows that
 375      body-sites which are easier to sample, cheaper, faster and easier to grow from compared to
 376      blood could provide a feasible approach to AMR surveillance, providing evidence for empiric
 377      treatment recommendations. They could also be amenable to survey-type approaches which
 378      could be particularly valuable as setting up a local laboratory infrastructure for successful and
 379      useful antibiogram production is challenging. Using population level surveillance as a
 380      substitute for individual patient testing could be considered a pragmatic steppingstone in
 381      improving a site’s diagnostic capacity for individual patient management. Nevertheless, the
 382      urgent threat posed by AMR demands that we not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
